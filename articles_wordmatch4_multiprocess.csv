The final project by Akira Toriyama, Dragon Ball Daima, concluded last month, leaving fans with nostalgic and bittersweet feelings. The acclaimed and beloved author wrote the story, designed the characters, and oversaw the production. The story takes place shortly after the Majin Buu Saga, as Goku and his friends face another major problem – they are turned into children. The culprit behind this is the new Supreme Demon King Gomah, who takes the throne after Dabura's death. Gomah has never seen people nearly as powerful as Goku and his friends and is afraid that someday they will attack the Demon World too. Videos by ComicBook.com The story continues as Goku and the others travel all the way to the other world in hopes of acquiring their dragon balls. The anime was released around the same time as the manga's 40th anniversary and captured fans' hearts with gorgeous animation, expansive world-building, and adorable character design. When the anime entered its final stretch, it included an unexpected transformation, Super Saiyan 4, which fans adore more than ever. The transformation was first introduced in Dragon Ball GT but has never been considered canon until now. While the anime has ended, it didn't answer a major question fans were looking for, with a bizarre, supposedly coded message in the episode titles. [RELATED:Dragon Ball Daima Was Great, But It Could've Been Better With One More Scene] Dragon Ball Daima Episode Titles Were Suspected of Hiding a Secret Message During the New Year's special, All Night Nippon – Dragon Ball 40th Anniversary Special, Dragon Ball Daima's Executive Producer, Akio Iyoku, discussed the series. The 20-minute program was made available on Radiko's official website. Since the original broadcast was in Japanese, @peraperayume on X (previously known as Twitter) translated and highlighted key points. Iyoku revealed that the episode titles hold a hidden meaning, which will only be unveiled after the season concludes. However, he refrained from providing further details, as it was meant to be a significant aspect of the show. Each episode title has one character highlighted in red. The idea was that these characters from all twenty episodes would have a special meaning. However, even after the anime was concluded, there was no explanation about the episode titles. Since the letters are in Japanese, it's more difficult for global fans to figure out the meaning. Even though the anime has ended, Iyoku hasn't stepped forward to explain it yet. It's possible that it contains some kind of wordplay, but we can't know for sure. Forming a coherent Japanese sentence using only those letters is nearly impossible, especially while using each one only once, but it might not strictly be meant as a written message. It's been a popular puzzle, tied to the titles' usage of each of the 20 dakuon katakana, essentially Japanese letters with two muddy accent marks. @Herms98 on X tried to solve this puzzle and came up with an answer. While it doesn't fully explain everything, the user believes it corresponds to each of the twenty episodes of Dragon Ball Daima. The finale aired right before March 1st, 2025, the first anniversary of Toriyama's passing. Hence, there is a possibility that Toei wanted to include one final tribute in the anime, using each of these unique characters once apiece. What's Next For Dragon Ball After Daima's Ending? As of now, there is no official confirmation regarding upcoming projects related to the franchise. Dragon Ball Daima's post-credit scene left room for the story to develop later on. Unexpectedly, the third eye, which granted immense power to the previous Demon Kings, wasn't a unique item, as there are two more available at a mysterious store selling strange, status-altering consumables called medi-bugs, sky seeds, etc. There was no explanation about where the eyes come from and why they grant someone that much power. Even so, the ending was wholesome, and there's no guarantee that there will be a sequel. Furthermore, Dragon Ball Super is still on indefinite hiatus, even though it released a single chapter in February 2025. The series went on hiatus in March 2024, the same month Toriyama died. Toyotaro, the author of the spin-off manga Dragon Ball Heroes: Victory Mission and the illustrator of Dragon Ball Super, will be taking the helm as he will now be working on both the story and art. However, it's still unclear when the manga will return to its usual schedule. Dragon Ball is one of the most iconic anime and manga franchises in history, so Toei and Shonen Jump won't let it end with Daima.

Josh Allen passed for two touchdowns and rushed for two more and the visiting Buffalo Bills halted Detroit's franchise-record 11-game winning streak with a 48-42 victory over the Lions on Sunday. Allen, who has 10 total touchdowns in the last two games, passed for 362 yards and rushed for 68 yards. James Cook rushed for 105 yards and two touchdowns for the Bills (11-3). Jared Goff passed for 494 yards and matched his career high of five touchdowns for the Lions (12-2). Amon Ra St. Brown caught a touchdown while establishing career bests of 14 passes for 193 yards. The teams combined for 1,080 yards. Buffalo had 559, Detroit totaled 521. The Bills led 21-14 at halftime. Buffalo scored on its first possession, driving 73 yards. Allen then plunged in from a yard out for the touchdown. The next Bills possession began with a 28-yard pass from Allen to Cook. The 78-yard drive ended with a 4-yard run by Allen. Detroit answered with a 70-yard drive that Goff completed with a 12-yard scoring pass to Tim Patrick. The Bills made it 21-7 on Cook's 6-yard run. Detroit pulled within a touchdown again on a tackle-eligible play, as Goff connected with Dan Skipper on a 9-yard scoring pass. The Bills extended the advantage to 28-14 less than two minutes into the second half on Cook's 41-yard run. Following a St. Brown fumble in Lions territory, the Bills scored again. Allen threw a shovel pass to Khalil Shakir for a 3-yard touchdown with 3:31 left in the third quarter. The Lions answered before the quarter ended as St. Brown caught a pass from Goff near midfield and raced into the end zone on a 66-yard play. Tyler Bass kicked a 50-yard field goal in the first minute of the fourth quarter to make it 38-21. Goff's 12-yard TD pass to Jahmyr Gibbs with 12 minutes left cut Buffalo's lead to 10. A Detroit onside kick backfired as Mack Hollins returned it 37 yards to the 5. Allen tossed a scoring pass to Ray Davis on the next play. Gibbs scored on a 1-yard run with 8:02 left. Bass made a 41-yard field goal with 2:03 remaining for the 48-35 lead.

Nikola Jokic tormented the Washington Wizards three months ago and his impressive effort didn't even result in a victory. Because his career-high 56 points ended in defeat, Jokic figures to pack plenty of motivation when the Denver Nuggets host the Wizards on Saturday night. Jokic made 22 of 39 field-goal attempts and collected 16 rebounds and eight assists but his one-man domination ended with a 122-113 setback on Dec. 7. Jokic's scoring effort was the second best in Nuggets history behind David Thompson's memorable 73-point outing on the final day of the 1977-78 season. Thompson was bidding for the scoring title but finished second because George Gervin scored 63 for the San Antonio Spurs later that day. Nothing major like that was at stake but lowly Washington was thrilled with the outcome. Jordan Poole made a career-best nine 3-pointers and scored 39 points in the contest as the Wizards snapped a six-game skid in the series. Nuggets coach Michael Malone hasn't forgotten what happened in D.C. They already beat us, Malone said after Friday's victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. Even if we won by 40 or lost by 40, Washington already beat us. If there's any, 'Oh, we got these guys,' – that's what we thought last time and they beat us. When you're playing against a team that has already beaten you, that should be all the attention you need going into the game, in my opinion. Washington rested Friday night in Denver while the Nuggets (43-24) were fighting off the Lakers for a 131-126 home victory. The score was tied at 126 when Jamal Murray buried a 3-pointer with 5.6 seconds left. Murray had 26 points. Jokic scored 28 points and Christian Braun added 22. Malone was displeased with the contest against a shorthanded Los Angeles team missing LeBron James and Luka Doncic, among others. This isn't a beauty pageant, Malone said. We don't get rated on our wins. It's a win. One thing that bothered Malone was that Jokic and Murray only took 16 shots apiece. I got to get those two guys 20 to 25 shots per game, easy, Malone said. That's no disrespect to anybody else. We need those guys to carry the offensive load. Saturday's contest will be Denver's fifth in seven nights. League-worst Washington (14-51) has played well lately by going 5-4 over its last nine games. The Wizards split a two-game series in Detroit, taking the latter one 129-125 on Thursday. Washington outscored the Pistons 33-24 in the final quarter. Guys just stepped up, Washington coach Brian Keefe said. Everybody was supporting each other. Whoever is out there, got it done. … Guys stepped up when their opportunity was there. It's great. Seven Wizards scored between 14 and 19 points in a truly balanced effort. Alex Sarr had team highs of 19 points and four blocked shots and he also scored the go-ahead dunk with 53.6 seconds to play. Poole and Justin Champagnie scored 17 points apiece and Khris Middleton and Bub Carrington each added 16. Marcus Smart had 15 points and Corey Kispert added 14. Carrington said Tuesday's 123-103 loss to the Pistons was a motivating factor. It's a mix of discipline and individual pride, Carrington said. We knew we had to keep our intensity.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/nikola-jokic-nuggets-have-motivation-against-lowly-wizards/

Measles outbreaks in West Texas and New Mexico are now up to nearly 300 cases, and two unvaccinated people have died from measles-related causes. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that's airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and has been considered eliminated from the U.S. since 2000. As of Friday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its count of confirmed measles cases in the U.S. surpassed 2024. Here's what else you need to know about measles in the U.S. How many measles cases are there in Texas and New Mexico? Texas state health officials said Friday there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing Texas' total to 259. Five more people were hospitalized, for a total of 34. The outbreak has spread to two new counties: Cochran in West Texas with six and Lamar in the northeast part of the state with four. New Mexico health officials announced two new cases Friday, bringing the state's total to 35. Most of the cases are in Lea County, where two people are hospitalized. Eddy County has two cases. Oklahoma's state health department reported two probable cases of measles Tuesday, saying they are associated with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks. A school-age child died of measles in Texas last month, and New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult last week. Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.? Measles cases have been reported in Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases - and there have been three clusters that qualified as outbreaks in 2025. In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are generally traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles. Do you need an MMR booster? The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old. People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions. Adults with presumptive evidence of immunity generally don't need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally. A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don't always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary. Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don't need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from killed virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don't know which type they got. What are the symptoms of measles? Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash. The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC. Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death. How can you treat measles? There's no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable. Why do vaccination rates matter? In communities with high vaccination rates - above 95% - diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called herd immunity. But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots. The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.|2025-03-16|https://abc7chicago.com/post/measles-cases-reach-300-total-texas-new-mexico-heres-what-should-know/16028995/
ROME/ISTANBUL Italy will work to define effective security guarantees for Ukraine, but its participation in a possible military force deployed in the country is not planned, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said in a statement on Saturday. Meloni participated in a video conference meeting organized by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss commitments for a just and lasting peace that can ensure the future sovereignty and security of Ukraine. Meloni confirmed that Italy intends to continue working with European and Western partners and the United States to define credible and effective security guarantees, reaffirming however that Italy's participation in a possible military force on the ground is not planned, the readout said. Starmer said allies were stepping up preparations to support Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia.

Got a security roll-out plan for the next few years? Escalate it. Thinking about recruiting more security engineers? Start hiring. Looking for the right time to patch vulnerabilities and refresh passwords? Now's the time. The Ukraine conflict may feel far away to some of you, but the risk of your network being caught in the crossfire is increasing. Ukraine's relationship with NATO News reports say that a shooting war is beginning on the Russia/Ukraine border. To understand how this conflict may escalate outside the Baltic region, it's important to understand Ukraine's relationship with NATO. NATO member states have a series of obligations they have agreed upon, most notably a mutual protection pact. Ukraine, while not a NATO member, is considered a NATO partner. The NATO document, Relations with Ukraine, provides important insights into how NATO will interpret hostilities towards Ukraine: NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. Right now, that full support doesn't include sending troops up against Russian forces. In fact, NATO's position is more denunciation than outright hostility. The members state, The Allies strongly condemn and will not recognise Russia's illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation. Fundamentally, the NATO allies can't ignore Russia's actions. And while nobody wants World War III, NATO likely isn't going to sit this thing out. Enter cyberwar. Russia and cyberwar Russia's hacking activities have been making news for years: While not all these activities can be traced directly back to government operatives, there's almost always a government link somewhere in the chain. Next, let's look at how much the global IT industry has accepted Russian companies as full partners. At the top of the list is Kaspersky. Statista lists Kaspersky as the fourth largest (in terms of market share) anti-malware vendor for Windows machines. Kaspersky has long been fighting allegations of being cozy with the Russian government but there is a case for why the connection is under scrutiny. If Russia wanted to attack the west, it's got a ready-made channel to do so: the anti-malware software designed to defend against just that risk. Keep in mind that Russian developers have built a lot of the code we incorporate into our projects. Normally, that wouldn't cause any more worry than working with any other developer. But if Russia suddenly takes an adversarial position with NATO allies, the Russian coders we've been working with may suddenly turn into enemy combatants. In 2020, Russia's IT outsourcing market hit $6.75 billion, according to a report from IDC in ComputerWeekly. Outsourcing is the process of assigning IT operations to other organizations, so the client company doesn't have to do the work. Unfortunately, outsourcing also assigns control of IT operations to the vendor organization. If Russia turns into an adversarial actor, the control ceded by western companies to Russian outsourcing operations may well be the equivalent of giving all their passwords and authentication codes to the Russian government. So let's sum up the risk: In general, working with our fellow IT professionals in Russia can be a productive and positive experience. But if they suddenly turn to the dark side of the force due to this war, western IT security could be badly exposed. Prepare your networks Russia already has a history of attacking and breaching western companies and networks, and even tampering with elections. How bad will it get if there's a shooting war between Russia and Ukraine and a rhetoric war between NATO and Russia? Most likely, both sides -- who don't want to chance a nuclear conflagration -- will lob soft attacks at each other. We can expect propaganda attacks through social media, designed to give western populations a false view of the issues of the day. According to the FBI, Russian misinformation has been an ongoing problem. And then there's cyberwar. Expect both sides to launch attacks against each other. Cyberattacks have some degree of plausible deniability, they're sometimes hard to trace, it's difficult to point to rubble and bodies on the news, but the damage they do is still considerable. If the situation on the Russia/Ukraine border escalates, expect Russia to launch cyberattacks. They won't necessarily be visible attacks, either. Distributed denial of service attacks are messy, but they're like active sonar -- you can tell when you've been pinged. Advanced persistent threats, on the other hand, are stealthy. They dig into your networks and camp out. Sometimes they exfiltrate information. Sometimes they modify information. Sometimes, they break things. APTs have been known to enter a network and live there for months and even years. These attacks aren't just going to be limited to government networks. They'll target networks all across NATO economies, possibly even yours. When that attack hits, you're suddenly in the line of fire. If you're one of the many IT pros who read ZDNet, mitigating that attack is your responsibility. And that's why, due to a war halfway around the globe, there's a chance your network will be a target. Stay vigilant If you outsource to a Russian IT vendor or use Russian-based security software, it might be time to evaluate your potential risk level. We can't automatically assume that Russian vendors will give up their market advantage to support a war, but you'll need to watch those relationships with great care. If your vendors suddenly seem to change attitude or personality, pay attention. And make sure you have a failover plan in place with alternative vendors. I know you have other priorities. We always do. But here's the thing. Any network manager stands a good chance of being in the line of fire for a cyberwar with Russia. If this thing goes long or escalates, it will no longer be a matter of if, but when.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-avoid-being-unwillingly-drafted-as-a-cyber-combatant-in-the-russia-ukraine-war/

Federal officials marked International Day to Combat Islamophobia Saturday by calling on Canadians to push back against bigotry directed at the country's Muslim communities. But one organization that defends the civil rights of Canada's Muslim says not enough is being done to counter the rising tide of hate. Amira Elghawaby, Canada's Special Representative on Combatting Islamophobia, issued a statement Saturday, saying Muslims in Canada face systemic barriers and are subjected to violence and discrimination. Islamophobia, she added, comes in the form of racism, stereotypes and hostility. In addition to individual acts of intolerance and racial proﬁling, Islamophobia can unfairly lead to viewing and treating Muslims as a greater security threat on an institutional and societal level, she said. Elghawaby touted actions the federal government has taken to tackle islamophobia, saying Ottawa has stepped up support for the Canada Community Security Program and Canada's Anti-Racism Strategy. Gov.-Gen. Mary Simon issued a statement of her own Saturday, asking Canadians to resist engaging in bigotry. From harassment to hateful words online, the recent rise in hostility against Muslims is not only unacceptable and devastating for the victims and their families, but it also undermines our strength as a country, Simon said. But the Canadian Muslim Forum says there needs to be more action than words. In an interview Saturday, Samer Majzoub, the group's president, said Ottawa should implement stronger hate speech (laws) and stronger interventions. The forum is also demanding that federal and provincial governments boost funding for security measures at mosques, educate people in schools and workplaces about Islamophobia and remove systemic discriminations from government institutions. Majzoub points to Bill 21 — Quebec's secularism law, which bans public employees like teachers and police officers from wearing religious symbols on the job — as one example of what he feels is discrimination enshrined in law. In January, the Supreme Court of Canada announced it will hear a legal challenge of Bill 21 brought by several groups that oppose the law. The federal government has filed a notice to intervene in that case in defence of freedom of religion.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/03/15/canadian-officials-muslim-leaders-call-for-action-against-islamophobia/
/ no-photos-1500x632 - Advertisement - My Wife Doesn't Know… 15th June 2006 By Susan Noyce Past Profiles: Living with HIV/AIDS John Doe #1 My Wife Doesn't Know… 15th June 2006 By Susan Noyce The first two profiles were from women on opposite ends of the spectrum living with HIV. Today we meet John Doe, number one, who is deeply submerged in what some commonly call the down-low culture. His wife knows neither his lifestyle nor his status. This is a true story, and we tell it so that people can understand that HIV AIDS is everybody's business. As we've said before on our editorial page, in this community we are either infected or affected. John Doe #1 I'm married, I'm a father, I'm bisexual, and most of all, I'm HIV positive. My wife does not know I'm bisexual, and she doesn't know I'm HIV positive. I've been bisexual for quite some time now, and I've known that I'm HIV positive about a year or so now. I found out from my male partner that his ex-male partner was diagnosed with the disease. We both got tested, and both of our results returned positive also. When I heard the news, the only thing I could say was, oh God, I'm dead now. Not knowing is one thing, but when you know and you can't tell that person, it's double jeopardy. My wife, how would she take it if she found out? I would not just have to tell her I'm HIV positive, but also that I had it from a man. She's such a good person. She stood behind me through bad times and good times. She believes in me. No one would even believe that I'm HIV positive, and me going with a man would be a shocker. My wife and I don't use condoms or any kind of other protection. She's always thought I'm faithful. After I found out I was HIV positive, the feeling of having sex with my wife wasn't there. Neither were there any feelings to be with my male partner. Whenever my wife and I have sex, since I found out, I feel like I am killing her over and over again. Each day I see her, I feel so guilty. There are hardly any words to describe exactly how I feel. Also, when I play with my youngest child, I wonder if I will live to see him become an adult. When my wife wants to make love, a cold, frightening feeling runs through my body. All I do is go through the motions, or sometimes I just tell her I am tired. She understands my tiredness because of the work I do. I usually have to work long hours. I'm living a great big lie. I don't know how to let my wife know. I know she will eventually find out one of these days. I know she'll kill me if she found out, and if she finds out she's HIV positive, it will lead right back to me. My male partner and I don't have a relationship anymore. We both came to an understanding. He hasn't told his wife. He hasn't told his wife because he doesn't know how to do so either. We are both well-respected persons. We both thought that because we only were going with our wives and each other, there was nothing to fear. I sometimes feel as if I am on the edge of crossing the line from sane to insane because my guilt is extremely overwhelming. We didn't get tested here, so no one here knows our secret, and I just don't know what to do. I sometimes feel as though God has forsaken me because of what I have done. I know I don't have a choice. It's either I tell her now, or somehow she will find out. I believe she's also HIV positive, and my partner thinks his wife is also. I'm supposed to be a man of strength and courage, but now I feel like a wimp. Sometimes I try to think of what the outcome will be. I try not to think of what the outcome will be. I'm always thinking each day is the day to tell her HIV AIDS does not discriminate. Cheating on your partner, whether she is a man or a woman, has its consequences. I know if I start to use a condom, my wife will become suspicious. I'm very, very desperate, for I am damned if I do tell her, and I am damned if I don't.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/profiles-living-with-hiv-aids-john-doe-1/
PEMBROKE — Another month has passed with no foresable movement on legislation that would provide full federal legitacy to the Lumbee Nation, which has for more than a century seen nothing but lip service from the American government. The question of who gets to claim the title of American Indian is at the center of a fight over potential federal recognition for the indigenous Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. With a claimed membership of 60,000 people concentrated in and around Robeson County, the Lumbe people continue their fight for the benefits given to other American Indians. Those perks include health care funding, housing programs and, of course, the opportunity to establish casinos. A bipartisan coalition of lawmakers have supported bills to grant federal recognition the past few congressional cycles, but up to this point none have made it all the way to the president's desk to be signed into law. That may soon change. 'An issue of fairness' During his first week in office, President Donald Trump made good on his campaign promise to support the Lumbee cause with a memo to the Department of the Interior directing them to draft a plan to grant full federal recognition. The Lumbee tribe has been wrongfully denied federal recognition for more than a century, Trump told a crowd during a campaign stop in North Carolina in September. Speaking at the Aero Center near North Carolina's Wilmington International Airport, Trump addressed a crowd of supporters. Today I am officially announcing that if I am elected in November, I will sign legislation granting the great Lumbee Tribe the federal recognition that it deserves. The Lumbee Tribe has been wrongfully denied federal recognition for more than a century, Trump said. But now we're going to take care of it. We'll take care of it right at the beginning. Once completed, the directive will reverse a 1956 law that acknowledged the tribe as the Lumbee Indians of North Carolina, but denied them federal benefits that typically come with that recognition. A note: Both the state and federal government, and many tribes themselves, use the term American Indian to refer to the indigenous people living in the United States. Lumbee Chairman John Lowery spent a week in Washington, D.C. last month as consultations for the carrying out of the president's memorandum began. Lowery told Carolina Public Press he left the U.S. capital feeling cautiously optimistic about finally achieving full federal recognition. We have very strong support from both sides of the aisle, Lowery said. At the end of the day, whether Democrat or Republican, individuals understand that this is an issue of fairness. It's also an issue that is somewhat complicated. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, the only federally-recognized tribe in the state, vehemently oppose granting the Lumbee the same status through congressional action rather than the typical application process carried out by the Department of the Interior. In fact, Cherokee opposition to Lumbee recognition dates back to at least 1910. Principal Chief Michell Hicks, the leader of the Eastern Band, told CPP that such a move would be a slippery slope that encourages illegitimate tribal groups to falsely claim federal benefits. It is a dangerous decision that will open up the floodgates to others wanting to do the same thing, he said. Lumbee lineage holds the key The Cherokee are an indigenous people who once populated parts of what is now North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama. They had long been a sovereign nation with their own government prior to European colonization of the region. Today, the Eastern Band is one of three federally-recognized Cherokee tribes and the only one not located in Oklahoma. They are descendants of a small group of Cherokee people who remained in North Carolina after the U.S. government forcibly relocated them to reservations in the 1830s. By the mid-1900s, the Eastern Band had organized into its own tribal nation fully acknowledged by the federal government. More than 16,000 Cherokee people live and work on their reservation lands which stretch across Swain, Jackson, Cherokee and Graham counties near the western tip of the state. The Lumbee, on the other hand, have a history that is less cohesive. Their story is one of mixed cultures and ambiguous identity. Even the name Lumbee is a modern construction, thought to have originated in the 1950s from the Lumber River that flows through the tribe's claimed territory. Since the 1880s, the group has petitioned Congress for federal recognition under names such as Cherokee Indians of Robeson County and Croatan Indians — a reference to a once-popular theory that they were descended from European settlers of The Lost Colony and nearby indigenous people. Later research on the origin of the Lumbee suggests they are descended from a mix of people with indigenous, European and African heritage. That lineage matters because the federal acknowledgement process requires petitioners to prove they are descended from a historical Indian tribe or a combination of historical tribes that function as one political entity. The historical tribe requirement has proven to be an obstacle for the Lumbee since the U.S. government confirmed their eligibility to apply for federal acknowledgement in 2016. Still, Lowery said his tribe's indeterminate origins shouldn't be disqualifying. They've long inhabited the sandhills and enjoyed a good relationship with the state. The time has come for the Lumbee to be recognized by a government that has consistently overlooked them. The fact that we are still here centuries after colonial expansion, centuries after war and disease, he said, should be celebrated. Membership has its privileges Hicks said he supports the Lumbee's right to go through the federal acknowledgement process, but opposes any congressional action that would allow them to circumvent that procedure. It's a matter of protecting their own cultural identity, Hicks explained, pointing to hundreds of groups claiming to be Cherokee tribes. There is this merits-based process that was established because of the need to really dive into the claims of any group, he said. Some proponents of Lumbee recognition dismiss that argument. They say that the Cherokee simply want to protect their stake in the gaming industry, which legally can only take place on native lands. A few years ago the tribe fought and lost a legal battle with the Catawba Indian Nation — a federally-recognized tribe in South Carolina — who planned to build a competing casino outside of Charlotte. If the Lumbee were to become federally recognized, they might be another competitor in the high-stakes casino business. However, both Lowery and Hicks downplayed the potential of a Lumbee-run casino as a reason for their political feud. The Lumbee opening a casino in a different region is unlikely to impact (our) gaming operations and is not the basis of our opposition, Hicks said in a statement. However, the fact that the Lumbee could establish an Indian gaming facility without even being able to specify which tribe they descend from illustrates the broader stakes for communities across America. If federal recognition is granted without requiring verifiable historical evidence, any group claiming to be a tribe could gain recognition — and with it, the ability to open a casino in any town in America. Meanwhile, Lumbee leaders in state government have lambasted Hicks and the Eastern Band for their superiority complex since discussion about recognition once again started to heat up. A December letter penned by N.C. Commission of Indian Affairs chairman Ricky Burnett, a member of the Lumbee Tribe, censured Hicks for statements made by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians that question the legitimacy of other tribal nations. These actions reflect a troubling pattern of behavior in which the (Eastern Band) has positioned itself as an oppressor toward fellow tribes in North Carolina and neighboring states, according to the letter. Hicks said he was offended by the accusations. I don't think it's the position of any commission to basically take a political stance against the only federally-recognized tribe and the largest tribe east of the Mississippi, he said. Soon after, state Rep. Jarrod Lowery, the brother of the Lumbee chairman and the only Native American legislator in the General Assembly, criticized Gov. Josh Stein for appointing Hicks to his administration's transition team. The Republican legislator from Robeson County also introduced a bill last month that would redistribute money from an education fund composed primarily from the Eastern Band's gaming revenues to the seven other state-recognized tribes.|2025-03-16|https://www.robesonian.com/news/315600/time-has-come-for-full-recognition
Two things in life are certain, according to Ben Franklin: death and taxes. In Colorado Springs, residents face a third certainty: roadwork. Over the next decade, residents will likely notice even more of it on the streets where they live, under the third iteration of a voter-approved sales and use tax that funds local road repairs and maintenance. Since voters first authorized the 2C tax in the fall of 2015, the city has paved nearly 1,800 lane miles, repaired almost 300 miles of curb and gutter — plus 4.3 million square feet of sidewalk, and has built or improved more than 10,000 pedestrian ramps, city data shows as of December 2024. Operations and Maintenance Division Manager Corey Farkas said 90% of the next iteration of 2C, for road repairs and maintenance between 2026 and 2035, will focus on residential roadways. Former Mayor John Suthers remains supportive of the hard-fought tax he helped put in front of voters in 2015. In an interview with The Gazette, Suthers said residential streets have been long neglected, with sections on the west side of the city remaining untouched for nearly half a century. To their credit, voters have extended the tax twice: first in 2019 for an additional five years, which ends Dec. 31, 2025, and most recently in November of 2024 for an additional 10 years. The 0.57% sales and use tax amounts to 5.7 cents for every $10 purchase, with few exemptions. Some residents, though, have shared concerns that Colorado Springs is spending too much on 2C projects, is spending the money on unauthorized uses, or that they're not seeing the improvements in their neighborhoods. What's happened so far Farkas said the first five-year period of the tax, from 2016 to 2020 focused on getting the best bang for the citizen's buck by prioritizing larger roadways like Union and Academy boulevards and Woodmen and Garden of the Gods roads. Around 400 segments of roadway were improved. If we went into residential areas in year one, the people that live there and maybe the people who visit them would see benefits from those new streets, Farkas said. But if we go to these arterial roads, everybody (will see benefits.) In its second iteration, the current tax that funds roadwork from 2021 to 2025, the city concentrated on finishing the arterial roads and started work on collector streets, or secondary roadways that connect residential roads to arterial roadways, Farkas said. In this iteration, the city is improving around 850 shorter segments. 'A robust quality of life' Beginning next year, through 2035, the city plans to focus on more than 1,200 road segments, most of them in residential areas. Former Mayor Suthers, Mayor Yemi Mobolade and other supporters have touted the tax as necessary to keep Colorado Springs roads in tip-top shape. It is easier and less costly, they've said, to keep roads maintained than it is to completely rebuild aging ones that have fallen into disrepair. This proven program means smoother, safer roads to work, schools, hospitals, military installations, your favorite restaurants and our homes, Mobolade said in a statement after voters extended the tax a third time in November. A robust quality of life depends on strong infrastructure. And the data is positive. With 2C and other regional funding, such as the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority tax that funds regional capital and road maintenance projects, vehicle damage claims submitted to the city decreased 79% from 2015 to 2023, according to city data. Nearly 550 claims were filed in 2015, compared with 117 filed in 2023. Pothole claims specifically saw a 34% decrease since 2015, according to the city. In 2015, almost 8,500 complaints were recorded. By 2023, the number of complaints had dropped to a little over 5,600. Residents express concerns Despite voter support for 2C, however, some people have raised concerns about the program in the last 10 years, Colorado Springs resident Jim Godfrey said. Godfrey sits on the 2C advisory board that collaborates with Public Works to prioritize 2C projects, implement road improvements and keep the public informed about the work. One concern brought up by Colorado Springs residents lately is the fear the city is overspending on 2C projects or using the funds for other non-infrastructure projects. ...We should do an audit of where all the money has gone so far, Instagram user madapostle wrote on a Gazette social media post seeking readers' feedback on 2C. I have no problem paying higher (taxes) here and there to be able to take care of things in the city, but not if it's not going where it's supposed to. Godfrey offered reassurance, saying the tax money is put into a checking account of sorts, meaning the city can't spend more than it has. It's not mingled in with other city budgets, Godfrey said. Any balance that's left over when we finish up for the year just rolls over into the next. The Colorado Springs city auditor completes an audit of 2C funding annually and publishes each report on the city's website. A widespread concern is that residents aren't seeing improvements near them, or that improvements are primarily on gutters, sidewalks and ramps rather than roadways. Featured Local Savings If they were actually fixing the roads I wouldn't mind, but all I've seen is curb work, Facebook user Christine Thompson wrote on a Gazette post. I have to get my car aligned all the time because of potholes. Farkas said the federal government does not consider a mill and overlay a maintenance application, but rather a road alteration. By law, anytime a roadway is altered, all pedestrian ramps must be brought to current federal standards. Repairs on curbs and gutters are intended to keep the road in good condition longer. Through the cracks in the concrete, you get water infiltration underneath your brand-new roadway and you're going to have a premature failure in your roadway that you've just put down, Farkas said. Residential streets differ from main and connector roads in that they have more miles of sidewalks and gutters, as well as more pedestrian ramps. While the difference between the average overlay costs per mile for residential and arterial streets only differs by a little more than $150, concrete cost differs drastically per mile of centerline roadway. According to the city, concrete costs per mile on residential streets sit around $1.2 million on average, a significant increase from the average cost of around $989,230 per mile for arterial roads. We hear a lot of good things, and we do hear from folks that 'they're not paving near me,' Farkas said. Our paving has been spread equitably across all six of the city council districts within — plus or minus 2% — and that's all based on the infrastructure that's within that particular district. A misconception regarding 2C, according to Farkas, is that the tax is intended for potholes when, in fact, pothole repairs are funded through the city budget. Formed by the rapid freeze-thaw cycle that also contributes to extending cracks, potholes are a symptom of a sick road according to Farkas. While they do impact the Overall Condition Index — the rating system used to evaluate the quality of city streets — they aren't the only factor in determining which roads are fixed and when through 2C. A second significant road tax The 2C tax brings in roughly $50 million a year to repair exclusively city roads, but that's not the only funding the overall region, including the city, obtains for transportation infrastructure. Roughly $150 million a year comes from the Pikes Peak Rural Transportation Authority's one-cent sales tax which aims to maintain aging infrastructure like roads, bridges and drainage systems in Colorado Springs, unincorporated El Paso County, Manitou Springs and the towns of Green Mountain Falls, Ramah and Calhan. According to county engineer Josh Palmer, roughly 70% of the annual PPRTA funds go to the city. Just under 29% goes to El Paso County, with the remaining balance spread out between the other districts, based on population. Colorado Springs receives between $104 to $105 million, with about $60 million going to capital improvements and around $37 million going to road maintenance, according to City Engineer Gayle Sturdivant. The maintenance portion helps fund some roadway improvements like 2C does, but about 40% of those funds are dedicated toward bridges. Other areas of focus for PPRTA funds include traffic signals and ADA-compliant concrete work. El Paso County is typically allocated to spend $20 million a year for capital improvements. Around $15 million goes toward infrastructure maintenance similar to the ones 2C focuses on. Our biggest concern really is that for the longest time, the county has just been kind of reactive, county engineer Palmer said. The establishment of PPRTA in 2004, $10 million in federal American Rescue Act funding earmarked specifically for roads and an increased level of support from county leadership has helped the county get back in the game, Palmer said. Fortunately, the last couple years we've been able to make some progress, so we can start doing some better planning, Palmer said. It's not like it was willful neglect. It was just the lack of resources. El Paso County will do a complete road assessment this spring — just like it did in 2022 — to help determine how to tackle the improvements while optimizing spending to allow for more repairs. The PPRTA tax has been approved multiple times, the last time being in 2022 for an extension of the capital portion through 2034. In combination with 2C, city and county officials say local roads will only continue to improve. If you think our roads are bad, you should have been here in 2015 when the roads were absolutely horrible, Farkas said. Now I drive around our city with a smile on my face. Suthers said he anticipates the tax will need to remain in place for a long time — so long as voters continue to approve it. He said that while great strides have been made, especially comparing current roads to 2015 conditions, the work is ongoing. We were grossly underfunded for regular maintenance and improvement and 2C brought us into the ballpark of proper funding, Suthers said. If we do not continue (2C), the deterioration would be very quick — you've just got to stay on top of it.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/news/10-more-years-of-2c-road-tax-this-time-maybe-in-your-neighborhood/article_34b1a9e0-e64e-11ef-8c25-9705dc3069cc.html

/ Twenty-six Caribbean women match officials complete three-day groundbreaking course. - Advertisement - Hopeful, energized, grateful, motivated, and inspired were just some of the sentiments expressed on Sunday evening by the participants as 26 match officials from across the Caribbean completed an inaugural course strictly for women. The Antigua and Barbuda Football Association (ABFA) hosted the three-day initiative, which FIFA, Concacaf, and UN Women MCO-Caribbean supported. The capacity-building course provided high-level training and was pitched primarily at match officials on the FIFA list. In addition to the customary topics, the course explored the evolution of Caribbean women match officials and celebrated their progress. Seven emerging referees from the host country were also invited, exemplifying the CFU's commitment to developing new talent. Days one and three were comprised of intense fitness and technical sessions. Day two, International Women's Day, focused on interactive enrichment sessions. The sessions included a panel discussion with Jassett Kerr-Wilson, Stephanie Dale Yee Sing, and Mijensa Rensch, moderated by attorney Gail Christian. Trailblazing astronaut and personal coach Keisha Schahaff led a wellness session; history-making rower Kevinia Francis, a black belt karateka, and Purple Dragon Sensei Jahmooza Francis delivered a lesson on self-defense. The group explored Social Media and Branding with Yorie Taylor, Equity and Equality with Planning and Coordination Specialist with UN Women MCO-Caribbean Akilah Dorris, and Professionalism with Carlene Spencer. Victor Stewart explored the evolution of the Caribbean woman match official. Stewart recognized match officials from yesteryear and the current crop, and the match officials received his presentation with respect bordering reverence for the Caribbean pioneers, A highlight of the day was the presentation of Excellence Exemplified awards to match officials with international appointments. The awardees were Mijensa Rensch (Suriname), Melissa Nicholas (Trinidad and Tobago), Stephanie Dale Yee Sing (Jamaica), Jassett Kerr-Wilson (Jamaica), Vimarest Diaz (Dominican Republic), Dianne Ferreira-James (Guyana), and Kelesha Antoine (Antigua and Barbuda). There were also awards for Odette Hamilton (Jamaica), Ivett Santiago (Cuba), Crystal Sobers (Trinidad and Tobago), and Carissa Douglas (Trinidad and Tobago), who were unavoidably absent. FIFA Regional Development Officer Javier Santos noted FIFA's commitment to women. He told the match officials that opportunities exist and reiterated support for each CFU Member Association and the match officials. Antoine, who is also a member of the CFU and Concacaf Referee Committees and Head of Refereeing Antigua and Barbuda, said the inaugural course was necessary to celebrate the hard work of women match officials in the region, past, present and emerging. ABFA Acting President Gwendolyn Salmon, also a member of the CFU Executive Committee, said she had no reservations in hosting the course as she recognized the significant impact it would have on the participants. Salmon commended the match officials for their dedication and representing their Member Associations and the Caribbean well whenever they are appointed to games. She told the participants that she looks forward to seeing their continued ascendency on the regional and global stage. The course instructors were Antoine, a FIFA Referee Fitness Instructor, FIFA Technical Instructor Dianne Ferreira-James, Refereeing Technical Appointments Coordinator Concacaf Carolina Briones, Concacaf Technical Instructor Ishan Philip, Instructor/admin Victor Stewart, and Santos.

In fact, many of the cars you laud for Japanese reliability or European build quality are likely assembled elsewhere. With that in mind, let's breakdown where Australia's best-selling vehicles are actually produced. Ford Ranger Australia's favourite vehicle is manufactured in a variety of different locations, including South Africa, Argentina, and the United States, depending on the market in which the Ranger is sold. Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made However, the main production hub resides in Rayong, Thailand. Ford's Thai manufacturing plant produces Ranger models for the Asia-Pacific, Australia, and Europe, as well as parts of Africa and the Middle East. Among the Ranger vehicles built at the Rayong production facility is the Raptor flagship. However, the upcoming Ranger PHEV will come here from Ford's Silverton plant in Pretoria, South Africa, where the Volkswagen Amarok is also exclusively produced. Ford Australia sold a total of 62,593 Rangers in 2024 – making it the first Blue Oval model since the EB and ED Falcon (1992/93) to claim back-to-back national sales victories. Designed and developed in Australia alongside its Everest SUV sibling, the latest generation Ranger was released in 2022 and is offered in a wide variety of body styles and (so far) four powertrains, including single- and twin-turbo 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesels and a 3.0-litre V6 turbo-diesel.

The Newcomb mansion, built in 1859 at 118 West Broadway by architect Henry Whitestone. (Courtesy Steve Wiser) In two Louisville-area parks sit small remnants of our community's past that most thought had been lost forever. Nestled among the trees at a side entrance into Cherokee Park, two stone gateposts look like they've been there forever. At the Alta nature trail head (Cherokee Road and Alta Avenue intersection) in Cherokee Park, those posts have a much longer history that predates the Olmsted masterpiece by decades. Closer in at Memorial Park (Fourth and Kentucky streets), more identical stone gateposts stand as ornaments within the modern park design. Both of these garden follies are from stand the original gate posts columns from the old St. Xavier High School once located on Broadway between First and Second streets. These four columns have a long and distinguished heritage. The Newcomb mansion, built in 1859 at 118 West Broadway by architect Henry Whitestone. (Courtesy Steve Wiser) / Horatio Newcomb. (Courtesy Steve Wiser) The old St. Xavier High School was originally the Newcomb mansion. Built in 1859 at 118 West Broadway, this residence was designed by the legendary Louisville architect Henry Whitestone (1819–1893). Whitestone was known for his Italianate Renaissance designs. Several of his buildings still survive today, including the old L&N Railroad building (131 West Main Street, now the Whiskey Row Lofts) and the Tompkins-Buchanan House (851 South Fourth Street, which is incorporated within another building at Spalding University.) Whitestone also designed the Landward building (formerly known as the Stuart Robinson residence at Fourth and Magnolia) and the Peterson-Dumesnil House at 301 South Peterson Avenue is attributed to him as well. Horatio Newcomb. (Courtesy Steve Wiser) / The Newcomb Mansion was expanded to accommodate St. Xavier. (Courtesy Steve Wiser / Animation by Broken Sidewalk) The mansion's original owner was Horatio Newcomb (1809–1874). Mr. Newcomb headed Newcomb, Buchanan & Company, a whiskey distillery, and served as president of the L&N Railroad, succeeding James Guthrie. He also was an organizer of the former Louisville Board of Trade (whose building was also designed by Whitestone). Between 1887 and 1891, the Louisville Female Seminary occupied the mansion prior to the Xaverian Brothers obtaining it in 1891. (St. Xavier was previously located where the Louisville Palace Theater now resides.) The Brothers altered the mansion by removing the classical stone facade and moving it toward Broadway, expanding the floor plan outwards. Wing additions were also built in brick and a third floor added to match the old house. But, the stone gate pillars remained where Whitestone placed them. The site as it appears today. See top photo for historic comparison. (Steve Wiser) / Interior views of the old St. Xavier High School.

They found a new home with Robert & Mary Adelberg, who donated them back to St X in 2003. The vases now sit on the campus, at the east entrance to the Media Center building, opposite the main entrance. They have been beautifully restored.

If these vases and pillars could tell tales of all the Louisvillians who have passed by, they would speak of the social elite who visited Horatio Newcomb and the students of St. Xavier High School. Several small bits of Louisville history, once forgotten, are still standing with pride.

WILKES-BARRE — The Shapiro Administration this week highlighted National Procurement Month by recognizing modernization achievements made by the Department of General Services (DGS), Bureau of Procurement (BOP) and agency procurement professionals in purchasing goods and services to support Pennsylvanians' needs every day. From the purchase of IT infrastructure and software that connects residents to medical care and social services, to the procurement of road salt used to clear snow-covered roads, procurement professionals work behind the scenes to ensure Pennsylvanians have full access to critical services, medicines, goods and job and business opportunities, Shapiro's office said. Making state government more approachable for all citizens has been a focus of the Shapiro-Davis Administration since day one, said DGS Secretary Reggie McNeil. DGS' ultimate goal of providing better services to the people of Pennsylvania is rooted in making the prospect of doing business with state agencies less intimidating and streamlining outdated and confusing processes. As the Commonwealth's central procurement bureau, BOP is responsible for the purchase of goods and services necessary for the safe and effective operations of the state, including securing vehicle contracts that allow Pennsylvania State Police to protect residents and park rangers to patrol state parks, purchasing life-saving medicines the Commonwealth provides to Pennsylvania's most vulnerable residents, securing contracts to staff medical facilities, delivering counseling services, and opening doors to an array of business opportunities. Meuser co-sponsors legislation to increase sanctions on Iran U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, this week co-sponsored H.R.1422 — the Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act of 2025. Meuser said this bipartisan legislation will strengthen existing sanctions against foreign entities that facilitate Iran's illicit oil trade — the Iranian regime's primary revenue stream. As Iran accelerates its nuclear program, Meuser said the Enhanced Iran Sanctions Act would apply maximum economic pressure to disrupt the Iranian regime's funding streams and counter its support for terrorism. Meuser said this legislation will impose new secondary sanctions on banks, financial institutions, insurers, flagging registries and companies involved in pipeline construction and liquefied natural gas operations to prevent foreign entities from helping Iran profit from illicit oil sales. The legislation requires the State Department to establish an Interagency Working Group on Iranian Sanctions. This group will work with allies through a multilateral contact group to enhance enforcement of sanctions. At its core, Meuser said this legislation sends a clear message: anyone propping up Iran's energy sector will be held accountable. Iran's illicit oil trade fuels its terrorist proxies and nuclear ambitions, threatening our national security and endangering our allies in the Middle East, Meuser said. This bill severs the financial lifelines propping up terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, holding accountable anyone who enables Iran's illegal oil trade. By imposing stronger sanctions, we can cut off Iran's oil revenues, weaken its nuclear pursuits, and enhance regional stability. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort to reinforce our national security and stand behind our allies, especially Israel. Meuser said sanctions on Iranian oil have historically been an effective tool in limiting the regime's financial resources and influence. He said during the first Trump Administration, strict sanctions were imposed, reducing Iran's foreign reserves to approximately $4 billion by the time President Trump left office. In contrast, Meuser said the subsequent lifting of many of these sanctions under the Biden Administration allowed Iran's reserves to grow to an estimated $90 billion, a significant portion of which was used to finance proxy terror in the region. H.R.1422 has been referred to the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committee for further consideration. Fetterman leads introduction of School Lunch Debt Cancellation Act U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Braddock, this week introduced legislation that would direct the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pay off all outstanding student meal debt. The legislation — the School Lunch Debt Cancellation Act — also would grant the USDA new authority to purchase food for food banks. 'School lunch debt' is a term so absurd that is shouldn't even exist, Fetterman said. We must protect students' access to healthy foods and stand with working families. There are more than 20 million children in the U.S. who can't afford their school meals, and the national public school meal debt is a whopping $176 million each year. In Pennsylvania alone, there are nearly half a million food insecure children who collectively owe nearly $234 million in total debt. AG joins coalition in proposal to end Google monopoly Attorney General Dave Sunday this week joined a bipartisan coalition of 38 state Attorneys General and the U.S. Justice Department in proposing a final package of resolutions to end Google's illegal monopoly over internet search engines and restore competition to the benefit of consumers nationwide. The resolutions regard Google's prevalence as the default search engine, most notably on Android and Apple devices. If approved, the proposal would prohibit Google from making payments to those companies to maintain their presence on Android and Apple devices. To 'Google' is used synonymously with searching for something online, and this coalition strongly believes that is due to monopolistic practices that have gone on for far too long, AG Sunday said. The package of solutions proposes a ban on all search-related payments from Google to distribution partners, including Apple and Android partners. A hearing on the proposed remedies is scheduled to begin April 21 and conclude by May 9.|2025-03-16|https://www.timesleader.com/news/1688566/capitol-roundup-pa-modernizes-procurement-process-to-create-opportunity-for-small-businesses

Scrapping NHS England is the beginning, not the end , the Health Secretary has said, vowing to continue slashing bloated bureaucracy . Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Wes Streeting suggested hundreds more quangos could be in the firing line after the Prime Minister announced the end of the body overseeing the health service in England. He said: The abolition of NHS England – the world's largest quango – is the beginning, not the end. Patients and staff alike can see the inefficiency and waste in the health service. My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy. NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it was established to cut down on political interference in the NHS – something Mr Streeting described as an act of backside-covering to avoid blame for failures. But on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the Government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid duplication . In his Sunday Telegraph article, Mr Streeting suggested more was to come, saying new NHS England chair Penny Dash had identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration . The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Mr Streeting, who in January of this year said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS. He told the Health Service Journal he could spend a hell of a lot of time on reorganisation and not make a single difference to the patient interest , saying instead he would focus on trying to eliminate waste and duplication . But in the Sunday Telegraph, he said he had heard former Conservative health ministers bemoan not abolishing NHS England, adding: If we hadn't acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn't have been possible. The Government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline services. But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.|2025-03-16|https://www.rutland-times.co.uk/national/more-quangos-could-be-in-firing-line-after-nhs-england-scrapped-streeting-141843/
In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The announcement from the White House came just hours after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the removal of five Venezuelan men for 14 days under the expected invocation of the act. An emergency hearing on the matter will take place Saturday evening. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://news.wgcu.org/2025-03-15/trump-enacts-a-1790s-law-to-target-alien-enemies-for-detention-and-deportation

Radmin also allows you to connect to public servers, however, the user experience is not as good as GameRanger. Network -- Enable this if you encounter problems connecting to other optimizations players. This can alleviate connectivity issues for all 3 online platforms. Since this option will reduce security settings in order to increase connectivity, you will be taking a risk and exposing your PC (just a little more) to the Internet. Use with caution. In short, when you enable network optimizations, your Windows will choose to prefer IPv4 over IPv6. This is useful because Generals and Zero Hour fail to connect to other players when IPv6 is used. Furthermore, your WiFi or ethernet network is set to be a 'private network', and GenPatcher also adds a firewall-entry for Generals, Zero Hour, and GameRanger. Disabling the network optimizations will only undo the changes that were applied by GenPatcher. GameRanger -- GameRanger automatically launches the game in full-screen window mode by default. However, switching to window mode can bring a number of benefits such as additional stability. Enabling this setting updates GameRanger to run your game in window when the game is launched. Hide IP from -- This may be useful for live-streamers who are game menus broadcasting their matches on live video platforms such as YouTube or Twitch. This setting will hide your local & public IP address to prevent viewers from seeing your IP addresses. 7. INSTALLATION INFO Here you can find crucial information about your game. You will be able to see which game installation type you have installed, the date of when the game was installed, as well as the version of your game. If your game installation is not supported, please find an alternative and legal way of installing the game. There are also clickable shortcut-style links to your game's installation directories (where the official game installer installed your game), and your game's 'Data' folders (where configuration files, maps and replays are held). 8. COMMAND-LINE LAUNCH PARAMETERS GenPatcher supports a number of command-line launch parameters. For a seamless experience, it's recommended to run your command-line terminal as administrator. -acceptpolicy -- Automatically accept the privacy policy without being shown the privacy policy popup. -autoclose -- Automatically close GenPatcher after a 'dump' or 'forceinstall' has completed successfully. -dump -- Generate a debug info dump as a dump.txt text file in GenPatcher's directory (Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data\GenPatcher). When used in combination with 'forceinstall', this will result in two dump files. One will be generated before any of the 'forceinstall' packages are applied, and one will be generated afterwards as well. -forceinstall -- Automatically force-install fixes or installation Note: Packages will not be handled in the order specified in the command-line parameters.

Let me start out by saying this, I absolutely adore Maine or I wouldn't choose to live here. We'd all be lying though if we tried to say it still feels like a vacationland during the colder months because it looks like this: Once summertime hits here, Maine beats out any state in the summer, but that's the exact reason our 'Vacationland' slogan isn't 1000 percent accurate in my opinion. Maine State Slogan Vacationland As most of us know, there's two iconic billboard signs off the highway that let you know you're in Maine. One says 'Vacationland' and the other says The Way Life Should Be . Everytime I pass the The Way Life Should Be sign, I agree but I also get angry the times I pass it while i'm barely holding on while driving in a snowstorm. Life absolutely shouldn't be like that. It should be like this: Gosh Maine is gorgeous in the summertime. THAT is the only time it's accurate to call the state a vacation land. ALSO READ:3 Things That Continue To Shock Tourists From Away That Visit Maine I had an idea. Imagine re-writing our slogans with brutal truth behind how it actually feels to live in Maine outside of the summer months? Here's what I got. Maine, Where Only the Strong Survive Winter Suffering the Cold in Exchange For Summer Maine, the way life should be, but for only 3 months How long is winter in Maine? As a 9 year resident of Maine I'd say your peak winter months are from December up until the end of March. Can you tell I'm freezing cold in Portland right now as I'm writing this? Is it that obvious? ALSO READ: 3 Unwritten Rules About Portland, Maine, That Mainer's Just Know The funny thing about local Mainer's is that they'd still choose to suffer through the snowy, gloomy cold months to get rewarded by our summer life than move to Florida full-time and I love that about us. I guess it's still true what they say; Maine, Worth a Visit Worth a Lifetime . 40 Maine Restaurants That are Worth a Long Drive to Get to Thanks to our great listeners we were able to compile a list of many of Maine's great restaurants, cafes, pubs and bakeries that are worth a long drive to get to.

college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-p (AP) — Harmoni Turner scored 24 points and Harvard beat Columbia 74-71 on Saturday to win the Ivy League Tournament for the first time in school history. It's the Crimson's first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 2007. Fittingly the back-and-forth game came down to the final few plays. Harvard led by five with 17.6 seconds left before Columbia scored three of the next four to get within 74-71. The Crimson had a chance to seal it, but Elena Rodriguez missed a wide-open layup with 5.2 seconds left, giving Columbia once last opportunity. After a timeout, Riley Weiss took a 3-pointer from the wing that rimmed out just before the buzzer. She finished with 21 points to lead the Lions. Turner, who scored 44 points in the semifinal win over Princeton, earned the tournament MVP honors. She was the league's Player of the Year in the regular season. Harvard (24-4) reached the finals of the Ivy Tournament for the second time in three years. The Crimson lost to Princeton in 2023. Columbia (23-6), which won the outright regular season title for the first time in school history, lost in the title game for the third time in the past four years. Princeton beat them in 2022 and 2024. Now the Lions will wait to see if they can get an at-large bid for the second consecutive year. Columbia made its first NCAA Tournament appearance last year as one of the last teams in the field of 68. The Lions lost to Virginia Tech in a play-in game. It was the second time in league history that the conference got an at-large bid. This season the league could potentially get two at-large bids with Princeton also in the mix. That would be a first for the conference. It was an entertaining first half that saw Harvard go up 34-26 behind Turner before the Lions closed to 44-42 at the break. The teams combined to hit eight of their final 10 shots, trading baskets for the final 3 minutes before the half. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Justin Stievenart, right, uses his son, Jayson, 11, for balance while switching shoes outside of his destroyed home in Harmony Hills trailer park on Saturday in Poplar Bluff, Mo. Justin was alone at home when the tornado came through and only suffered bumps and bruises. Many homes throughout Harmony Hills were damaged by the severe weather on Friday night that left one person dead in Butler County, Mo. / hide caption toggle caption Brad Vest/Getty Images A deadly weather system that's already struck large stretches of the southern U.S. with thunderstorms, tornadoes and blinding dust storms is expected to bring more destruction as it rips through the Deep South, forecasters said. The severe weather has killed at least 17 people, with hundreds of homes damaged. A tornado outbreak was ongoing across central Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley on Saturday, the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center said. Twisters were forecast to pose the most dangerous risk in eastern Louisiana and Mississippi, spreading across Alabama into the evening. At night, the storm was projected to reach western parts of the Florida Panhandle and Georgia. The center said there would be numerous significant tornadoes, some of which should be long-track and potentially violent, across the region. The Storm Prediction Center warned of a Particularly Dangerous Situation — an alert the NWS issues to signal urgent, more extreme events — regarding the expected tornadoes. Tornado watches were in effect for much of Mississippi and northern Louisiana on Saturday, as well as portions of Alabama and southeast Mississippi. Very large hail — some reaching 2.5 inches in diameter — and damaging winds were likely across the region, forecasters said Saturday afternoon. Missouri had seen the most casualties as of Saturday afternoon. The Missouri State Highway Patrol said 11 people died across four counties. As many as 19 tornadoes may have passed through the state, said Gov. Mike Kehoe's office. Gusts and flying debris powered brush fires that contributed to widespread property damage. There's more substantial damage from this [storm] than I've seen in my career, said Michelle Ryan, director of St. Louis County's Office of Emergency Management, during a Saturday morning briefing. In Arkansas, officials reported that three people died and 29 others were injured following overnight storms. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on social media. In the meantime, I just released $250,000 from our Disaster Recovery fund to provide resources for this operation for each of the impacted communities.

In the Texas Panhandle, where wind gusts topped 80 mph, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo, The Associated Press reported. Oklahomans spent Saturday surveying fire damage, after officials there reported more than 130 blazes across 44 counties. Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a morning press conference that more than 170,000 acres burned and 293 homes and buildings were damaged. Stitt reported one death related to wildfire smoke, and credited the low death toll to the success of evacuation alerts. As of late Saturday afternoon, more than 230,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark after high winds knocked out power in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according Poweroutage.us. In preparation for the looming storm in Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp issued a state of emergency. This storm will hit at the worst possible time, as people are heading to or already in bed. Be prepared ahead of time and remain weather aware as long as this system is in the state, he said in a Saturday afternoon post on social media.|2025-03-16|https://www.npr.org/2025/03/15/g-s1-54089/tornadoes-wildfires-south-missouri-oklahoma

A Nintendo Switch 2 report has revealed a massive launch game that will be available alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 right at release. The Nintendo Switch 2 release date remains a mystery, and the new report does not shed light on this mystery. The expectation is the Nintendo Switch 2 will release this year but when this year is anyone's best guess. Meanwhile, what the Nintendo Switch 2 launch lineup is also remains a complete mystery. To date, only eight games have been confirmed for Nintendo Switch 2, and none of these confirmed games have been confirmed as launch titles. Videos by ComicBook.com The report specifically comes the way of a well known Nintendo leaker that goes by Samus Hunter on X. While the leaker does not have a bulletproof record of reliability, they have had several accurate reports over the years pertaining to Nintendo. According to the leaker, the major Nintendo Switch 2 launch game is not going to be the new Mario Kart that was revealed alongside the console nor a new 3D Mario like some rumors have suggested. Rather, it is claimed the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4 will be the major Nintendo Switch 2 game at launch. Metroid Prime 4 was first announced for the Nintendo Switch all the way back in 2017. Then in 2019, Nintendo announced the game had restarted development. Then after five years of silence Nintendo resurfaced last year with the game and a new title for it, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. At the time, Nintendo announced a 2025 release date for the game, and it hasn't provided any more specificity since. The report does not provide any information if the game is still coming to Nintendo Switch alongside Nintendo Switch 2, but that is presumably the plan. It's far too late to cancel the game for Nintendo Switch. To this end, this is exactly what Nintendo did with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was originally only announced for the Wii U, but ended up being a cross-gen release at the launch of the Nintendo Switch. All of that said, remember to take everything here with a grain of salt. This is new report comes for a fairly good source, but it is still nothing more than a report. In other words, it is not official information. So far, it has not drawn out Nintendo for comment and we don't expect this to change for many reasons. If it does though, we will update the story with whatever is provided.

/ mm1 The Monaco grand prix is the original street race, known for its perilous walls and barriers, a circuit that can wipe out a driver in the blink of an eye. The track is a kind of tour guide, its route revealing the super yachts bobbing in the harbour and the bikini-clad models watching on from their penthouse roof swimming pools. mm2 at Monotonous Monaco: Is It Worth The Hype? / mm3 In qualifying Nico Rosberg proved too fast for his teammate, Lewis Hamilton and nabbed pole – yet another easy Mercedes 1 – 2. It was literally all down to a good start as to who would win the race, as overtaking is next to impossible, especially with cars harnessing similar power and limited use of ERS. On Hamilton's final shot at pole, Rosberg ran straight at Mirabeau, ruining the Brit's lap because of yellow flags. Of course, this bought back images of 2006 and Schumacher deliberately crashing after hearing Alonso and Webber were up on his lap time. Stewards cleared Rosberg of any wrong doing, but the Brit's body language suggested conspiracy. mm4 at Monotonous Monaco: Is It Worth The Hype? / mm4 Despite lighting up his rears dragster style on the race's warm up lap, Hamilton couldn't beat Rosberg off the line, and the two Mercedes started pulling away. There were a few safety cars and advantageous periods to pit, but the head of the pack remained unchanged. In fact, it was the pitting and safety cars that put another dampener on the race. Hamilton showed his engineers his spoilt brat side again because he felt he didn't take advantage of pitting under the safety car after Adrian Sutil crashed, despite the fact it wasn't 100% official there was actually going to be a safety car. He then somehow got something in his eye and starting falling back into the clutches of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo (the most exciting part of the race). When told this Lewis replied, I don't care about Ricciardo. Fortunately his eye cleared up and he took second on the podium. mm5 at Monotonous Monaco: Is It Worth The Hype? / mm5 The 2014 Monaco grand prix was around two hours of bickering and childish bad feelings… and no real on-track overtaking. When drivers can only win a race by a perfectly timed pit stop because they can't pass on the track, what's the point? Have we got another Lauda/Prost scenario on our hands at Mercedes now Rosberg leads the championship, and will the feud benefit the other teams? Bring on Canada! mm1 at Monotonous Monaco: Is It Worth The Hype? / mm2 I always look forward to the race build up and the 'spot the celeb' moments, but this is where it ends when the lights flash out. Okay, qualifying is quite exciting, especially watching the on-board shots as the cars sweeping through the bends at 110%. The 2014 Monaco grand prix saw the usual cars fighting upfront, the dominant Mercedes swapping top spot, the Red Bulls, Williams and Ferraris just desperate to bridge a gap that has remained since the beginning of the season. The following is a brief roundup of what took place in the race, which left me asking: Should the Monaco grand prix be axed? mm3 at Monotonous Monaco: Is It Worth The Hype? / mm3 In qualifying Nico Rosberg|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2014/06/monotonous-monaco-is-it-worth-the-hype/

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. It was a very rough deal last night, he said Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night. Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. The amount of damage was catastrophic, Dillon said. It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over -- everything was destroyed. Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. Homes and everything were destroyed all around it, she said. Schools and buildings are just completely gone. Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral. Tad Peters and his dad, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists flee the interstate to park. Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it's here. It's here, Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ... His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. ___ Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.

Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.wbaa.org/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

FBI warns Gmail, Outlook users about phishing campaigns, ransomware attacks Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, tech and others this year. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video LOS ANGELES — The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme. In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called Medusa actors — use a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid, the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets, the advisory said. At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer. Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.|2025-03-16|https://www.kens5.com/article/news/nation-world/fbi-warning-against-ransomware-emails/507-32ce7292-d403-4009-99a1-5bd048c56d13
March 15, 2025 at 1:42 PM PDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

720S WCOTY 4 730x411 at McLaren 720S The Last Word In Supercar Making So as you might be aware, this week the McLaren 720S won what is probably the highest accolade in the automotive world. It was named World Performance Car 2019 by the World Car Awards jurors, meaning the experts of the industry believe that it is the best super car in the world right now. And with good reason. This piece is our tribute to this unbelievably amazing machine, and in it we will try to work out where are things headed from here. When it comes to high-end supercars that cost well over $200K, it usually comes down to taste which of the available models you choose. Granted, you go and check out the performance figures and pour over the options list. But at the end of the day, you follow your heart and get the car that gives you the biggest fizz in your gentleman's area. And that is how it should be. The genius of the McLaren 720S is that besides being hot enough to give your sausage the biggest fizz it has ever experienced, it is also extremely good at everything it is supposed to do as a performance car. That is not something that can be said about any of its rivals. Take the Ferrari 812, for instance. That car has the performance to rival the Brit, and some might say it looks better and has a cooler badge which for a lot of people carries a lot more weight than that of the McLaren. But the Fezza is not a balanced car, in that it is way too hot to be really usable and enjoyable. Imagine you have a pizza which is two-thirds full-fat mozzarella. It might sound good on paper, but you can't eat it without getting sick. That's the Ferrari recipe. The 720S is a pizza where every ingredient is set just so. The same is true of the flip side. If you compare the 720S to something like the Porsche 911 Turbo S, again you realize that the Mac has the better compromise. The Porsche puts a premium on usability and practicality to the point that its supercar-ness suffers a great deal. Not to mention it is based on a fairly ordinary sports car. Sure, the Porsche offers awesome performance and can be used everyday. But it lacks the fizz factor you would expect from a car of that caliber. 720S WCOTY 2 730x344 at McLaren 720S The Last Word In Supercar Making The McLaren, though, it has the right amount of everything. The looks are super in every way, and yet it is not so low and wide as to be a pain to drive around town. The ride is sporty and tight, but thanks to some engineering witchcraft it is also comfy and soothing. The car has the latest tech features, but they are all easy to use and intuitive. And as for the performance, while the twin-turbo V8 powerplant can make your old chap explode with excitement, it can also be tame enough to practically make the 720S a daily driver. So it comes as no surprise that the McLaren 720S has won the world car award in its segment. The question is though, the Big Mac seems to be damn near perfect in every way. How can McLaren, or any other super car maker for that matter, improve on this recipe? How can a car be more comfortable, faster, cooler and desirable? A quick gander through the annals of automotive history shows that successors are not always better than predecessors. In their zeal to make the 720S even better in the next generation, McLaren could well end up ruining their perfect car. So enjoy it, if you can, while you can. 720S WCOTY 3 730x407 at McLaren 720S The Last Word In Supercar Making|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2019/04/mclaren-720s-the-last-word-in-supercar-making/

In April 2024, the reality TV alum and recruitment manager announced her miracle pregnancy after sadly enduring several miscarriages and going through infertility treatments. ‌ Although Conor Maynard was once rumoured to be the baby's father, he has put those claims to rest by confirming via a paternity test that he is not Penelope's dad. Taking to his Instagram, Conor stated: Earlier this week, I took a paternity test regarding Charlotte Chilton's baby girl, Penelope, in the presence of her legal representative. Today I've received the test results which confirm that I am not Penelope's father. I am glad that the speculation can finally be put to an end. He added: All I would ask is that people act with kindness in response to this news - there is a child at the heart of all of this and that should not be forgotten. I wish Charlotte and her family all the best. Conor. ‌ Charlotte Chilton previously tried to get pregnant through IVF / (Image: Instagram/ @charlchilts) The announcement follows nearly a year after Charlotte shared the joyful news of her pregnancy on Instagram. With a history of seven heartbreaking miscarriages, the teary-eyed TV star discussed her fears about possibly never being able to have a child, reports the Mirror.

After 7 miscarriages over my 20s, failed Insemination, failed IVF I was told It probably won't happen for you. These words for a lot of woman, are the words you never want to hear! , she disclosed. ‌ Yet someone decided I deserved a wish answering and I am now going to have my own little miracle. It was a rough start (never knew sickness could be so bad) but I'm starting to feel normal again! ! I wanted to share this with all my family, friends and #thetraitors fan base! ! It's been a shock to say the least but the most welcomed surprise ever! ! ! . During her stint on The Traitors, Charlotte had been romantically involved with her ex-wife Laura, and together, they had weathered a seven-year relationship before parting ways. ‌ Confirming their joint struggles to MailOnline, Laura acknowledged their past efforts to start a family: Do you know what we have had some great times together, we had a really cool wedding – Charlotte has been through a lot. We did go through IVF, we only had one cycle and that was unsuccessful, she recounted. She went on to say that undergoing IVF had been really difficult . She added: I think for any couple going through it, whether they are in a same sex relationship or not, it is hard. And being the other party is hard. I don't think that gets spoken about enough. We went through it during Covid as well which was even harder as I wasn't able to attend any appointments with her and everything. I very much felt left out of it. In an interview with The Sun in June 2024, Charlotte disclosed her struggles with getting pregnant due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a condition affecting around one in every 10 women in the UK and can impact fertility due to irregular or absent periods. ‌ Charlotte Chilton with her daughter / (Image: Instagram/charlchilts) Reflecting on her diagnosis, Charlotte shared her surprise when she discovered she was pregnant. She confessed: I was flabbergasted as I have polycystic ovaries which means it is hard to get pregnant anyway and I truly believed I would miscarry like I had so many painful times before. On October 13, 2024, Charlotte gave birth to her daughter Penelope at 3.53pm, who weighed 6lbs 7oz. ‌ Announcing the joyous news on social media, she posted: Princess Penelope has arrived and we have been enjoying our 'Penelope bubble' so much, I am going to be off the radar for a little longer, whilst I enjoy these magical moments with my precious girl! ! Thank you to all that have checked in to make sure I am ok! ! my heart is full. During a candid conversation with The Sunday Mirror in November, the ex-The Traitors celeb disclosed her tough pregnancy journey – confessing that she had despised the experience. She explained: I loved the baby inside me, but everything else was s**t. I remember thinking, 'This is vile. Women lie to women and say, It's magical. There's nothing magical about this.' . She continued revealing her health struggles: I was really, really negative, but I did have SPD [Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction, which causes severe pelvic pain during pregnancy], gestational diabetes, I had an allergy to my hormones. I had everything, so I was constantly in and out of the hospital. I couldn't do much for myself. I had to stop working for the last three months. However, despite her challenging pregnancy, Charlotte spoke with affection about being a mother to her daughter Penelope, saying, She's just wonderful, and sharing how much she missed her when not together: When I'm not with her, I feel like my arm has been chopped off. It's a huge adjustment, but I'm so in love.

NOI - The Indonesian National Police (Polri) has reaffirmed its commitment to taking firm action against rogue elements within mass organizations (ormas) engaged in vigilantism and activities that hinder the country's investment climate. Brigadier General Trunoyudo Wisnu Andiko, Head of the Public Information Bureau at Polri's Public Relations Division, stated that law enforcement is dedicated to ensuring that the business sector remains free from threats posed by groups that misuse the name of ormas for personal or group interests. Polri will not tolerate any form of vigilantism that threatens investment and national economic stability, Trunoyudo said in a written statement received in Jakarta on Saturday. Zero Tolerance for Ormas-Backed Extortion and Illegal Levies Brigadier General Trunoyudo emphasized that this stance aligns with the directive of National Police Chief General Listyo Sigit Prabowo, who has made it clear that no group should exploit the ormas label to engage in extortion, illegal levies, or other acts that harm businesses and obstruct investment. Before resorting to legal action, Polri prioritizes preventive and pre-emptive measures. These include awareness campaigns, guidance programs, and coordination with various stakeholders to ensure that ormas do not become involved in illegal activities. Public Awareness to Counter Ormas Vigilantism According to Trunoyudo, fostering positive contributions from ormas is crucial for maintaining order and supporting a conducive investment climate. In addition, Polri has intensified its efforts to educate the public on recognizing and rejecting intimidation tactics used by certain groups under the guise of ormas. By increasing public awareness, we hope people can actively prevent and report any threats to investment security, he explained. Strict Action Against Ormas Intimidation Every complaint from entrepreneurs and investors will be handled seriously, with Polri taking decisive action against ormas members involved in intimidation and disrupting investments. Trunoyudo urged businesses and the public to report any extortion, intimidation, or investment-related disturbances by rogue ormas members.|2025-03-16|https://noi.pikiran-rakyat.com/news/pr-4049159407/indonesian-police-vow-to-crack-down-on-vigilante-groups-disrupting-investment
Vice President JD Vance acknowledged mistakes made by Department Of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk during his recently orchestrated mass firings of federal employees, claiming that there were a lot of good people who work in the government during an interview with NBC News. Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I'm accepting of mistakes, Vance said. I also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I'm also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government — a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn't work. Musk, the world's richest man, is leading President Donald Trump's initiative to slash federal spending and combat what he calls federal bureaucracy, which has included the termination of thousands of government employees since the inauguration in January. The billionaire has characterized many federal workers affected by the firings as fraudsters who couldn't be trusted to do their jobs. I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job, Vance said when asked about Musk's comments during the NBC News interview. Now, how many people is that? I don't know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it's a few thousand or much larger than that. However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people's business, he added. That doesn't distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don't want the person who doesn't show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.|2025-03-16|https://newstalk1130.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-jd-vance-acknowledges-mistakes-made-by-elon-musk/
OTTAWA — Prime Minister Mark Carney has asked for a review of Canada's plan to purchase a fleet of F-35 fighter jets. The deal with Lockheed Martin and the U.S. government is for 88 planes at a cost of about US$85 million each. A spokesperson for Defence Minister Bill Blair said Carney has asked Blair to look into whether the F-35 contract is the best investment for Canada, or if there are better options. We need to do our homework given the changing environment, and make sure that the contract in its current form is in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces, Blair's press secretary Laurent de Casanove said. The contract has not been cancelled, and Canada has legally committed to buying the first 16 aircraft, de Casanove said. Carney became prime minister on Friday, in the midst of a trade war with the United States and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to annex Canada. The new fleet is set to replace the Royal Canadian Air Force's aging CF-18s, with the first four of the 88 planes expected to be delivered in 2026 and the final 18 in 2032. In an interview with the CBC Friday, Blair said he will be looking at whether all the jets need to be F-35s, or whether there are other alternatives, particularly where there may be opportunities to assemble, support and maintain the jets in Canada. The direction I've been given by the prime minister is go and look at all of our options to make sure that we make the right decision for Canada, he said. Blair said he will consult with the Canadian Air Force, the chief of the defence staff, and the Department of National Defence, as well as allies and partners to see what is possible. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin referred questions to the Canadian and U.S. governments. Lockheed Martin values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future, the company said in a statement. The White House did not respond to a request for comment Saturday afternoon. Michael Byers, a professor at the University of British Columbia and co-director of the Outer Space Institute, has previously argued Canada should cancel the contract because the planes are highly computerized, with Lockheed Martin refusing to share the full source code, and Canada would never be able to have full control of them. He said Saturday the 16 planes that Canada has already paid for are sunk costs, and the country should cut its losses. We need planes that can operate to their full capacity without U.S.-controlled computer systems, he said. Philippe Lagasse, a Carleton University associate professor specializing in defence policy and procurement, said there is currently a large scale transition underway from the CF-18s to the F-35s, which doesn't only include the planes, but also the also the infrastructure, training, munitions, and operational constructs for North America. Lagasse, who also served a member of the independent review panel that looked at the options to replace the CF-18s, said changing all those plans would be a massive undertaking. It can all be done, but it will put significant pressure on the RCAF and leave Canada with less capability for some time, he said. Opting for a mixed fleet of F-35s and another plane would be less disruptive, but costly and complex. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has said the total cost to buy, fly and maintain the new F-35 fleet would be an estimated $73.9 billion. A 2023 report estimated the acquisition phase would cost $19.8 billion, including $10.7 billion for 88 planes, $2.1 billion for weapons and ammunition and $5.9 billion for elements like design and depot costs, infrastructure and training. Plans to buy the jets have been in the works for years. In 2010, the Conservative government first committed to buying 65 F-35s without a competition, but concerns about the cost and capabilities forced it to reconsider. Then in 2015, the Liberals promised to instead launch an open competition to replace the CF-18s and not to buy the F-35s. They cancelled the plan buy 18 Super Hornets after Boeing launched a trade dispute with Montreal aerospace firm Bombardier, launching an open bidding process for the new fleet in July 2019. In a statement, Conservative defence critic James Bezan accused the Liberals of playing politics with the process to replace the CF-18s, saying the Royal Canadian Air Force should have had new fighter jets by now. But Bezan said if the U.S. continues to demonstrate that it is an unreliable partner and ally, then Canada will need to look for other options when it comes to defence purchases for the Canadian Armed Forces.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/03/15/carney-orders-review-of-f-35-fighter-jet-purchase-from-uss-lockheed-martin/

MG has a big year ahead as it looks to roll out a raft of new vehicles and enter segments it's never competed in before. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading It's all part of a goal to be a top-five auto brand in Australia by 2027, and a top-three brand by 2030. To discuss these plans and more, we sat down with Giles Belcher, MG Motor Australia's chief commercial officer. He's been a fixture in the local automotive industry for over two decades, previously working for the likes of Toyota and Hyundai. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer This interview is part of our new Expert Insights series, in which we'll be chatting with industry figures from carmakers, lobby groups and other organisations within the automotive world. It has been edited for clarity. CarExpert: MG was previously a very niche sporty brand. Now, it has a big tent with everything from city cars to high-end electric roadsters. What does the MG brand stand for today? Giles Belcher: I think the MG brand stands for value. Even back in the day with those two-seater sports cars and whatever they were, they were a value proposition in that space way back then. So, I think that has maintained its relevance all the way through to be honest. Today our key point is value. We want to offer the best-value car, in every segment that we compete in. Value, and also innovation. Again, if you hop back to the old days, MG was always innovating. I think I read a quote once that when they were racing against Bugatti in the old days on a fraction of the budgets, the boss of Bugatti said that they're like fleas. They don't seem to have budgets. So we're proud of that history. And again, we try and innovate. Do things a little bit differently. And, and that's true to this date. CE: We've seen other Chinese carmakers confirm premium brands and now MG has the Cyberster. Are there more models coming at higher price points? Is it more challenging to sell premium vehicles under a mass-market nameplate and is MG's brand equity strong enough to do so? GB: It's never easy, I suppose the brand transformation to show people the value in the cars, even at higher price points. But we stand behind the product, and we believe the product in and of itself is suitable for that kind of price. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We believe the value is in that car at that price. So we're happy with the way Cyberster is going. We certainly – I think, as we've said before – we don't have any volume expectations of it. It was more an homage to the past and a showcase of what design and tech we can do. So, we're comfortable with that, and we'll launch some other vehicles this year that are probably at a more elevated price maybe than Australia is used to for us – not above Cyberster, but we'll fill that gap. So, I think, by the end of this year, you'll see a real kind of laddering of value, right the way up to Cyberster – probably in a more logical sense than maybe you see now. CE: At the other end of the market, MG introduced really sharp pricing for the MG 4, undercutting rivals and helping fuel the EV price war in that segment. Is that something we can expect to see more of, and what's the impact of that on new and existing customers? GB: Look, as to whether we'll it see again, you never say never in this game, but we certainly have no plans to drop prices to that extent at the moment – but as I say, never say never. You don't know what the future may bring. So [we'll] probably hold fire on that type of activity for the foreseeable future. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer One of the reasons we did that was to test if we could sell electric cars against petrol cars at a similar price. So are people ready to buy electric, but the value proposition doesn't quite work for them yet? Or are they not that interested in electric? Let's see. So, we made the adjustment, and it showed that people are more than willing to jump into an EV if that value proposition works for them. So that did its job, I suppose, and we've been fairly clear that, over time, that price would go back up. And we've stayed true to that. And there's a lot more of them on the road. I see them a lot more often these days, and it gives me a smile every time I see one. CE: Overall, are you happy with the performance of the MG 4 in our market? GB: Yeah. If you look at it the last few months, it's been kind of the second best or close to the best-selling EV. It's certainly number one in the small cars over $40,000 segment in VFACTS, so we're very proud of the result. It's a fantastic car, it's award-winning, it's brilliant. So I think it's getting its due rewards. CE: Prices have fluctuated for many MG models. Is that confusing to MG customers? GB: You're better off probably asking customers that rather than me, but every brand has short-term offers in the market. So, drive-away offers change depending on market conditions, stock levels, demand levels, all these things. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer The drive-away offers in the market are basically short-term campaigns that can go for a month, can go for six months. It just depends on the market condition and the performance of that model you're trying to achieve. So, things do change, but changing them all the time is probably not ideal. And certainly, we're going to seek a bit more consistency in that space. But again, we have to respond. So if things change, if a competitor changes or the market changes, then we're a brand that will respond. If that happens again, we'll change again, but the ideal is consistency, I suppose. But we don't live in isolation. CE: Most MGs have nationwide drive-away pricing, but some don't. Is that something that's going to be aligned moving forward, or is there a logic behind that? GB: Potentially. I suppose, again, we'll monitor the situation and we'll change if we feel appropriate. CE: So in a market where MG has got one of the best warranties… GB: The best warranty. CE: In a market where other brands are offering generous warranty coverage, and other Chinese brands are competing or undercutting on price, what's MG's competitive advantage? GB: Look, I think the brand is a big advantage. It's a known brand. We've been in Australia now for eight years. We've been in the top 10 for the last probably four years, maybe three years. So we're a known brand, with relevance from today, we're also a known brand with a long history – 101 years now. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer So that shows I think that we're here and we intend to be here and the warranty I think that shows confidence in our product. 10 years – I know some brands have five years, plus another five years if you service in the right way. Ours is a flat 10, so we're very confident in our product. And I think the value in the cars when you combine the brand, the value we put into the cars and the warranty… And we've got a hundred dealers around the country in every metropolitan city. We're in all the rural centres, all the regional centres. A hundred dealers around the country shows that if you buy an MG, when you move house, or you move state, you might move into a regional centre, there's still an MG dealership there to help you. So, I think when you combine all those things, we're confident in our position in the market. Having said that, competition is always interesting. We respect all the competitors. But we're comfortable and confident in our own offering to the market CE: How strong is MG's presence in regional Australia, and is that somewhere the network will continue to be filled out? GB: It depends how you define different things, right? But from my point of view, we're in every regional town and a lot of rural towns as well. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Australia's always had one of the most competitive markets in the world, when you look at brands versus market size. It seems to grow all the time. New brands coming into the country, that adds to the competition but it's already pretty competitive, so it doesn't really change a lot. And it all benefits the consumer at the end of the day. Everyone has to do better, offer more. A better customer experience, better products to grow or hold their sales volume. So consumers win, [and] us in the OEM world, we're used to it – so bring it on! CE: Does MG still plan on being a top-five brand by 2027 and a top-three brand by 2030? Do those plans factor in other brands like BYD which has similar ambitions? GB: We certainly are aiming for it. That's our goal. Top five and top three. We're not walking away from that. We believe we'll have the product range, the value, the warranty, and everything else. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We'll have plug-in hybrids, we'll have EVs, we'll have the full product, the drivetrain covered. We believe we'll have the ability to do that. The consumers decide at the end of the day, as you know. In regards to other brands, everyone's going to have their own goals, their own expectations. So, again, it comes down to that competition. I'm not overly focused on what other brands are doing, I'm more focused on what I need to do and what we need to do. At the end of the day, there's a market that will be somewhere between 1.1 and 1.2 million people, and you've got to try and offer yourself to as many of those as you can and make them believe in you and what you offer. So that's what we're trying to achieve. CE: You mentioned the ute and there's also a three-row SUV coming. MG Australia is going to enter segments it's never competed in before, so how will MG lure buyers of those types of vehicles from other brands that have been building utes, large SUVs and the like for a lot longer? GB: Again, it comes down to the product and the value we'll build into it. If you look at every single one of the products we have in market right now, we believe they offer outstanding value within that segment. Not necessarily the cheapest, but the best value. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer And with the speed comes quality and specification and technology, so they do things fast, and they do them amazingly well. So I think whichever way the market goes, we can react and then be in a position to satisfy it. As to which way it goes, who knows? EV demand, as everyone can see, is not growing at the rate it was growing before. But there's a whole lot more product available in that space than there's ever been before. So will that variety of product drive more consideration in EVs? Potentially. Will hybrids continue to grow as fast as they did last year? I think to some extent last year was a bit of a misnomer. There were a lot of back-orders that brands were filling, that weren't necessarily people buying cars in 2024, but receiving cars that they bought in 2023, and in perhaps some cases 2022. And then all that demand got satisfied in 2024. So I don't think we'll see the massive growth that we saw in hybrids last year. It'll probably still grow, but I don't think it will grow to the same crazy extent. I mean, that was extraordinary. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Plug-in hybrids will be interesting. Once the FBT tax exemption finishes on March 31 this year, what does that do to PHEV demand? Time will tell. I think there's a lot of benefits in that technology for Australia. It's a big place. The people, sometimes even if they don't drive long distances, they think they might one day drive long distances. So they want to be comfortable that the vehicle they buy can satisfy that need. We're looking at some different variations in that space in tech and we'll probably have more to say about that later this year. But potentially, we're looking at variations on the plug-in hybrid technology to better suit Australian conditions. CE: Are you talking longer-range plug-in hybrids? GB: Just a slightly different technology. Let's just put it that way. CE: That sounds like a big hint about extended-range electric vehicles… GB: It's not the extended-range stuff. It's stuff that has never been seen in Australia before. CE: MG 3 and ZS now have hybrid options in Australia. What's the demand been like and do you see that growing, or staying where it is? GB: We've been pretty happy with the take rate so far. ZS Hybrid certainly has hit the market pretty well. To be honest, we're very happy with that. MG 3's growing all the time. We're very sure that we'll continue to grow as more people become aware of the offering. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer It sometimes takes time for people to become aware of the product that you have available. Always too much time than we would like. If I owned Twitter or X or whatever it's called, my job would be a lot easier. People find out about it every day, so we believe that when they find out about it, from people who drive our cars, a high proportion of them buy them. So, it's about getting people to experience the product for us. Once they sit in it, they touch it, they feel it, they drive it, we have a pretty good success rate with people buying the cars. And so that's what we're trying to focus on. CE: We've seen Toyota go hybrid-only with many of its model lines because that was the majority of demand, but Toyota's been in the hybrid game for a long time. Do you see a point at which MGs also lose their petrol engines in Australia, or is that still a long way off? GB: We don't have any plans for that right now. We'll continue to offer the full range of drivetrains to the market and let the consumers decide which one suits them. CE: Small SUVs are very popular, but one type of vehicle that isn't quite as popular these days is mid-sized passenger cars, except for the Toyota Camry, BYD Seal and Tesla Model 3. MG is planning to enter that segment with the MG 7. What's the rationale behind launching a vehicle like that? GB: It's a beautiful car. I'm dying to launch it so I can get one – that's going to be my car. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Look, it's a great car. We think it will resonate well in Australia. Again, we're not chasing Camry volume with it. It's a performance fastback sedan that looks epic, so we believe there's a place for it, so we're gonna have a go. People buy sedans if they're, I suppose, practical enough for them. Or the flipside is, are they design cool? We believe ours is practical and design cool. The green one looks amazing! CE: Are you going to bring the colourful interiors offered in China here? GB: Some of the colourful interiors are very colourful. We're working through that at the moment, but I don't think we will launch some of the colourful ones that they have over there. I'm not sure they would resonate with the Australian public. We're actually looking at the moment at a couple of different interiors for a couple of our cars. We think we'll be offering a tan or a kind of beige leather, a white interior on the ZS. So, there's a few things that we're actively considering at the moment and hope to bring to market relatively soon. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer With a lot of these things, they look amazing. But most people will end up defaulting to something sensible, unfortunately. But some of them do look cool. So always, we'll look at it. We consider it. I think we'll have a go at a couple and bring in a couple of alternate colours. We're probably not quite there yet, but we're close. CE: Some MG models have a full suite of active safety technology like the ZS, HS and MG 3, but others like the MG 5 don't. Can we expect to see greater consistency moving forward with your safety technology strategy in Australia? GB: The MG 5 was launched a few years ago now, when probably the brand was in a different place. Moving forward, we will see I suppose a more standardised, higher level of safety in every single MG we bring to the country. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We've looked at it. We've discussed it with our parent company. They're supportive. So I believe that will be our trajectory moving forward. CE: Does that mean that the MG 5 won't be sticking around? GB: We're going to bring to market this year a much improved safety specification in that car. Not sure of the timing yet, but it will be later this year. CE: And will that bring a full suite of active safety technology? GB: I'm probably not able to specify exactly what it is right now, but it will bring the vehicle up to a kind of standard in its segment. CE: Is there still a plan for the MG 3 to get a safety upgrade? GB: Later this year. So, our parent company is super supportive when it comes to safety and the requirements of the Australian market. So when we go to them with requests, they're generally very supportive and act as quickly as they can. So we'll bring those two cars with improved safety specification later this year. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer CE: MG parent company SAIC Motor also has the LDV brand, which is distributed locally by an independent company. So far the two brands have offered different products but, now you're going to introduce a ute, how does SAIC feel about having two offerings in the same market? GB: Look, I can't speak for them, to be honest, but when you think about the amount of utes on offer in the Australian market these days, the fact that LDV and MG are related brands at a head office level is kind of irrelevant, really. We're two players in a much broader market. So I don't see that particular issue. CE: But LDV is known for being a commercial vehicle brand, whereas MG isn't. So why would somebody choose to buy an MG ute over an LDV ute? GB: I think, for the same reason I was saying before over any [other] brand – our history, our warranty, our confidence, our network. It's the same reason they would buy a ZS over another small SUV. It's no different.

image_2024-01-13_164406207 / Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC - Advertisement - The Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC, will attend the Non-Aligned Movement Heads of State Summit from 19 to 20 January 2024 in Kampala, Uganda, as a Special Guest. Established in 1961, the Non-Aligned Movement – which shares 44 of its 120 members with the Commonwealth – is a grouping of mostly developing countries working together to advance shared interests. During her visit, the Secretary-General will consult with leaders from Commonwealth countries, seeking their perspectives on economic and environmental challenges and collaborating on strategies to deliver more tailored assistance. She will also brief leaders on the preparations for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, scheduled for October this year in Samoa. In a statement ahead of her visit, Secretary-General Scotland thanked President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda for the invitation and commended his leadership as the Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement. Reflecting on the summit's theme of 'deepening cooperation for shared global affluence', the Secretary-General said: Many developing countries have made considerable progress to improve the well-being of their people. But they are now bearing the brunt of a myriad of crises, with the lingering effects of COVID-19, soaring debt, inflation pressures and intensifying climate extremes and disasters. The absence of adequate international support forces them to commit more of their limited resources into protecting their people from these crises, which further compounds their challenges, eroding hard-earned progress on poverty, inequality and development, and is pushing many countries to the edge. She added: To tackle these overlapping challenges, we need more cooperation and solidarity than ever before. The voice of the Non-Aligned Movement is essential, and the Commonwealth stands as a trusted partner in achieving our shared vision for a peaceful, just and sustainable future for all. In her engagements, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland will draw attention to the urgent reform of the global financial system to meet the needs of developing countries. She will share how the Commonwealth's Universal Vulnerability Index can help better target international finance, including overseas aid and debt relief, for countries in need of support. The Secretary-General will also discuss the progress made at last year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) and the Commonwealth's targeted assistance to help member countries translate those commitments into action. In particular, Secretary-General Scotland will inform leaders about the Commonwealth Climate Finance Access Hub, which has mobilised US $322 million in climate finance for 17 vulnerable countries, with an additional US $500 million in the pipeline. She will also highlight the Commonwealth's coordinated response to ocean challenges through the Commonwealth Blue Charter, land degradation issues through the Commonwealth Living Lands Charter and a just energy transition through the Commonwealth Sustainable Energy Transition Agenda. While in Kampala, the Secretary-General is expected to meet with government ministers, senior officials, and other public figures to discuss ways to deepen ongoing cooperation.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/commonwealth-secretary-general-to-attend-non-aligned-movement-summit-in-uganda/

Lando Norris says Netflix's Drive to Survive 'needs to come back to reality' By Philip Duncan, PA F1 Correspondent, Melbourne Lando Norris has accused the makers of Formula One's hit Netflix series of creating fabricated, made-up nonsense and said they have lost sight of reality . Norris, who captured pole position for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, was speaking a week after the seventh series of Drive to Survive – which has helped propel F1 to a new fanbase – was released. The second episode, Frenemies , depicts the rivalry between Norris, 25, and Red Bull's Max Verstappen as they contended for the world championship last season. Verstappen, 27, was characterised in the episode to be deeply upset by Norris' maiden win in Miami, although the footage used of the Dutch driver – portrayed as being in the immediate aftermath of the Miami race – was from much later in the season. They need to show the truth about people more, said Norris when asked to comment on the new series. I'm not a fan of fake stuff. I want facts. I don't want made-up scripts and fabricated nonsense, which there is. The portrayal of Max, and how we were against each other so much, they don't need to create that drama, just show the facts. To portray someone in an incorrect way, people are going to have their opinions of that incorrect person. It is almost lying in some ways, and I just don't think that's correct. They just jumble up the whole thing and they don't care when they put it in. Maybe it needs to be more of a documentary of the season, more than a show like they're trying to do. It has drifted too far away. Verstappen also offered his response to the Netflix episode, saying: Apparently I was very sad after Miami. I literally had the best time ever Sunday night, so I don't know what I was upset about. An F1 spokesperson said: Drive to Survive has been a very important part of growing the sport and reaching new audiences. We should focus on the positive impact of the series and not criticise something that has been hugely beneficial to the whole sport. Defending their position, Box To Box Films, the production company behind Drive to Survive, said: The stories we tell across a series of Drive to Survive are not fabricated. The narratives clearly follow real events. In order to help make Formula One appeal to a wider audience, we tell these stories in an entertaining and compelling way, which has helped drive leagues of new fans to the sport; a legacy we're incredibly proud of. We would obviously love to have cameras with the drivers 24/7 to capture every moment as it happens, but this isn't possible; we have to edit the limited footage we are able to capture. The series is produced under incredible schedule pressure, and sometimes mistakes do happen. When these are pointed out to us, as was the case this year with some footage of Max post Miami GP, we move to correct these unintentional errors. Ultimately Drive to Survive is an entertainment show, not a season review, and we hope to continue helping F1 deliver entertaining content in future.|2025-03-16|https://www.anglocelt.ie/2025/03/15/lando-norris-says-netflixs-drive-to-survive-needs-to-come-back-to-reality/
After a period of controversy due to voice actor recasting and the divisive Tomb map, Call of DutyZombies has been building excitement once again. Its next map is poised to drop as part of Black Ops 6 Season 3, which kicks off on April 3, and will take players to the mansion featured in Liberty Falls' intro cinematic. Players have been shown images depicting the exterior of the mansion, a giant T-Rex fossil (which fans hope will serve as the map's boss encounter), and the massive containment unit housing the real Samantha Maxis. With teasers referencing the Chaos story's Order, and both Richtofen and the Wunderwaffe likely to appear, everything is coming together to suggest players could be in for a special experience. However, even though Black Ops 6 Zombies has a good bit of life left in it, Call of Duty fans and insiders alike are accustomed to looking to the future. Those curious about this year's Call of Duty release will find a fair bit of information spread throughout various reports, all of which come together to suggest an interesting approach for the new entry. Supposedly, Activision will be publishing a Black Ops 2 successor that offers a mixture of new multiplayer content and map remasters from the 2012 release, alongside a fresh campaign and the carry forward system. For Zombies fans, not only can they apparently look forward to playing as new versions of the original four characters, but six original maps with settings that sound more comparable to Black Ops 3's lineup than locales from the Dark Aether universe. Given how beloved that game was, this can only really be seen as a good thing. black-ops-6-zombies-ray-gun-firing Related Assuming Treyarch delivers a Super Easter egg in Black Ops 6 Zombies, it's clear what the best reward for longtime Call of Duty fans would be. The Latest Call of Duty Zombies Leak is Another Big Step in the Right Direction After Black Ops 6 got things back on track by improving on the fundamentals of Black Ops Cold War, it seems like Treyarch is striving to take a big swing with CoD 2025's Zombies mode. Per Insider Gaming, if Treyarch moves forward with the ideas it has considered, the next iteration of CoD Zombies could feature maps that take place in: An alternate version of New York that has been destroyed by a nuclear bomb following the Nazis winning World War 2 A Japanese temple that sits at the foot of an erupting volcano A space station that is stranded within the Dark Aether While Insider Gaming's report suggests some more grounded map settings as well, those being Vietnam (which was explored in Firebase Z) and Afghanistan (which could borrow assets from Black Ops 6's open-world campaign mission), the three maps above boast bolder settings than what was seen in the last several Call of Duty Zombies releases. After all, Black Ops Cold War's maps were all grounded and heavily borrowed campaign assets, Vanguard Zombies re-used multiplayer arenas, and MWZ took place on the exact same map as Warzone. Black Ops 6 has undoubtedly been a step in the right direction, with maps like Citadelle Des Morts and the Tomb being far more unique from a visual standpoint than anything seen in the current game's three predecessors. Still, BO6 Zombies' settings are a far cry from Black Ops 3's, which went all-in on the rule of cool and took players to a squid-infested 1940s city and a war-torn Stalingrad ravaged by dragons and giant robots. For BO3 fans, the rumored CoD 2025 maps could finally scratch that same itch. Insider Gaming's report also mentions possibilities like the return of Grief, one of the biggest Zombies maps to date with a TranZit-like travel system, and the option to play maps in the survival or Outbreak formats. Wackier Maps and Primis' Return Could Be a One-Two Punch For CoD Zombies Though there were numerous strengths of the Jason Blundell-led Black Ops 3 Zombies, ranging from Zombies Chronicles to lengthy Easter egg hunts, two of its biggest positives were its map concepts and character work. Based on all the leaks for CoD 2025, Treyarch will not only be checking off that first box, but the second as well. A previous report from Insider Gaming suggested that gamers would be controlling new versions of the Primis crew, and with the full extent of Edward Richtofen's latest scheme still unknown, this is not too hard to believe. Black Ops 6 has done well to feature some in-game conversations between its new crew, but for old-school fans, there is simply no matching the likes of Dempsey, Nikolai, Takeo, and Richtofen. Having fresh dialogue between those characters on maps that wouldn't feel out of place in Black Ops 3 seems like a match made in heaven, so nostalgic players have good reason to be optimistic about this year's Zombies experience. call-of-duty-franchise-activision|2025-03-16|https://gamerant.com/call-duty-black-ops-3-cod-zombies-2025-hype-why-maps/
(AP) — that ripped through parts of the U.S. proved deadly as well as destructive as whipping winds moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, with at least 17 people killed and scores of homes decimated. The most fatalities as of Saturday morning were in Missouri, authorities said, which was pounded by scattered twisters overnight that resulted in at least 11 deaths. The Missouri State Highway Patrol also reported that multiple people were injured. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. However, rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said. Officials in Arkansas said on Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency in their respective states. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving toward the state later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma due to fire. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) have burned so far in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. This is terrible out here, said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes, some of which could be long-track and violent, are expected Saturday afternoon and evening. The region at highest risk stretches from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi in the afternoon and then and western portions of Georgia and the Florida panhandle in the evening, the Center said. Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Apart from Oklahoma, wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. SEC cancels Party in the Park The Southeastern Conference already had canceled outdoor activities around Saturday's men's basketball tournament semifinals in Nashville, Tennessee, due to the weather forecast. With Saturday bringing heavy rain leaving water pooling at the Music City Walk of Fame Park across from Bridgestone Arena, league officials canceled Sunday's SEC Party in the Park. They also opened arena doors a bit earlier to let fans in out of heavy downpours. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.|2025-03-16|https://foxrochester.com/news/nation-world/monster-storm-leaves-17-dead-as-tornadoes-and-wildfires-ravage-the-us-mississippi-valley-deep-south-fatalities-debris-damage-states-of-emergency-oklahoma-texas-arkansas
Nope…. Republicans HAVE been trying to get rid of the agency…. But it's still breathing… And helping Americans… At the headquarters of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, faint shadows above the entrance are all that remain of the letters that once spelled the agency's name. In the Trump administration's broad dismantling of the federal government, the consumer bureau was one of the first agencies to fall, its offices shuttered and all 1,700 workers sent home. CFPB RIP,'' Elon Musk wrote on social media on Feb. 7. But the consumer bureau has refused to die. Last week, the agency's consumer response team was called back to work to tackle a backlog of 16,000 complaints, including dozens from homeowners facing imminent foreclosures. The bureau's Fair Lending Office has resumed preparing its annual report to Congress. And the front page of the agency's website, which had generated a 404 error message starting on the day Trump officials arrived at the bureau, is working again. The consumer bureau is emerging as a test case for the boundaries of Mr. Trump's power to unilaterally hobble government agencies. For nearly a month, the bureau's staff union and other groups have battled the Trump administration in federal court cases in Washington and Maryland, arguing that only Congress can formally close the bureau, which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis…. … A consent order and series of short-term agreements have temporarily halted, and in some areas reversed, what Judge Amy Berman Jackson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia described as Trump officials' shoot first and ask questions later approach. But Judge Jackson has yet to rule on the larger question of whether the Trump administration can essentially end the bureau by hollowing out its operations, even if it technically stays open. The functions that have been restored are only a fraction of the agency's total workload, but consumer advocates and the agency's workers see these court orders as important victories in the broader effort to resist Mr. Trump's dismantling of federal agencies…. … The consumer bureau is responsible for compiling a key mortgage interest rate released each week. Because lenders need that rate to certify that their loans are in compliance with safe-lending rules, the mortgage market would freeze if the bureau abruptly stopped publishing it.

Gombe had, however, spent two nights in custody before he was freed. Gombe, in his warned-and-cautioned statement to the police, said he was not aware of the maintenance case, as he was never served with any court papers. I do not know anything about this maintenance issue. I was not served and did not attend any court to that effect and I only came to know about maintenance when I was arrested on December 26, he argued. It was the State case that Gombe had a child with Patience Karimazondo and on their divorce, she claimed and was awarded $600 child maintenance per month at the civil courts in December 2013. It is alleged, Gombe paid nothing from the date the order was granted till December 2015, with the arrears ballooning to $14 400. Karimazondo sought the arrest of Gombe, arguing that since he was no longer resident in the country, it would be difficult to pursue him to pay the maintenance.|2025-03-16|https://www.newsday.co.zw/news/article/94775/pgs-gaffe-lands-man-in-jail

This week, I voted to fund the government and give House Republicans the time we need to enact President Trump's full agenda — because that's what the American people elected us to do. While Republicans are working to govern responsibly, Democrats are playing political games. In December, not a single House Democrat voted NO on the funding bill (CR). But this week, all but one voted against it. Why? Because they would rather risk shutting down the government in protest than allow Republicans to continue delivering results for hardworking Americans. This year's bill reduces discretionary spending, ensuring we spend less while still making key investments in our nation's future. It provides a well-earned 14% pay increase for our junior enlisted troops, recognizing their dedication to defending our freedoms. Additionally, while Democrats turn a blind eye to the border crisis, we've secured an extra $485 million for ICE to remove illegal aliens and enforce the law. House Republicans remain committed to a secure border, a strong military, and a government that works for the American people — not against them. We won't let partisan obstruction stand in the way of putting America first.|2025-03-16|https://www.texasgopvote.com/economy/putting-america-first-governing-responsibly-0016148
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WJAR) — A deli that has been a staple in the west side of Providence for several years is set to temporarily close.

Perhaps there is a stigma associated with a used electric vehicle. Maybe it's the perception that you're buying a used appliance or someone else's trouble. Or there could be concerns about battery life since an EV battery is the most expensive component of an electric vehicle. Whatever the reason, a used car buyer can find a used EV for a fraction of its original cost. Buying a used EV is unlike buying a refrigerator or washing machine. In fact, it's not much different than buying a used gas-powered vehicle. You can find low-mileage, three-to-five-year-old EVs available as certified used vehicles on a new car dealer's lot or ten-to-twelve-year-old, high-mileage ones at budget lots that offer guaranteed buy here, pay here financing. While three-year-old EVs are often the sweet spot, and you can find used EVs for under $30,000 that still feel like new, there are plenty of older, cheaper vehicles available in the used car market. To provide the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data for this article was compiled from various authoritative sources, including manufacturers' websites, Car and Driver, Kelly Blue Book, and iSeeCars. Please note that the models listed have been ranked from the lowest starting average used price to the highest. Price ranges were determined by looking at vehicles for sale online in good condition with less than 100,000 miles.

The Chevy Bolt remains a good option for budget-conscious buyers, available as a four-door hatchback or a small SUV.​ GM discontinued it after the 2023 model year, but it is a vehicle we think should make a comeback.

Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa's dog likely died of dehydration and starvation, report says A report by the Santa Fe County animal control agency shows there was no evidence of infectious disease, trauma or poisoning. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video SANTA FE, N.M. — An examination of the dog found dead along with actor Gene Hackman and his wife in their Santa Fe home shows dehydration and starvation were likely what led to the animal's demise. A report obtained by The Associated Press from the Santa Fe County animal control agency details partial mummification and noted that while the severe decomposition could have obscured changes in the organs, there was no evidence of infectious disease, trauma or poisoning that could have resulted in death. The report noted that the dog's stomach was mostly empty except for small amounts of hair and bile. The kelpie mix named Zinna was one of the couple's three dogs. It was found dead in a crate in a bathroom closet near Betsy Arakawa's body, while two other dogs survived. Authorities confirmed last week that Hackman died of heart disease with complications from Alzheimer's disease about a week after a rare, rodent-borne disease — hantavirus pulmonary syndrome — took the life of his wife. Hackman, in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's, apparently was unaware that his wife was dead. Hackman was found in the home's entryway, and Arakawa was found in a bathroom. Like the dog, their bodies were decomposing with some mummification, a consequence of body type and climate in Santa Fe's especially dry air at an elevation of nearly 7,200 feet (2,200 meters). Zinnia went from being a returned shelter dog to an incredible companion that was always at Arakawa's side, said Joey Padilla, owner of the Santa Fe Tails pet care facility that was involved in the surviving dogs' care. Arakawa, born in Hawaii, studied as a concert pianist, attended the University of Southern California and met Hackman in the mid-1980s while working at a California gym. Hackman, a Hollywood icon, won two Oscars during a storied career in films including The French Connection, Hoosiers and Superman from the 1960s until his retirement in the early 2000s. The pair led a private life after moving to Santa Fe decades ago. A representative for the couple's estate has cited that privacy in seeking to block the public release of autopsy and investigative reports related to their deaths, especially photographs and video. It will be up to a state district judge to consider that request.|2025-03-16|https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/entertainment-news/hackman-betsy-arakawas-dog-died-dehydration-starvation/507-67b22d11-ea73-42bb-a214-c657b7746216

Late header from Irish defender Jake O'Brien earns Everton a draw at home to West Ham By Eleanor Crooks, PA Irish defender Jake O'Brien's last-gasp equaliser secured a 1-1 draw with West Ham and extended Everton's unbeaten run in the Premier League to nine games. The Toffees were denied a penalty late in the first half following a VAR check and the Hammers took advantage with a fine goal from Tomas Soucek midway through the second period. Time looked to have run out for the Toffees but right-back O'Brien headed in his second goal in three games as the clock ticked past 90 minutes to earn David Moyes a point against his former side. Carlos Alcaraz came back into the Everton starting line-up while Graham Potter made three changes from the team beaten by Newcastle on Monday, with Lucas Paqueta, Konstantinos Mavropanos and Emerson all included. Everton began brightly but it was West Ham who almost took the lead in the 13th minute when Jarrod Bowen's header hit Jarrad Branthwaite and drew a flying save from Jordan Pickford. O'Brien and Jack Harrison were exploiting space down the right but they could not fashion a clear opportunity, while Vitalii Mykolenko's cross from the other side was headed just wide by Beto. Pickford was called on again in the 28th minute when a West Ham break saw Max Kilman find Bowen on the edge of the box. The England forward produced a neat flick and volley on the turn that Pickford tipped over the bar. Five minutes later Alphonse Areola was called on to make his first meaningful save as another move down the right ended with O'Brien sending in a firm shot from 20 yards that the Hammers keeper pushed away. Everton were then celebrating a minute before the break when Beto went down under pressure from Mavropanos and Kilman, and referee Darren Bond pointed to the spot. But he was directed to the pitchside monitor and quickly changed his mind, with replays showing no real contact on the Everton forward. Bond left the pitch with boos ringing in his ears from the frustrated home fans, and Everton struggled to get going in the second half, with the visitors looking more dangerous. And, in the 67th minute, Soucek gave West Ham the lead, picking up the ball from Bowen on the right of the area, turning sharply and sending a shot beyond Pickford and into the bottom corner. Bowen then tested a furious Pickford again as Potter's side looked to double their lead, before the hosts finally managed a spell of pressure in response. Youssef Chermiti, on as a substitute for his first appearance of the season, had a shot blocked, and the young forward also had a role in the equaliser. Chermiti's shot was saved by Areola but Alcaraz picked up the ball and crossed it to the other side of the box where Idrissa Gueye's first-time cross was headed in by O'Brien. And Everton could have snatched all three points but Alcaraz shot just wide from 12 yards.|2025-03-16|https://www.anglocelt.ie/2025/03/15/late-header-from-irish-defender-jake-obrien-earns-everton-a-draw-at-home-to-west-ham/

remains one of iPlayer's most popular programmes' EastEnders fans are speculating on the show's future following the number of cast members 'jumping ship' after it was announced Matthew James Morrison will 'exit' after three years on the square. The actor, 32, is best known for his soap character Felix Baker, is the sixth cast member to leave this year. Felix was the soap's first ever drag queen character with his act Tara Misu. He arrived three years ago to great aplomb with Matthew saying at the time: 'I am blessed to have the opportunity to step into the heels of the fierce Tara Misu as part of my role on EastEnders.' But fans had criticised the soap for not making use of the character and not giving him a significant storyline after the character later became a barman at The Albert and took more of a backseat role. EastEnders delivers 3.5 million viewers to BBC1 per episode, but despite spending £87 million on a new outdoor set for the show, its loyal viewers fear for its future as it is 'losing its best actors'. Expressing their disappointment at the latest departures from the 40-year long running soap, one fan said: 'They are losing all their best actors. It won't be worth watching shortly.' Another said: 'Why are they getting rid of the good actors? I still can't believe they got rid of Martin.' A Facebook user wrote: 'EastEnders is doing my head in getting rid of all the best actors and killing them off. I won't watch it when they are gone.' And another fan asked: 'What is it with EastEnders wanting to keep killing people off?' Matthew James Morrison as Felix Baker (left) in EastEnders.

He played four and a half seasons with the Sonics and also played for the New Orleans Jazz and Houston Rockets. Watts would go on to become a beloved legend for Seattle sports with his iconic, colorful and off-center headbands. Watts retired from the NBA after the 1978â€ 79 season due to an injury.

The first teaser trailer, posters and images have arrived online for The Dark Domain: MVW Mickey-vs-Winnie, the upcoming horror from director Glenn Douglas Packard which sees a group of childhood friends finding themselves caught up in a battle between twisted versions of the beloved characters Steamboat Willie and Winnie the Pooh; take a look here… A century ago, two convicts disappeared into Hell Forest, a place feared for its dark legends and whispers of a malevolent curse. Their mysterious vanishing marked the beginning of tales about a sinister force lurking within the forest, feeding on those who dared to enter. In the present day, a group of childhood friends, each haunted by their own unresolved traumas and fears, feels an inexplicable pull to return to the reform school they once attended. Nestled in the center of the forest's dark heart, the abandoned hell-camp stands as a decaying monument to their lost innocence. Its walls echoing with secrets and forgotten horrors. Each of them is drawn by a force they cannot understand, as if the forest itself is calling them to confront the darkness of their anxieties, regrets, and unhealed wounds. The forest takes shape in the grotesque forms of twisted versions of two beloved childhood figures: Dark Mickey and Dark Winnie. These monstrous entities, born from the darkest corners of the group's psyche, embody their worst fears and regrets—Dark Mickey, a sinister manipulator and bloodthirsty force of chaos, and Dark Winnie, a feral predator who thrives on destruction.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/public-domain-horror-crossover-the-dark-domain-mvw-mickey-vs-winnie-gets-a-trailer-poster-and-images/
More lawmakers are expressing support for a pay raise for state legislators. The current salary for a lawmaker is $24,000 a year. We lose people left and right because they're not making enough money to put food on their own table for their children, Democrat Sen. Mitzi Epstein said. Epstein voted with the state Senate for a pay raise for state legislators, claiming the current pay is not suited for a full-time occupation and requires lawmakers to pursue careers outside of politics. We are not able to recruit enough people from enough walks of life, Epstein said. State lawmakers are arguing for a pay raise after nearly 30 years since voters approved the current salary of $24,000. Tucson Democrat Priya Sundareshan mentioned Sen. Eva Burch, who is resigning due to the current wage. We are losing good members who cannot afford to keep being the excellent and engaged legislators that they are because the pay is so low, Sundareshan said. If approved by the Legislature, the proposal will go to voters in the 2026 general election.|2025-03-16|https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-15/arizona-senators-continue-to-voice-support-for-legislator-pay-raise
The Girl Scouts of the USA organization is named in a lawsuit that claims the iconic fundraising Girl Scout cookies contain elevated amounts of heavy metals and pesticides. The Girl Scouts have countered that the cookies are safe and pose no health concerns. USA Today reports the federal class action lawsuit was filed by a New York woman who cites results of a commissioned study of the cookies that indicated 100% of those tested contained heavy metals, toxins, and pesticides. The study was commissioned by Moms Across America and GMO Science. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Fatumanava-o-Upolu III Dr Pa'olelei Luteru (Photo Attribution: IISD/ENB - Kiara Worth) - Advertisement - The earliest ever recorded category 5 hurricane in the Atlantic has devastated vulnerable islands with scarce resources to rebuild and recovery Statement from AOSIS Chair, Ambassador Fatumanava Dr. Pa'olelei Luteru It is with heavy hearts that we citizens of small island developing states (SIDS) witnessed the utter destruction wrought by Hurricane Beryl, the earliest category 5 hurricane ever recorded. Many of our friends, family, and colleagues particularly in the South-East Caribbean islands including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada are now struggling to imagine how they will pick up the pieces from this latest unprecedented disaster. This monstrous storm is still sweeping through the region and the full extent of the losses and damages are yet to be ascertained. But we already know from early reports that lives have been lost, homes have been ground to nothing. Shelter, security, memories, history – all gone. As the people of small island developing states, the growing sense of hopelessness is intensifying. For decades we have been straining to ensure the world hears our calls for urgent, increased ambition on climate action. We have warned and warned that climate change impacts will only get worse. We have pleaded with bigger countries to commit to the essential pathways so our world can limit global warming to 1.5C and avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. Yet, we continue to be sacrificed on the frontlines of a climate crisis we did not cause. Our sea temperatures grow warmer, encouraging storms to strengthen at alarming speed and increasing the dire threat to our developing countries. The increased danger is evident for the world to see. It is critical that COP29 be a transformational moment in history. We demand to see clear action that will reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. And a new climate finance goal that is fit for purpose for small island developing states is imperative. Developing countries must finally get a commitment from developed countries to provide efficient flows and access to the trillions of mostly concessional climate finance needed to recover from worsening climate change impacts and build resilience. We are making it clear – small island developing states refuse to keep being pushed down the rungs of the ladder of development, taking exorbitant loans and paying interest to fix damages inflicted upon us. We refuse to be the sacrificial lambs paying the price for industrialised countries' obsession with fossil fuel proliferation. If the world does not stand with SIDS now, it is only a matter of time before we are all lost.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/unprecedented-caribbean-hurricane-highlights-urgent-need-for-climate-finance-says-aosis-chairman/
(KPELFM) - Growing old is just a natural part of life. Some people fight aging with plastic surgery and snake oil, others accept the fact that it just happens. But, accepting the fact doesn't mean you can't at least do your part to make sure your 'Golden Years' in Louisiana are as fulfilling as possible. From eating properly (which can be hard to do with all the delicious (but maybe not the best for you) food options, to getting out and moving. Going for a walk, doing some gardening, playing with the grandkids, or even dancing at Vermilionville, there are plenty of ways to stay active and live a long and potentially healthy life. The average lifespan has increased over the decades in the United States, from an average of 70 in 1977 to 77.5 in 2022 according to the National Vital Statistics System. Much of this is due to advances in medicine as well as increased awareness in actions that can prolong lifespan including proper diet and exercise. Not surprising, however, is that America lags behind the comparable countries average by 4 years, according to Health System Tracker: Even within the state of Louisiana, there is a disparity between parishes regarding longevity. The longevity average between the #22-ranked parish and the #1-ranked parish is 6 years, which is quite a long time to enjoy your retirement years. A study done by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute ranked the longevity averages of parishes across Louisiana. Below are the top 22 parishes ranked in order based on the average life expectancy in each parish.

In March 2024, Ms Zheng's 73-year-old mother signed up for a home broadband service with M1 at its store at Causeway Point in Woodlands. As part of the package, she received a free SIM card with 500MB worth of data. My mother didn't know how to operate these devices and already had a SIM card so she didn't need the card, Ms Zheng told Shin Min Daily News. She told the clerk she didn't need the card and he suggested she just throw it away. Her mother threw the SIM card into the dustbin at the void deck of her block. In her January bill this year, Ms Zheng's mother received a bill showing that the discarded SIM card had used up 68GB worth of data, incurring a bill of $695. I suspected that my mother's lost card was picked up and used by someone else, said Ms Zheng. And because she was still trying to work out a solution to M1, payment for the January bill was delayed and the service was disconnected. An M1 spokesperson said the standard procedure for terminating a SIM card is through the customer service hotline before discarding it. The SIM card given to Ms Zheng's mother had a lot of data usage, such as playing videos, browsing multiple social media, voice calls and text messages, said the spokesperson. When Ms Zheng's mother first contacted us at the end of January, we immediately terminated the service. M1 waived $600 from the bill.|2025-03-16|https://www.tnp.sg/news/73-year-old-woman-discards-new-sim-card-receives-700-bill
WATERLOO, Iowa (KCRG) - Hundreds of people gathered at Waterloo West High School Saturday to listen to Black authors read their books. Its in response to the Waterloo Community School District withdrawing from the University of Northern Iowa's African American read-in, which is a nearly 20 year tradition. Four Black children's book authors reading their material to a crowd of hundreds. It sounds simple enough, but this read-in almost didn't happen. Nikole Hannah-Jones is an author and the founder of Waterloo's 1619 Freedom School -- an after school literacy program. She organized Saturday's event after the Waterloo School District withdrew from the University of Northern Iowa's annual African American read-in The school district cited legal concerns, after the Trump administration ordered K through 12 schools to root out diversity, equity, and inclusion programs -- or risk losing funding. Waterloo School's reaction is exactly what these laws are designed to do. The laws are very vague. They laws are very threatening so we know school districts can't afford to lose funding, said Hannah-Jones. She said it's more than just a chance to highlight black authors, it's about working to connect children with their message. My granddaughter is in first grade and this book is called 'All Because You Matter' and because of the state and federal laws, somebody's telling her she doesn't deserve to get a book that tells her she matters, said Sheritta Stokes, 1619 Freedom School Executive Director. The 1619 freedom school handed out more than 3,000 to children who came to listen. Hannah-Jones said it's an effort to push back against recent changes to state and federal laws that ban certain books and dismantle DEI programs. This was a state that was a leader in education across the country. I don't recognize what's happening in Iowa right now. This is not the Iowa that I grew up in, said Hannah-Jones. In a statement, the Waterloo Community School District said The African American Read-In is a cherished event for our district, and the decision to not attend was a difficult one.|2025-03-16|https://www.kcrg.com/2025/03/15/black-authors-host-african-american-read-in-speak-out-against-anti-dei-policy/
- Advertisement - By Friends of Cuba in Antigua and Barbuda The Cuban medical brigades are rooted in the internationalist spirit of the Cuban Revolution, which has long been established policy, and its success can be traced right back to the very beginning of the revolutionary process. When Fidel Castro came to power with the triumph of the Rebel Army, on January 1 st 1959, there were dire health conditions in Cuba, especially in rural areas, just as there were widespread poverty and illiteracy. Of the few young people from poor families, who had got the opportunity to study medicine, most were waiting for many years, to save enough money to pay for graduation. It was the revolution that allowed them to graduate as doctors free of cost. Many doctors, who were members of elite families, left the country, rather than participate in a new, socialized healthcare system. It was therefore necessary to train as many doctors as would be needed, as soon as possible. But the Cuban revolutionary leadership was never just concerned about Cuba. Theirs was the cause of human dignity. The immortal Ernesto Che' Guevara, a medical doctor from Argentina, and who gave his life in Bolivia, while fighting to liberate the people of that country, was a passionate humanist and internationalist. Che' gave up his position in government, and role as head of the Central Bank of Cuba, to be a guerilla fighter and doctor on the African continent, among those struggling to liberate themselves from colonialism and white supremacy. That was in the true spirit of uplifting all humanity; the spirit of the Cuban revolution. Today, as part of the revolutionary commitment born of that great internationalist vision, Cuba has positioned herself in the forefront of healthcare, not only for her own citizens, but for people around the world. Thousands of young people from around the world, primarily the Third World, have been trained as medical doctors in Cuba, and Cuban doctors can be found working around the world as part of cooperation with the various governments. That has been accomplished by the extraordinary effort and revolutionary generosity of a people blockaded economically and financially, and under constant threat and hostility. The Cuban government and people know what they have had to do and what they must do for the survival of their revolution and for its internationalist thrust. The Cuban professionals fulfill their internationalist missions with great enthusiasm and pride. They also benefit personally in the process. Here in Antigua and Barbuda, as elsewhere, the work of the Cuban medical brigades has been invaluable, especially in affording us a range and level of specialist services that we so badly lacked until recently, in an increasingly modern society, where healthcare is easily accessible to all. The late Leonard Tim Hector, the man responsible for introducing Antigua and Barbuda to the Cuban Revolution, did not have the fortune of specialist intensive care here, because it was not until a decade after his death in our ICU, that we got our first intensive care specialists from Cuba. We therefore reject and soundly denounce the repeated false pronouncements made by the evil and uncaring Trump regime, against the Cuban Medical Brigade program, in an effort to vilify the Cuban leadership, demean the internationalist engagements of the Cuban professionals, and cripple the noble revolution. Leaders of the USA and senselessly bitter Miami Cubans choose to be shamelessly loud in pouring scorn on Cuba, a little blockaded and struggling island in the Caribbean, that is coming to the rescue of even countries in the developed world, while the average person in that country, which is the wealthiest in the world, cannot afford healthcare. With the most sophisticated medical technology imaginable, and with an abundance of super specialists in the medical field, the cost of healthcare to average persons is so prohibitive, that they avoid it, even at the risk of death. Because in the USA's version of healthcare, a trip on an ambulance and hospitalization for a significant medical intervention can create such a huge bill, that the patient becomes homeless afterwards. They can't find enough money to pay rent and buy food, and if their job is even a minimum wage job, it might disqualify them from a space in a homeless shelter. Meanwhile, here is poor and stoic Cuba, not only taking care of her own, but positioning herself to help the governments of our region and elsewhere to help their people. So helping and supporting Cuba is helping and supporting ourselves. Defending Cuba's sovereign right to self-determination is defending our own. Our governments must not flinch. Long live the Cuban cooperation!|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/no-surrender-to-evil-sickening-attack-on-cuban-medical-brigades/
NATO launches the Resilience Reference Curriculum From NATO: At a meeting of its Resilience Committee on 14 February 2025, NATO introduced its first Resilience Reference Curriculum (RRC) to support efforts by NATO Allies and partners to strengthen their resilience against military and non-military threats and challenges to the Alliance's security and to their own national security. These can include natural disasters, disruption of critical infrastructure, or hybrid or armed attacks. The curriculum contributes to developing skills and strategies to enhance resilience in an era of uncertainties, disruptions, interdependence, and technological advancements. It also offers a structured approach to understanding resilience and its critical role in national and collective security. The development of the Resilience Reference Curriculum was a collaborative effort amongst NATO's Defence Education Enhancement Programme (DEEP), NATO's Resilience Section, and the Partnership for Peace Consortium and featured contributions by experts from Allied and partner countries. In their foreword to the curriculum, Mr. Angus Lapsley, NATO's Assistant Secretary General for Defence Policy and Planning, and Admiral Pierre Vandier, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, emphasised the importance of resilience education, stating: All of this requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by our broader society, with education and awareness acting as key agents of transformation. The Resilience Reference Curriculum constitutes an important guiding framework for developing courses, study programmes, and training on the topic of resilience for defence education purposes. Allies and partners can leverage the Resilience Reference Curriculum to develop their own tailored courses on resilience, with support provided through NATO's Defence Education Enhancement Programme. Mr. Mariusz Solis, Lead for DEEP, highlighted NATO's commitment to assisting partners: The Resilience Reference Curriculum will be available to all interested partners and Allies. DEEP will work diligently to help partners who request support in implementing tailored versions of the curriculum for their professional military education institutions. NATO will also work to implement the RRC as a distance course. Supporting our partners in this way makes us all stronger and more resilient in the face of threats to our shared security. With this initiative, NATO continues to reinforce its commitment to enhancing resilience education and strengthening the collective security of the Alliance and its partners. Foreword Resilience underpins our efforts to safeguard our nations, societies and shared values. NATO 2022 Strategic Concept The Euro-Atlantic area is no longer at peace. After 75 years, NATO remains strong. Our success has always rested on our ability to deter and defend against all the threats and challenges we face – and we have to recognize that these have increased dramatically in recent years. As a result, the need for national and collective resilience as an essential enabler of credible deterrence and defence is more critical than it has been in decades. While NATO and Allies are implementing a series of extensive and forward-looking decisions to strengthen their resilience, a mindset paradigm shift is also taking place. One that positions preparedness for crisis and readiness to support military operations at the heart of our efforts to defend the Alliance. All of this requires a whole-of-government approach, supported by our broader society, with education and NATO partners' professional defence education institutions as well as the broader resilience community that is engaged in building a shared culture of resilience among civil and military stakeholders. At NATO, we see these efforts not just as a desirable goal, but as a prerequisite for successfully meeting the complex challenges ahead of us. How to use the Resilience Reference Curriculum About the document The Resilience Reference Curriculum (RRC) is designed to address resilience and its role in the contemporary world of uncertainties, disruptions, interdependence, and technological breakthroughs. Understanding and educating members of the defence and security sector on the concept of resilience is in high demand. Because resilience has different meanings and interpretations in different contexts it is challenging to develop a homogeneous framework that would fit all actors on all levels of governance. Therefore, the purpose of the RRC is to provide every interested stakeholder (military, civilian, public, or private) with a comprehensive package of information necessary to: a) Understand the concept of resilience and assess threats to it in their own contexts (Theme 1); b) Understand whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches to resilience and analyse physical and psychological elements and variables that resilience depends on (Theme 1, Theme 2, Theme 3); and c) Learn how to develop, implement, and assess resilience strategies in specific contexts (Theme 4). The RRC provides a guiding framework for developing courses, study programmes, and training sessions on the topic of resilience for military and civilian audiences in defence and security educational institutions. It should be viewed as a practical resource that can serve as a guiding foundation for instructors and trainers to develop and enhance their course plans and syllabi and adapt them to their specific contexts and classroom environments. The RRC aims to help educators, trainers, and students develop an appreciation of the broad spectrum of issues related to various aspects of resilience that are relevant to defence and security contexts. This curriculum includes vignettes, which are practical real-life examples that illustrate and reinforce the principal concepts of each lesson. Each vignette represents a short extract from a broader case study that can help instructors develop specific lessons within the larger content of the RRC. Some vignettes are used multiple times to underscore connections and interdependencies between various components of resilience. Each vignette includes references for further in-depth analysis of the case study presented in it. Based on the RRC, the instructors should be able to design courses that will enable the students to: 1) Differentiate and assess resilience on individual, organisational, community, society, national, and multinational levels. 2) Evaluate physical and psychological aspects of resilience and analyse their effects on national security. 3) Apply resilience concepts in various defence and security contexts, by considering a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approaches and particularly highlighting civil-military interdependencies and interconnections between all instruments of national power. 4) Operationalise the concept of resilience as a continuous and dynamic process by developing, implementing, and assessing strategies aimed at improving resilience in specific contexts. Key questions to consider while developing curricula based on this RRC: 1) When and why is resilience required for an actor at any level within defence and security sectors? 2) What are the components and measurable levels of resilience? 3) What are the factors that support an actor's ability to be resilient and what factors could diminish the resilience of an actor? 4) What is the role of government (both civilian and military components), private sector and civil society in developing societal resilience? 5) What actions are necessary to operationalise resilience? 6) How can an actor's capacity to be resilient be increased/expanded? The structure of the RRC The RRC starts with an extensive introduction to the concept of resilience by providing an executive summary of the curriculum content. It is crucial that the users of the RRC develop a holistic understanding of the multiplicity of important resilience-related aspects 4 before exposing themselves to the nuanced dissection of the concept spread across the four chapters of the document referred to as themes . Theme 1 elaborates on the concept of resilience in the context of defence and security and provides users with conceptual frameworks for analysing levels, elements, variables and successive stages of resilience. This theme also discusses threats to resilience and the ways of assessing those threats on various levels. Theme 2 describes the whole-of-government approach to resilience and demonstrates the interdependencies between resilience and various instruments of national power. It provides learners with tools to analyse the importance of close coordination and cooperation between government agencies, and explores multinational aspects of resilience. Theme 3 introduces the concept of societal resilience and highlights the indispensable role of civil society and the private sector for resilience in the contemporary strategic environment. Theme 3 focuses on the whole-of-society approach to building societal resilience, which includes governmental authorities, the private sector and civil society. The theme explores why and how societal resilience, as an indispensable part of national resilience, is crucial for national endurance, and how to cultivate resilience within society at individual, community, organisation, and society levels. Theme 4 is aimed at helping users operationalise and apply the concept of resilience by describing ways to develop, implement, and assess resilience across various levels and in various contexts. Each lesson contains core and supplementary readings that show interdisciplinary approaches to resilience meant to further enhance understanding of resilience.|2025-03-16|https://smallwarsjournal.com/2025/03/15/nato-resilience-reference-curriculum/

We talk about quantum states — that is, something can be at one of several discrete values but not in between. For example, a binary digit can be a 1 or a 0, but not 0.3 or 0.5. Atoms have quantum states, but how do we know that? That's what the Franck-Hertz experiment demonstrates, and [stoppi] shows you how to replicate that famous experiment yourself. You might need to translate the web page if your German isn't up to speed, but there's also a video you can watch below. The basic idea is simple. A gas-filled tube sees a large voltage across the cathode and grid. A smaller voltage connects to the grid and anode. If you increase the grid voltage, you might expect the anode current to increase linearly. However, that doesn't happen. Instead, you'll observe dips in the anode current. When electrons reach a certain energy they excite the gas in the tube. This robs them of the energy they need to overcome the grid/anode voltage, which explains the dips. As the energy increases, the current will again start to rise until it manages to excite the gas to the next quantum level, at which point another dip will occur. Why not build a whole lab? Quantum stuff, at a certain level, is weird, but this experiment seems understandable enough.|2025-03-16|https://hackaday.com/2025/03/15/you-too-can-do-the-franck-hertz-experiment/
Trump signs order to gut staff at Voice of America and other US-funded media organizations Trump issued an order Friday night to reduce costs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media and six other obscure federal agencies to the lowest amount possible. The Voice of America building, Monday, June 15, 2020, in Washington. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File) Credit: AP WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming, with the organization's director saying all VOA employees have been put on leave. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. On Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave. For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced, Michael Abramowitz, the organization's director, said in a statement. He added that virtually the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave. VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny, Abramowitz said. One reporter, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said: We expected something like this to happen, and it just happened to be today. The press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it condemns this decision as a departure from the U.S.'s historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the U.S. government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move. The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia. The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies, said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement. Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump. Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said. Without the international broadcasting, the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration's opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy, said Kent, an international consultant on media ethics. A video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America. Her video was made at a building leased by VOA that Lake described as a waste of money. She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building. We're doing everything we can to cancel contracts that can be cancelled, save more, downsize and make sure there's no misuse of your dollars, she said. The letter places employees on administrative leave and says staff would continue to receive pay and benefits until otherwise notified. It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and return equipment like phones and computers. The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week cancelled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organizations, such as The Associated Press. The administration has also banned the AP from press pools that cover the president and moved to take charge of what news organizations are members of the pools, and the FCC is investigating news organizations like CBS. Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/nation-world/trump-voice-of-america-staff-cuts/507-1ced0215-acdf-4eb2-b2e8-8f1d12af0808
2019FordMondeo Hybrid 07 730x421 at 2019 Ford Mondeo Hybrid Wagon The Stately Estate It is the European market that is keeping the station wagon, or estate, body style alive. Everywhere else people have replaced the estate car with SUVs and crossovers. That, in our book, makes the estate car cool because it makes it unique. And it would be doubly cool if you go for a estate car that is understated, an uncommon sight, and undisputed beautiful – something like the new 2019 Ford Mondeo Hybrid Wagon. Even if wagons are largely a Euro-style car nowadays, that doesn't mean customers aren't spoiled with choices in this segment. Trouble is, most of the available options in this market come from Germany, and they are all kind of, well, obvious. You got your T-Model Mercs, Touring BMWs, and Avant Audis. They are all great cars, but they are not unique in the way the new Mondeo Wagon is. The Ford is not as run-of-the-mil as something like a Volvo Wagon, but not as in-your-face as those krauts, either. It occupies a sweet spot somewhere in between. It looks pretty ordinary on the face of it, and yet when you see it out in the wild it draws your attention and keeps it for a time. The quality – being powerfully understated – has been a characteristic feature of all Mondeos since the first generation. It's just been boosted in this generation, and especially so with the 2019 Ford Mondeo Hybrid Wagon. But the goodness of this car is more than just skin deep. For one thing, the Mondeo is a lot more affordable than its German rivals, while lacking none of their joe de vivre. Then there is the practicality stuff, at which it excels (430 liters expandable to 1,508 liters) and in some areas even surpasses those cocky Deutche boys. What is more, the sleek and laid-back-cool design of this car is backed by sophisticated technologies. 2019FordMondeo Hybrid 04 730x318 at 2019 Ford Mondeo Hybrid Wagon The Stately Estate On the engine front, the 2019 Ford Mondeo Hybrid Wagon features a hybrid petrol-electric self-charging powertrain. this system offers a fantastic compromise between efficiency and performance. You get 187 PS of power, the ability to drive in pure electric mode, and CO 2 emissions of 103g/km. The car comes with a Ford-developed power-split automatic transmission that emulates the performance of a continuously-variable transmission. It also has exhaust gas heat recovery system that enables faster cabin warming, electric power-assisted steering and electrically-powered air-conditioning, powertrain cooling and vacuum systems. There is also the SmartGauge interface for monitoring fuel and energy consumption. So you see why we think the new Modeno Wagon, with the hybrid engine, is the coolest estate car one can buy in 2019. It is modern, practical, affordable, and exquisite without trying hard like your BMWs and Mercs and Audis. Then there is the performance credentials, and the famous Ford handling, paired with the excellent fuel economy and up-to-the-minute technology features. This is the wagon for the family man who hasn't relinquished his taste and class to the crushing weight of domestic life. At least not yet!|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2019/01/2019-ford-mondeo-hybrid-wagon-the-stately-estate/

LIVINGSTON, Texas (KTRE) - From dungeons and dragons to castles and swords, there was something for everyone at the Renaissance & Mythical Market in Livingston. Jason McLelland is the owner of Texas Craft Fair in Livingston, and he hosts different events every weekend. This weekend, McLelland brought the wonder and mystery of the mythical world to 3300 U.S. 190. When we started this, we got a lot of questions. 'Do you have to speak the king's language?' So we wanted to add the mythical aspect as well. So if you're a Dungeons and Dragons fan or a gaming fan, you can come out here and enjoy a lot of what's going on, said McLelland. This is the first day of what McLelland hopes will turn into an even bigger event as it goes on. Over six vendors selling a variety of items lined the space, with a medieval torture show stealing the attention of people walking by. There's a lot of these events that are outside of town, they're hours away. We want to bring something to Livingston that's free, that brings in all ages. We want to bring, as you see the performances behind us, we want to bring a mix of performances in. We'll do some gaming and stuff like that too. Jousting tournaments, and September's going to be a big deal, said McLelland. In September, McLelland says they'll have a bigger budget to make the event better, and Saturday's market was a way to showcase what's to come. Even if you're not a fan of the medieval or mythical, come on out because there's a little bit for everybody, said McLelland. The Texas Craft Fair's Renaissance and Mythical Market continues Sunday starting at 1 p.m., with more to come next weekend at the same time.|2025-03-16|https://www.ktre.com/2025/03/15/texas-craft-fair-hosts-first-renaissance-mythical-market-livingston/
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

Getting your Trinity Audio player ready... HOW SWEDE IT IS! … Palo Alto's elected officials moonlighted as tour guides last week when they welcomed a special delegation from the city's Swedish sister city, Linköping. Led by Mayor Mikael Sanfridson, the Linköping delegation got to hang out with Mayor Ed Lauing and enjoy a welcome dinner at the home of Edward Gerard Fike, vice president of Neighbors Abroad, the nonprofit that manages the city's sister city relationships. They also received a downtown tour from City Council member Pat Burt, according to the organization's Facebook postings. Burt was also among the city officials who joined their Linköping counterparts for a bilateral conference at the Palo Alto Art Center on the topic of sustainability. In recapping the meeting, Burt lauded Linköping for emerging a European leader in climate initiatives and recapped the presentation from the Swedish officials about the latest advances in timber construction. We really shared a lot of our best practices under a foundation that cities on the cutting edge … of responding to climate change really need to share emerging best practices because we're all inventing the wheel as we're going forward. Learning from each other and sharing our innovations, our experiments, what's worked, what hasn't is really vital, Burt said at the March 10 council meeting. The visit wasn't all business, however. According to Neighbors Abroad, the itinerary included an introductory lesson for delegate Malin Ljung in Palo Alto's fastest growing sport: pickleball.

March 15, 2025 at 4:42 PM EDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

ðŸŽ¨ Concept Overhaul & Game Vision After the presentation, I knew I had to step up. I went all in on creating concept sketches for the entire gameplay, laying out mechanics, environments, and key interactions. The goal? To ensure everyone team, professors, and future players can see the heart of our game. Concept 3 Despite the rough start, my team had my back. They reminded me that this is just one hurdle in a long journey. That moment reaffirmed that an incredible group of people surrounds me, and I refuse to let them down. Concept 14 ðŸ'» Programming: Hidden Mechanics & Mini-Game Milestones In the coding department, things are rolling along smoothly. We made huge strides in implementing a hidden mechanic (more on that later—secrets are fun!) and, to my surprise, most of the minigames now have their core methods working! That was an unexpected but very welcome win. ðŸ'©‍ðŸŽ¨ Art Department: Animation in Motion The art team is deep in animation work, focusing on both our protagonist and the guards. We're combining bone animation with frame-by-frame drawn sequences to strike the right balance between fluidity and style. Seeing the character come to life has been incredibly rewarding. ðŸ'ª The End of the Week: A Win in Disguise By the week's end, I was able to fully lay out the game's core concept in a way that finally clicked. Though I can't share everything just yet (gotta keep some mystery!), my professors seemed satisfied. That validation, combined with my team being on the same page, gave me the reassurance that we're all running toward the same goal. Concept 5 The grind continues, and next week, we tackle even more challenges. Will we have another redesign? Probably. Will it be worth it? Absolutely. Onward!

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.

The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed in the capital, Sanaa.

Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational.

Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then.

Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration.

Dr. Bob Arnot of Health Tech Without Borders told Newsmax Saturday that the ongoing debate in America about fluoride in public water systems is justified because ingesting too much can lead to serious health issues. If you get to higher doses, it can lower IQ in children. So developing children, it's, you know, it's a huge concern for parents, Arnot told Saturday Agenda. It's also a very big concern for older individuals who may have hip fractures — again, if they have those higher doses. And so it's rightly sort of left to individual communities.

The search for the next Phoenix police chief has been narrowed down to four finalists: Ed DeCastro, a 24-year veteran of the Phoenix Police Department, who currently serves as an assistant chief over investigations. Casey Johnson, who has served 23 years with the Oakland Police Department and is currently a deputy chief overseeing field operations and special operations. Michael Sullivan, who has been serving as Phoenix's interim police chief since 2022 and whose previous experience includes stints with the Baltimore and Louisville police departments.

With a stunning 5-1 win over pool leaders Brunei DPMM on March 15, Hougang United have blown Group A of the Singapore Cup wide open. The Bruneian side still top the five-team group on seven points after completing all four of their games, but must hope for results elsewhere to go their way if they are to hang on to a semi-final spot. The Cheetahs have six points from three games and will face BG Tampines Rovers (four points) on March 29 in a pivotal clash. The Young Lions (three points), who meet Tampines on March 16 and bottom-placed Albirex Niigata on March 28, also have a shot at claiming a top-two spot. A disappointed DPMM coach Jamie McAllister said after the demoralising defeat at the Jalan Besar Stadium: I thought we caused our own problems, we were very timid in the first half, and we gifted them five easy goals, so it was very frustrating. Positives today? I can't find that at the moment. Hougang coach Robert Eziakor, meanwhile, praised his charges' team effort. He said: We are spot-on in terms of tactical play, except for the second half. We were a bit sloppy about the last 15 or 20 minutes, but we made a few changes, and we got back in the game. Everybody worked very hard, attacking and defending. Can't single anyone out, it was a collective effort. Hougang drew first blood in the 20th minute, when Zulfahmi Arifin's in-swinging corner found Daniel Henrique, who directed the ball into the net via his thigh. It was 2-0 in the 38th minute, thanks to forward Stjepan Plazonja's industry. The Croat, who had lost the ball earlier, chased back to pickpocket DPMM defender Nazry Aiman and the loose ball then fell to Hougang captain Nazrul Nazari, who found Dejan Racic. While the Montenegrin had his shot blocked, the rebound fell kindly to Shodai Yokoyama and the Japanese calmly slotted the ball home. DPMM's best chance of the half came two minutes into stoppage time. Gabriel Gama found Miguel Oliveira with a through-pass, but the Portuguese fired straight at Hougang custodian Kenji Rusydi. But the Wasps pulled one back eight minutes after the restart. A long ball from Oliveira found DPMM captain Azwan Ali, who backheeled to Davis Ikaunieks. The Latvian striker needed no invitation to rifle into the net for his seventh goal in seven games. But Hougang restored their two-goal cushion in the 71st minute after a mix-up in the DPMM box. Racic saw his shot blocked by DPMM custodian Kristijan Naumovski at point-blank range, but Shahdan Sulaiman reacted the fastest to slot home the loose ball. In the 79th minute, it was 4-1 as Plazonja sprinted up the pitch in a counter-attack and squared the ball for Racic to hit into an empty net. The Croat then capped a five-star performance five minutes into stoppage time, calmly slotting past Naumovski after substitute Farhan Zulkifli had squared the ball to him. Meanwhile, in a Group B match, Tanjong Pagar United pipped Geylang International 1-0 at the Jurong East Stadium, courtesy of an 83rd-minute penalty from Faizal Roslan. The Jaguars have gone level on three points with Lion City Sailors and Balestier Khalsa, who face each other on March 16. Thai side BG Pathum United lead the group on seven points. Analysis Despite a slow start, Hougang eventually found their rhythm to break down a sluggish DPMM defence. The Bruneian side looked to have shaken off a poor run of form with three wins in their previous five games in all competitions, but might need to go back to the drawing board.|2025-03-16|https://www.tnp.sg/news/hougang-united-demolish-brunei-dpmm-5-1-singapore-cup-clash

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/
When severe weather hits the United States, there are ways people across the country can prepare for the potential impact of hail, rain, damaging wind and more. Tornadoes can take down power for thousands of people, cause catastrophic property damage and kill. The U.S. sees about 1,200 tornadoes each year. Experts say watching forecasts and knowing the meaning of different stages of warnings are key to safety. Here's what to know about the causes for these storms, and the alerts for watches, warnings and emergencies. What can cause a tornado? The large areas of low atmospheric pressure that come with some storm systems can spawn tornadoes. Low pressure is associated with stormy weather, and the lower it is, the stronger a storm can be. Low pressure systems draw air into them, creating those rains and winds. In the spring and the transition seasons — spring and fall and even winter — we get these really strong, what we call extratropical low pressure systems, said Victor Gensini, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Northern Illinois University. These are just storm systems that occur in the mid-latitudes of each of the hemispheres. If you think about a map of the United States and you draw a big U across the map, that would be a big trough, he added. That big trough helps promote the creation of this area of low pressure and strong storm system. How do storm systems turn into tornadoes? These storm systems cause very strong winds and hail. Combine that with the side of the low-pressure storm system that has warm and humid air that wants to rise, and there's possibility of thunderstorms. In the right conditions — warm moist air close to the ground, cooler dry air above and wind changes — the storms could lead to tornadoes, according to the National Weather Service. In that type of atmosphere where it's warm down low and cold aloft, and it's also humid down low, you can get air to rise through thunderstorm updrafts at a pretty good clip, and that leads to potentially severe weather, said Paul Markowski, professor of meteorology at Penn State University. Usually the stronger the thunderstorm updraft — the updraft is just the term for where the air is rising — the more potential you have for things like damaging winds, hail, and potentially even tornadoes. The other ingredient you need in addition to that temperature variation with height is what's called wind shear, he said, which is the term that refers to how much the winds change as you go from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. What are differences between a tornado watch, warning and emergency? The weather service's Storm Prediction Center issues a tornado watch in an area, up to 10 hours ahead of a storm, when conditions suggest possible tornadoes. People in that area, which usually covers several counties or states, should then be prepared for a potential warning. A warning is issued by local forecast offices when weather radar indicates a tornado is coming or has already been seen. This typically encompasses a smaller area such as a city or county. People in the area need to take action, such as moving to a shelter on the lowest floor of a building, and by avoiding windows. Tornado emergencies are the weather service's highest alert and are issued when a tornado has touched down in an area and catastrophic damage has been confirmed. They are rare, but require immediate shelter in place. What's the best way to prepare? People should have multiple ways to get watches and warnings and know the definitions of each, experts say. Weather radios can be especially helpful if power is lost and TVs and ordinary radios no longer work. It's also important to have safe, enclosed and underground shelters — or rooms above ground that are equipped to handle tornado-level winds — prepared in advance. In a lot of the parts of the country affected by tornadoes, there is no underground option, Markowski said. You're not going to be any better off leaving your house, frankly. So if you're in your house, just put as many walls between you and the tornado. Get away from windows. An interior room like a bathroom is a good spot. ___ Alexa St. John is an Associated Press climate reporter. Follow her on X: @alexa_stjohn.

I have always been forever thankful that in 1958, my folks migrated from Los Angeles to Northern California. While growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the 60's & 70's, radio and music was everywhere. My folks gravitated towards KSFO The sound of the city for not only the musical programming, but also for its broadcast of Giants baseball games. As I grew older my attention was drawn to a hipper KYA. Then some classmates in my Jr. High art class turned me onto KSAN Jive 95 . That's when the world seemed to open up right before my eyes. The headlines, the culture, the arts, the music. Wow! It all came out of my Radio like a soundtrack for my life. As much as I could, I was off to see live music. From the Fillmore West to Winterland, from the Community Theatre in Berkeley to the Oakland Arena & Stadium and all points in between. I never had enough money, time or resources to see it all. Along the way, while attending college, I had the opportunity to volunteer & work for FM Productions (later renamed Bill Graham Presents). This gave me the chance to see, hear and get turned onto music I never would have attended, given the opportunity. Kinda like what KVMR does on a daily basis today… Fast forward to 1989, when my profession brought me to Nevada City….and KVMR. Soon after arriving, I became a listener first, then volunteer, then broadcaster. Since 1991 I've had the pleasure to host a variety of programs through the years including Talkin' Baseball, The Blues Show, Mná de la Vox, The Thursday Music Magazine, Red Eye Express, Awakenings and currently Bear Flag Radio. In addition to being a broadcaster, the station has given me the opportunity to wear many hats such as co-producing the live broadcast from the County Fair, instructor of the broadcaster training class and was a member of the programming committee along with KVMR outreach in the community. I was truly honored when the station bestowed me with the Bill Tuttle Lifetime Achievement Award & the John Nickols Award for Excellence in Music Programming. What a ride….so far!|2025-03-16|https://www.kvmr.org/users/chris-towne/
For most parts of the western world, motorcycles are generally categorized as leisure vehicles. Suffice to say these leisure vehicles are anything but practical. Well, most of the time. In truth, there really are some practical cruisers that effectively toe the line between 'leisure' and daily practicality. One big contributing factor has been the ever-increasing emissions restrictions. With manufacturers forced to meet certain standards, most modern motorcycles are pretty economical. But, that is only one piece of the practical puzzle. If you are going to use a motorcycle every day, it also needs to have a passenger seat – not necessarily a given in this segment. It also needs to offer respectable levels of comfort for both city commutes, and the odd highway blast. Above all else, it needs to be affordable to own and run. The motorcycles selected here are able to balance all these key attributes of a practical motorcycle. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites, including Harley-Davidson and Honda, as well as other authoritative sources. The motorcycles on this list are rated according to MSRP. sport scout sixty Related The most efficient cruiser here returns over 60 miles per gallon 10 Triumph Bonneville Speedmaster MSRP: $13,995 Bonneville Speedmaster / Triumph In terms of design, we certainly prefer the Bobber, but the Speedmaster is most certainly the more practical choice. Not only does it offer passenger accommodations, but it also offers a place to mount some saddlebags. At nearly $14k, it certainly stretches the 'affordable' part of the equation, but we feel that the level of refinement on offer justifies the extra outlay. Specifications Engine Type Parallel-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 1200cc Max Torque 78 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 580 lbs 9 Harley-Davidson Nightster Special MSRP: $12,499 2025 Harley-Davidson Nightster Special static profile shot The base model Nightster might be a good deal cheaper, but it lacks a passenger seat. The extra outlay for the Special is justifiable though, because it doesn't just get an extra seat. You also get a stylish full-color TFT, a small fairing (more of a headlight nacelle), and different wheels. It might be marketed as an entry-level Harley, but it is pretty far removed from the average entry-level motorcycle. Specifications Engine Type V-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 975cc Max Torque 72 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 483 lbs 8 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber MSRP: $10,490 Moto Guzzi V9 Bobber aerial shot While Italian motorcycles are not usually known for their reliability, the authentic air-cooled V-twin which powers this Moto Guzzi has proven to be pretty solid. It is in a fairly mild state of tune, after all, so although reliable, it is not the most powerful bike. But, thanks to a lightweight frame, it has a good power-to-weight ratio. The balance this bike offers between style, affordability, and ease of use makes it a very practical choice... for an Italian bike. Specifications Engine Type V-Twin, air-cooled Displacement 853cc Max Torque 53 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 463 lbs 2025 Harley-Davidson Sportster S accelerating front third quarter view Related The cruiser bike with the highest torque rating on this list is not American but German 7 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Custom MSRP: $9,899 2024 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Custom Side Action The Vulcan 900 is an aging platform, but the latest 900 custom is still a modern-looking cruiser. The same can't be said for the 900 Classic, which offers more chrome for less money. For those that prefer the classic chrome aesthetic, it is the more practical option in terms of price. We feel the Custom is worth the extra $500, though. Specifications Engine Type V-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 903cc Max Torque 58 LB-FT Transmission 5-speed Weight 611 lbs 6 Suzuki Boulevard C50 MSRP: $9,299 Gray 2022 Suzuki Boulevard C50 in a showroom With the Boulevard C50, you get a fair bit of retro charm coupled with an authentic V-twin engine. Further than that, there really isn't much more to say about this bare-bones offering that relies rather heavily on its retro style for sales. It is now an aging platform, and in truth only makes the cut thanks to that passenger seat. If you are in the market for one of these, consider used options first, because it hasn't changed much over the past couple of decades. Specifications Engine Type V-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 805cc Max Torque 52 LB-FT Transmission 5-speed Weight 611 lbs 5 Honda Shadow Aero ABS MSRP: $8,249 Honda Shadow Aero side profile view Just like the aforementioned C50 and the Vulcan 900 Classic, the Shadow Aero offers traditional chrome-heavy metric styling. The silhouette of these three bikes is eerily similar, so much so that we can't help but feel like all of them were 'design-by-committee' projects way back when. What gives it an edge over the other two bikes is ABS, a lower sticker price, and Honda build quality. Specifications Engine Type V-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 745cc Max Torque 48 LB-FT Transmission 5-speed Weight 570 lbs 4 Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 MSRP: $6,999 Royal Enfield Super Meteor / Royal Enfield So far, the Super Meteor 650 is busy proving doubters wrong. Cheap is not meant to be good. Well, at least not this good. The Meteor won't bowl anyone over with face-melting torque, but it has 'enough' power. It will get up to highway speed just fine, handle any city commute, and certainly won't break the bank when it comes time to service the thing. Specifications Engine Type Parallel-Twin, air-cooled Displacement 648cc Max Torque 39 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 530 lbs 2025 Honda Rebel 300 accelerating front third quarter view Related If you are shopping around for your first motorcycle, consider one of these cruisers 3 Kawasaki Eliminator MSRP: $6,499 Eliminator / Kawasaki As we get to the smaller bikes, comfort may come into question. The ergo fit system Kawasaki makes a lot of noise about, which works both ways in this regard, meaning this bike will be comfortable for a wide range of riders. With its Ninja 500-sourced engine, it will be on the sporty side, so you will need to embrace the revvy nature of the powertrain. Specifications Engine Type Parallel-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 451cc Max Torque 32 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 386 lbs 2 Moto Morini Calibro 700 MSRP: $5,999 Moto Morini Calibro cruiser hd wallpaper The Kawasaki Vulcan S might be conspicuous in its absence, but this essentially has a stroked-out version of the Vulcan S engine – built under license, not copied, mind you – in a lighter frame. It is pretty hard to ignore the value proposition here. ABS comes as standard and so does the passenger seat (not pictured, but it comes with the bike). It also offers an Italian design which is arguably better than anything Kawasaki has come up with in recent times. Specifications Engine Type Parallel-Twin, liquid-cooled Displacement 693cc Max Torque 50 LB-FT Transmission 6-speed Weight 443 lbs 1 CFMoto 450CL-C MSRP: $5,799 Rider on a 2025 CF Moto 450CL-C / CFMoto Chinese manufacturers were always eventually going to get it right. Just like in other market segments, what was initially just 'dumping' terrible products has evolved into actual value. The CFMoto 450CL-C has the Honda Rebel 500 and the aforementioned Eliminator squarely in its sights and, in some respects, actually beats both of those bikes. The 450 engine is a CFMoto design and has been around for quite some time in other markets. It is a punchy little motor and has proven to be reliable. The only downside is the fact that the build quality isn't quite at the same level as Japanese bikes.

CINCINNATI (WXIX) - Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is asking President Donald Trump to move NASA's headquarters to Cleveland. DeWine sent Trump a letter shared Saturday on the governor's Facebook page and other social media accounts. NASA's lease on its current building in Washington D.C. expires in 2028. Other states including Florida and Texas also are vying for the space agency's headquarters. As Governor of Ohio, I am writing to strongly recommend that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters be relocated to the NASA Glenn Research Center, DeWine wrote. This is an optimal time to move Headquarters out of the Washington, D.C. area, take advantage of a much more economical location, and gain significant efficiencies through co-location with a vibrant NASA Research Center. Ohio is the birthplace of aviation, the heart of America's aerospace industry, and a critical hub for advanced technology, research, and manufacturing, including the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton and Ohio's newly designated Hub of Aerospace and Defense Innovation in Youngstown. This move would also align with the Administration's efforts to decentralize federal agencies. Cleveland, home to NASA Glenn Research Center, offers a significantly lower cost of living and operating expenses than Washington. Relocating NASA HQ to Ohio would result in substantial savings for taxpayers while maintaining access to world-class aerospace research and development resources. Ohio's research and development capabilities are unmatched in the nation, DeWine wrote. Moving the NASA HQ to Ohio would provide an exciting opportunity to capitalize on the synergy between the Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Materiel Command, and NASA Glenn Research Center, as well as commercial space companies testing at Armstrong Test Facility in Sandusky and the Nanoracks-Mitsubishi-Airbus-Palantir STARLAB effort in Columbus. In conclusion, he wrote: Placing NASA HQ in Cleveland would reinforce Ohio as an international leader in both space exploration and aeronautics innovation. I urge the Administration and NASA leadership to place NASA Headquarters in Ohio -- the 'Heart of it All!' So far, DeWine's Facebook post has generated at least 1,000 likes and nearly 400 comments. Earlier this week, a group of congressional lawmakers from Ohio also urged the Trump administration to consider moving the space agency's headquarters to Cleveland. They sent a letter Tuesday to Vice President JD Vance, who is a native of Middletown in Ohio, and NASA Administrator-designate Jared Isaacman saying: Ohio presents a uniquely advantageous case due to its rich aerospace heritage, lower operational costs, and central role in the nation's technology and defense sectors. Read their letter here: The letter was signed by Republicans Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted as well as Reps. Warren Davidson, Mike Turner, Maxx Miller, Troy Balderson, Michael Rulli, Mike Carey, Bob Latta, Dave Taylor, Dave Joyce, Jim Jordan and Democrat Marcy Kaptur. Not to be outdone, Republican Florida Sens. Rick Scott and Ashley Moodyintroduced a bill Friday proposing the NASA headquarters move to the Space Coast in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral's Space Force Station.

Grae Morris has stormed to victory in Round 2 of the iQFOiL International Games in Cadiz, Spain, claiming his first major international win. Taking on a stacked fleet of 74 top-tier sailors, Morris was in a league of his own, winning an incredible 11 of 15 qualifying races to secure pole position heading into the Grand Final. The event was marked by some of the most extreme wind and wave conditions ever faced in an iQFOiL regatta. Throughout the week, competitors battled through brutal winds and towering swells, pushing both their skills and equipment to the limit. Despite the chaos, Morris remained composed, showcasing his ability to handle high-pressure racing in some of the most challenging conditions seen in the class. The medal series followed a new format, where the first competitor to win two races secured the overall regatta victory. As the series leader entering the final, Morris was granted one automatic win, meaning he only needed to win one race to claim the title. The first race saw Morris comfortably in the lead until a crash at the top mark cost him the win. The second race was just as dramatic with Dutch sailor Max Castelein looking poised to take it, but a last-minute crash opened the door for Morris, who seized the moment to secure his second win and claim the championship. It was a fun medal race series, learning the different format, Morris reflected. I got a taste of losing and then got lucky in the second one. I'm pretty happy I got another chance after I crashed out—it was a good day. He added, Other than the Olympics, that was the most fun I've had in a medal race. Everyone gets a chance, and I'm loving the new format. Morris' coach, Arthur Brett, was equally pleased with the result, Grae was in good form this week, and we are invested in what lies ahead. From my perspective, it was great to get the European part of the Olympic quad underway. It's still early in the campaign, and we will learn a lot more in the coming regattas. Discussing their summer training program, Brett noted, Our training is pretty isolated from the rest of the world, so it's nice to have some validation of where we are at. It has been fantastic having an Aussie squad training with Grae at home. The next stop on the calendar is the Trofeo Princesa Sofía Regatta in Palma, Mallorca. Running from 31st March to 5th April, the event marks the first Sailing Grand Slam of the season, where a strong Australian contingent is set to hit the start line across the Olympic classes.

They've been trying to figure out how to solve the traffic problem in Greater Gorham since the 80s. Last year the Maine Turnpike lit a fire trying to solve a huge problem of traffic congestion around Gorham, Scarborough, Westbrook, and South Portland. But just how much traffic does this area see? READ MORE:I Was Left Speechless After Encounter With Portland, Maine, Parking Attendant Gorham Connector How much traffic passed through Route 114 and 22? It's insane how much traffic has grown! The Bangor Daily News reported that from a review from the Maine Department of Transportation, traffic on Brackett Road (which runs south from Main Street in Gorham toward Route 22) has more than doubled since the 1990s. Senator Bill Diamond, a Democrat from Windham who's on the Legislature's transportation committee, says, It's a real bottleneck, and it's really a situation that does need to be addressed. Public outcry and going through part of Smiling Hill Farm in Westbrook, Maine kills the plan According to Mainebiz, there was a joint statement from the Maine Transportation Authority and the MDOT. It noted that there was extensive feedback from the public and civic leaders calling for 'a broader, more holistic, and multimodal approach to addressing the region's mobility challenges.' In other words, back to the drawing board. Now what happens to ease the horrible traffic in Greater Gorham?

Fair enough, it was the Maine Turnpike Authority wanting a piece of it. The farm's land was probably the most controversial part of the proposal and whipped up the most outcry.

A sea of people converged in Serbia's capital Belgrade Saturday in what was the largest in a series of anti-corruption demonstrations that have upended the Balkan country in recent months. At one point the crowd stretched for nearly two kilometres, with people filling the streets in and around the parliament and the capital's main pedestrian square. We have gathered in the streets primarily to express our complete dissatisfaction after years of dictatorship, lawlessness, and corruption, said one demonstrator, Ognjen Djordjevic, a 28-year-old resident from Belgrade. The movement formed after 15 people were killed when a railway station roof collapsed in the city of Novi Sad in November, igniting long-simmering anger over alleged corruption and lax oversight in construction projects. After Saturday's rally, the interior ministry said that at least 107,000 people had turned out. The Public Assembly Archive -- a group that monitors crowd size -- gave a much higher figure. It estimated that between 275,000 to 325,000 people took to the streets. If that estimate was correct, that would make Saturday's protest one of the largest in Serbia's recent history. - 'Incidents and clashes' - For weeks, student-led protesters have criss-crossed the country, holding rallies in Serbia's major cities. They have also taken their anti-corruption crusade to the rural areas and small towns that have long been the backbone of Vucic's support. Their return to Belgrade on Saturday ramped up already compounding pressure on President Aleksandar Vucic's government, with several high-ranking officials, including the prime minister, having resigned in recent months. Saturday's protest, like the others before it, cut across a wide-spectrum of society, bringing together those aligned with the far left and right. Amid scores of Serbian flags, some waved banners calling for environmental protection, while others demanded the return of the former breakaway province of Kosovo. Following hours of peaceful protests, police later reported that there had been some incidents and clashes among some participants of the protests. Around 7:20 pm (18:20 GMT), a leading student group called on all protesters to exit the area near the parliament, citing security concerns after bottles and stones were allegedly thrown. The reports of scattered incidents came as fears rose over potential clashes with supporters of Vucic's embattled government, who had also gathered in the capital. - Vukic defiant - In the days leading up to the protest, ultranationalists, and militia members camped out near the parliament and presidency. Ahead of the protest, layers of riot police earlier fanned out near the encampment and around the parliament. Late Saturday, President Vucic took to the airways again. There were no casualties or serious injuries, Vucic said during the national address. I'm proud of the police who ensured security for all participants, he added, saying he believed 99 percent of students had remained peaceful. A day earlier, Vucic had struck a defiant tone, saying he would not let the streets set the rules in this country . - 'Regime escalating tensions' - Some analysts had earlier warned that the situation would escalate. We can already see for a few days that the regime is trying to escalate tensions, said political analyst Srdjan Cvijic. Government-backed media also broadcasted increasingly inflammatory accusations, saying the students are planning to launch a coup , with Vucic accusing the demonstrators of organising large-scale violence . However, the day passed with no major incidents. Farmers, students, bikers and other civilians mingled along the main thoroughfares in downtown Belgrade, as a parade of tractors headed toward the parliament as crowds amassed. Ahead of the main afternoon protest, thousands also stood for 15 minutes of silence beginning at 11:52 am to honour the victims of the Novi Sad tragedy, with the time marking the moment of the roof's collapse. The ritual was repeated again in the evening, as a sprawling crowd at a major traffic roundabout waved their illuminated mobile phones in the air. We came for justice, Milica Stojanovic, a student at the Faculty of Biology in Belgrade, told AFP. I hope that after this protest, things will change, she added mp-ds/jj|2025-03-16|https://www.thedigitalcourier.com/news/national/massive-anti-graft-rally-engulfs-serbias-capital/article_4ed337d2-17b8-5bad-955a-bc352e1c4688.html
Trump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later Trump invoked the 1798 Act Saturday, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2, to speed up mass deportations. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, March 3, 2025. Credit: Pool via AP WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.whas11.com/article/news/nation-world/judge-limits-trumps-deport-people-under-alien-enemies-act/507-11894e2b-e26c-4121-965a-0d38c250227e
Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images (SANA'A, Yemen) — President Donald Trump announced he ordered the U.S. military to launch decisive and powerful military action against the Houthis in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective. A U.S. official confirmed to ABC News that U.S. air and naval assets hit dozens of Houthi targets in Yemen, including missiles, radars and drone and air defense systems. The official characterized the attacks as an opening salvo against the Houthis and sends a strong message to Iran. A spokesman for Yemen's ministry of health said at least nine people have been killed in the strikes and another nine injured. He said most of the casualties were civilians, and the number of those killed and injured will be updated as rescue and recovery efforts continue. The strikes are the largest and most significant military action that Trump has taken in his second term. The Houthi attacks were carried out by fighter jets from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, now in the northern Red Sea, as well as Air Force attack planes and armed drones launched from bases in the region, according to a source familiar with the plan. Trump approved the plan on Friday, the source added. The strikes Saturday are the result of several high-level White House meetings this week with Trump and top national security aides, including Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Michael E. Kurilla. The attacks could intensify in scope and scale depending on the Houthi reaction, a source familiar with the plan said. The source stressed this is not expected to be a single day event and said that this will be decisive. Earlier in March, the Houthis warned they would resume attacking shipping vessels if Israel's blockade of aid in Gaza continued. Trump also had a stark message for Iran, writing that its support for the Houthis must end immediately. The president redesignated the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization via an executive order in first days in office. In a message to the Houthis, Trump threatened that if the attacks don't stop, then hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before. The Biden administration also conducted multiple strikes against the Houthis as they disrupted international shipping lanes in the Red Sea with attacks. The last U.S. airstrike in Yemen against the Houthis occurred on Jan. 8, while former President Joe Biden was still in office, when a precision strike targeted two underground ammunition bunkers. There had been no other airstrikes since then partly because the Houthis stopped attacking ships during the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel. Trump slammed his predecessor, writing, Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. Since the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, the Houthis have launched more than 100 attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, causing disruptions to global trade through one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. The Houthi rebels had initially framed their attacks as a way to pressure Israel to stop the war that was launched following the Oct. 7 terrorist attack. But as shippers began to avoid the regions of the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, the rebel strikes still continued.|2025-03-16|https://weisradio.com/2025/03/15/trump-orders-attacks-against-houthis-in-yemen/
CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (KCRG) - Saturday was the Made in Iowa Spring Market at Lindale Mall in Cedar Rapids. People could buy homemade creations from over 150 vendors. The market had a special section where vendors 18 and under could set up a booth to sell their works. One of those vendors was Twice As Nice , a business ran by a pair of twins that sell crocheted animals. They say they started the business after they ran out of people in their life to gift their creations to. I like to make up my own patterns sometimes and I like to add details and use different colors, Emily Lovseth made. Lovseth's biggest creation on sale at the market was a $60 crocheted multi-color dragon. It has wire in the wings so you can pose it a little bit. I had to make all these parts and sew them together, she said.

Stoneville men volleyball team. - Advertisement - By Samuel Peters The Antigua and Barbuda Volleyball Association (ABVA) Championship continued on Wednesday evening with contrasting fortunes for Stoneville Volleyball Club across their men's and women's division contests at the JSC Indoor Facility. In Women's Division 1, Stoneville suffered a 3-1 defeat to Starz despite a promising start. The match began with Stoneville edging a tight opening set 25-23, but Starz responded decisively, taking the next three sets 26-24, 25-23, and 25-23 in what proved to be a close encounter. In contrast, Stoneville's men's team, who are titleholders delivered a commanding performance in the evening's second match, sweeping High Flyerz Phoenix 3-0. The straight-sets victory (25-14, 25-22, 25-16) demonstrated Stoneville's dominance, particularly in the opening and closing sets. The results leave both Stoneville teams with mixed emotions as they prepare for their upcoming fixtures this weekend. The women's team will look to bounce back against Dynasty Volleyball on Saturday, while the men's squad aims to build on their momentum when they face Royal Cruisers on Sunday afternoon.

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (WFLA) — A U.S. Coast Guard crew rescued four people from the bay Saturday after their 18-foot boat sank near Bayboro Harbor in St. Petersburg. A photo showed the boaters awaiting rescue while floating in the water. While three of them were wearing life vests, a fourth person without a flotation device could be seen clinging to the other boaters. Authorities said all four people were safely pulled from the water. Two of them were taken on a Pinellas County Sheriff's Office boat to meet up with St. Pete Fire Rescue at St. Pete Municipal Marina.

In tax controversy and litigation matters, sometimes procedure trumps the merits. The statute of limitations is a great example. Even if the taxpayer made a mistake on a prior year return, the IRS generally can't open an audit if the applicable statute of limitations period has expired. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA) has its own statute of limitations rules associated with partnerships. Because the BBA partnership rules are relatively new—they did not go into effect until the 2018 tax year—the rules contain traps for the unwary. Indeed, a recent IRS Chief Counsel memorandum shows that these traps can also ensnare the IRS. The BBA Generally Enacted in 2015, the BBA generally applies to partnership tax returns filed for the 2018 and later years. Under the BBA, the partnership pays income tax (referred to as an imputed underpayment ) by default unless the partnership makes a timely election to have the IRS adjustments pushed out to the partners. In addition to the imputed underpayment rules, the BBA created the partnership representative (PR). The PR has sole authority to act on behalf of the partnership, including executing statute of limitations extension forms and actions related to an IRS examination. Generally, the partnership designates a PR by identifying an eligible entity or individual on the partnership's tax return. After this designation, the PR continues to serve as the representative for that year until the PR resigns, the partnership revokes the designation, or the IRS concludes that the designation is no longer effective (the partnership can designate different PRs for different tax years). The BBA Statute Of Limitations By statute, the BBA requires the IRS to issue three different notices to the partnership and PR related to an examination. First, the agency must issue a notice of administrative proceeding notifying the partnership of the audit. Second, the IRS must issue a notice of proposed partnership adjustment (NOPPA). Third, the IRS must issue a notice of final partnership adjustment (FPA). The BBA also has its own statute of limitations rules. Under the general three-year rule, the agency can't make a partnership adjustment three years after the later of: The date the partnership files its tax return (i.e., Form 1065); The partnership's return filing deadline; The date on which the partnership files an administrative adjustment request (AAR). However, certain events can extend the three-year period. For example, the IRS has 330 days from the NOPPA issuance date to make a partnership adjustment if that date is later than the three-year period above. But the NOPPA is timely only if the IRS issued it within the three-year period. There are numerous exceptions to the statute of limitations period, including the submission of a fraudulent return. In addition, the BBA provides the PR and the IRS with the option of extending the statute of limitations period if the partnership signs a notice in writing, waiving the default statute of limitations period. The Chief Counsel Memorandum In CCA 202505027, the IRS commenced an examination of a BBA partnership income tax return for the 2018 and 2019 tax years. The partnership filed its 2018 return on September 13, 2019, and its 2019 return on September 14, 2020. Thus, under the general three-year rule, the IRS had until September 13, 2022, and September 14, 2023, to propose adjustments to the partnership's 2018 and 2019 tax years, respectively. The facts in the memorandum suggest the IRS examiner needed more time. Accordingly, the agent sought and received signed statute of limitations extensions (i.e., Forms 872-M) from managers of the partnership, including the CFO/Treasurer. These individuals were not, however, PRs of the partnership. On these facts, IRS Chief Counsel concluded that the Forms 872-M were invalid to extend the statute of limitations. In the memorandum, IRS Chief Counsel commented that the PR was the sole individual authorized to extend the statute of limitations for the partnership and therefore the IRS was barred from proposing adjustments to the partnership's 2018 and 2019 tax returns. Conclusion Tax professionals and taxpayers should always keep tax procedure issues top of mind during an IRS audit. As CCA 202505027 shows, sometimes raising the issue alone may be sufficient to successfully defend against proposed adjustments or assessments.|2025-03-16|https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewroberts/2025/03/15/irs-issues-legal-memorandum-on-bba-partnership-statute-of-limitations/
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has scheduled an election to fill the U.S. House seat in Congressional District 7 that had been held by longtime Rep. Raúl Grijalva. The southern Arizona Democrat, who was first elected to Congress in 2002, died Thursday at age 77 of complications from lung cancer treatment. According to the proclamation issued by Hobbs, a primary will take place on July 15, with a general election to follow on Sept. 23. Federal law leaves it to states to determine procedures for filling U.S. House vacancies. Arizona law states if the next regular general election is not to be held within six months from the date of the occurrence of the vacancy, the governor shall call a special primary election to be held 120 to 133 days after the vacancy and a special general election to be held 70 to 80 days after the special primary election. Grijalva's most recent term began in January, and he had announced it would be his last. The next general election for the seat was not scheduled until 2026.|2025-03-16|https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-15/gov-katie-hobbs-sets-election-dates-to-fill-grijalvas-house-seat
HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) — Dozens of people gathered on the steps of the State Capitol Saturday protesting the Trump Presidency. Dubbed the 50-50-1 Movement, for 50 protests and 50 states, it takes place across the country. Demonstrators lined the streets carrying signs and chanting for change. The things that the administration is doing, the attacks against the people, against politics, against the Constitution, are not stopping, T.J. Dementriou, a volunteer, said. They've captured protesters. They've disappeared them. We see no end to what is happening. And the only way to fight that is to keep coming out over and over and let them know what we think.

Benjamin Disraeli advised, Read no history: nothing but biography, for that is life without theory. With Jews in Service to the Tsar, Lev Berdnikov offers us 28 biographies spanning five centuries of Russian Jewish history, and each portrait opens a new window onto the history of Eastern Europe's Jews, illuminating dark corners and challenging widely-held conceptions about the role of Jews in Russian history. The 28 individuals profiled in these pages are bound by a single thread: each served a Russian tsar, emperor, or empress sometime between the fifteenth and nineteenth centuries. Beyond that, they were an exceptionally diverse lot – in addition to businessmen, diplomats, scholars, and doctors, there was a police chief, one of Russia's most effective ministers of finance, and two very different court jesters. Taken together, their influence on the course of Russian history was profound. Berdnikov's book, which has enjoyed considerable popularity in Russia, has been called a weighty document of historical truth, and been acclaimed for its calm impartiality, for the sincerity of the author's voice, and for the depth and breadth of Berdnikov's research into archives and other historical sources that have only recently become accessible. About the Author Lev Berdnikov, a native of Moscow, earned his Ph.D. in eighteenth century literature. He has conducted extensive primary source research into this period of Russian history and others, including during his tenure as a senior researcher at what was then the Lenin Library. He is well known in Russia as a historian with a gift for extracting fascinating but little-known stories from dusty archives and forgotten sources. The author of six books and over 400 essays and articles, Berdinkov received the Gorky Literary Prize for his 2009 book Clowns and Jesters (Shuty i skomorokhi), and in 2010 was honored by the Bulat Okudzhava Cultural Fund for the Americas. Jews in Service to the Tsar is the first of Berdnikov's books to be translated into English. It has been called a weighty document of historical truth that is beautifully written, a book with calm impartiality. Berdnikov has lived in Los Angeles since 1990. He is a member of the Moscow Union of Writers and serves on the editorial committee of the Danish journal New Shore (Novy Bereg). About the Translator Nora Seligman Faorov is an accomplished Russian to English translator. Among her recent published translations is Master of the House: Stalin and His Inner Circle by Oleg Khlevniuk (Yale UP: 2008). She is associate editor of SlavFile, a newsletter for Slavic translators and interpreters, and a frequent translator and contributor to Russian Life magazine and Chtenia, a literary journal of translations from Russian.

The Vallejo and Benicia Toastmasters Clubs, a group dedicated to personal development and public speaking, are coming together Sunday for their first in-person contest since 2020. Toastmasters is an international organization with a goal of helping adults develop their leadership skills and network. For three local chapters, Capitol Speakers from Benicia, Mare Island Toastmasters and NorthBay Speech Masters from Vallejo, contests are an important part of the process. For Chief Judge and Toastmasters member Linda Stewart, joining her local club created an opportunity for career development, when club members encouraged her to apply for a promotion at work. I wasn't going to apply for the job, but someone in my Toastmasters Club encouraged me to apply and I got picked, she said. That job involved mentoring people and running meetings, so if I hadn't been in Toastmasters, I wouldn't have had those skills. The contest includes competition in speech and evaluation, for a total of six participants. Each participant was chosen based on an inter-club contest. The speeches can be on any subject and are evaluated based on factors like grammar, value and voice. Often, the speeches are tailored to the needs of the participant, says Stewart. People come to generally improve their skills, but some people come for specific reasons like they are running for office or applying for new jobs and we will tell them how we can use the program to help, said Stewart. For example, a participant could present a speech on interviewing skills. Stewart says she is looking forward to the in-person aspect of the upcoming contest. I think being in person you make more connections with one another, she said. It's a way to build your confidence because it's not only a supportive environment, people will help you with whatever you're working on.

I had originally planned this update for April, but I finished the update sooner than I expected. So, here we are with the last planned update for the Noob's GRID Graphics Mod! With the rework of Le Mans, this mod is finally complete. But the last planned update doesn't mean this mod is dead or abandoned. I just don't have anything to add anymore, since it does what a graphics mod should and then some. Now it's time for some emotional speech. When I first released this mod in 2022, it was honestly kinda random. At the September of Last year, I started working on it again after 2 years. And somehow this mod snowballed into a popularity that I didn't expected. So, thank you all for your support, I truly appreciated it! [Here is the new stuff with the 4.0 release]: -Reworked the Lighting of the Le Mans circuit -Small lighting rework to Jarama -All of the tracks are polished and fixed for one last time -New bonus content: Extra depth of field effects -New bonus content: Yokohama ProStreet Lighting [Reworked Le Mans] Le Mans was the final piece for the complete version of this mod. And it's here with a new glorious look! Here is the full day night cycle of Circuit de la Sarthe! Le Mans [Track Fixes] I learned how to mod the game's lighting as I go, you could say I was a noob (haha). So I left some small oversights here and there. Like incorrect smoke color (Thanks cyborg009). A consequence of this, I realised my old interpretation of the Jarama lighting was wrong because of incorrect sky brightness. Now it's more faithful to the original. Yokohamaf GRID13 [New Bonus Content] Going with the theme of copying other games's looks, I added Yokohama ProStreet Lighting . It creplicates the look of Tokyo Docks from Need for Speed ProStreet. Yokohama ProStreet But I think the main event is the Extra Depth of field effects . I toyed with the idea at my DIRT Graphics Mod, but scrapped it due being useless and horrible. I was going to scrap it for this mod too, but I found great uses for it! And from what I saw, this is the first time it's used like that in a mod, let's take a look!

Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition The new HOPE VI development named 810 East Broadway held an official ribbon cutting yesterday. We've told you about the building all through construction and gave you a tour of the building last week, but the rest of the news came on board today with fresh coverage after the press event. Some news outlets labeled the 22-unit mixed-use building a housing project. We feel this term isn't appropriate for describing the future of public housing in Louisville. Housing projects are what we're replacing. The old Clarksdale Homes (pictured above) were torn down to create the mixed-use, mixed-income Liberty Green development. 810 East Broadway is part of that transformation. While the building does have sub-market rate apartments, it's part of a new approach to public housing called scattered site development where small numbers of units occur all throughout the city. The term housing project, for us at least, still carries a negative stigma from the 20th century equivalent and isn't constructive to describe the new nature of these developments, especially 810 East Broadway. 1 of 8 Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Â'Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Â'Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Â'Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition Â'Clarksdale Housing Project Just Before Demolition But it's really all just word play. This is a development project and it includes housing. Housing project. So, you could suppose that Waterfront Park Place or the Fleur-de-Lis on Main, or Lake Forest subdivision for that matter are all housing projects. But they don't get headlines that read City opens new housing project from Fox 41. Most were more sensitive. The C-J simply called it public housing or an apartment complex while Wave 3 says it's a housing complex for working families. WFPL had the best headline reading New Housing Development Opened Downtown. It gets to the point without allowing stereotypes to fester beneath stigmatized words. And it generates the most excitement. This is a new housing development in a beautiful new building that is one of the most contextually sensitive in Louisville. The city should be excited there's 22 new housing units near downtown and over 3,000 square feet of new market rate retail space on Broadway. This building will be great for the city. The design of the structure (by Kersey & Kersey Architects) may have been a little too good, though. Apparently 810 East Broadway blends so well with its historic surroundings, Wave 3 thought it was a renovation: The 801 East Broadway building at the corner of Shelby and East Broadway has been completely renovated to provide 16 one-bedroom apartments as well as six two-bedroom apartments. It's like the building has been here all along. Are we concerned about nothing or do you agree 810 East Broadway isn't a housing project? Even Mayor Abramson was delighted that we've progressed from warehousing the poor in barracks. Your thoughts in the comments.|2025-03-16|https://brokensidewalk.com/2009/what-is-a-housing-project/
Ramy creator and star Ramy Youssef has given a promising update on the chances of a fourth season of Hulu's hit comedy-drama. The show sees Youssef playing the titular character, an American-Muslim man who tries to navigate his faith and lifestyle in modern-day New Jersey. Ramy season 1 debuted on Hulu in 2019 with 10 episodes. The series has so far run three seasons and 30 episodes, earning critical acclaim for its positive portrayal of Muslims in the West, with Youssef earning a Golden Globe Award for his performance. In an interview with ScreenRant at SXSW on the #1 Happy Family USA red carpet, Youssef talked about the possibility of Ramy returning for a fourth season. He responded positively when asked about the chances of more Ramy in the future, indicating that another season might happen at some point, but he doesn't know when. Nevertheless, he remains optimistic about the Hulu series continuing in the future. Check out Youssef's comments on the matter below: Yes. We're hoping to do another season at some point—I just don't know when. But we're hoping, for sure. What These Comments Mean For The Chances Of Ramy Season 4 It Feels Inevitable The Show Will Return For At Least One More Season The chances of Ramy season 4 getting a renewal seem pretty likely, and Youssef's comments, while non-committal, are promising. The critical success of the show, including its 94% critical Rotten Tomatoes score, coupled with its strong storytelling and successful run on Hulu, means there is certainly still an appetite for the story and the issues it explores. It has been over two years since the Ramy season 3 finale, so any renewal would depend on Hulu's interest, and Youssef's schedule. While the success of the show to date has been strong, its future will largely depend on its star and the narrative direction he wishes to take. Nothing is known yet about the possible narrative direction that Ramy season 4 could take, but there are plenty of plot threads that could be explored. There are many unanswered questions from Ramy season 3 that will need to be revisited and concluded, especially if season 4 marks the end of the series. These will no doubt inform story arcs for the new season, as the show will likely seek to set Ramy on the path to a redemption arc that will conclude the series. Our Take On What Ramy Season 4 Could Look Like It Looks Like It Could Be The Final Run For The Series While the success of the show to date has been strong, its future will largely depend on its star and the narrative direction he wishes to take. It seems as though Youssef has a plan for season 4, and his hopeful update suggests that scheduling will be the crux of the matter here. Provided the cast and crew of Ramy can find time to reunite, there's every chance Ramy season 4 will happen sooner rather than later.|2025-03-16|https://screenrant.com/ramy-season-4-update-ramy-youssef/
image_2024-10-22_153417955 / Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC with youth leaders at the closing session of the Commonwealth Youth Forum - Advertisement - In Samoa, an energised and committed group of over 350 young leaders from 56 Commonwealth countries today concluded two days of deliberations on the pivotal role of youth in steering the Commonwealth towards a resilient and sustainable future. The closing ceremony was as vibrant as the voices of the youth who shared, debated and opined throughout the forum. A stirring rendition from a 70-piece orchestra, spirited speeches expressing gratitude and awards for contribution to youth were highlights of the closing ceremony. Government ministers, senior officials and other stakeholders were there to encourage and listen to the young people share their perspectives. The Commonwealth Youth Forum (CYF), held from October 21-22, 2024, just days ahead of the bi-annual Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), produced a strong declaration which prioritises young people as key actors in decision-making and will serve as a blueprint for countries in the Commonwealth to make significant progress in achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. This year's forum marked some other significant milestones: Over 50 years of the Commonwealth Youth Programme (CYP) that funds youth empowerment programmes and initiatives; The 10 th anniversary of the Commonwealth Youth Council (CYC) – the official voice of youth in the Commonwealth; and The culmination of the Commonwealth Year of Youth – a focused period dedicated to youth-led action for sustainable and inclusive development. The Transformative Power of Youth Leadership The forum was convened by the Government of Samoa, the Commonwealth Secretariat, the CYC and the CYF International Taskforce under the theme Navigating Our Course: Building Resilience for a Common Future, Matimatiga for a Stronger Future . The closing ceremony featured the installation ceremony of the newly elected executive members of the CYC. Head of Social Policy Development at the Commonwealth Secretariat, Layne Robinson, noted that, for the first time, men outnumbered women on the executive, a testament to the efforts to close the gender gap. Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland, KC lauded the new CYC in recognition and challenged them to the huge burden they have now taken on. You are worthy , she assured the past and future CYC executive. She also said: The world is looking to you, the youth of the Commonwealth, to be the change-makers, the champions of a more sustainable, just, and equitable world. You have the power to push boundaries, challenge norms, and lead in ways that previous generations could not. The Chair, Samoa National Youth Council Leiataualesā Kevin Lucky, said: It has been a challenging yet humbling journey being the Co-Chair of the International Task Force for the Commonwealth Youth Forum. Moreover, it has enabled me to work with different amazing young talents and leaders locally, particularly our Task Force and across the Commonwealth. I am truly honoured. Speaking on the vital role of youth as co-creators in sustainable development, the newly-elected Chairperson of the Commonwealth Youth Council Joshua Opey, said: I look forward to working with all stakeholders to bring a renewed commitment to meaningful youth engagement and deliver tangible solutions for 1.5 billion young people across the Commonwealth. We need immediate action on youth involvement at all levels to guarantee prosperity. The CYC will work relentlessly to ensure young people are engaged and involved as we strive for a resilient common future. During the forum, delegates and speakers from across the Commonwealth highlighted the need to create platforms for youth participation in governance.

Carli Judice earned her first win inside the octagon and she did so in style. On Saturday, Judice squared off with UFC debutant Yuneisy Duben in the opening bout of UFC Vegas 104, and it didn't take long for Crispy to get the job done as she stopped her fellow Contender Series product with a head kick in just 100 seconds. Duben entered the UFC off of one of the nastiest knockouts ever on Contender Series, but was unable to have similar success against Judice, who stormed out from the opening bell and put it on Duben with a high-volume attack. Ultimately, Judice found a home for her left high kick early in the round, flooring Duben. The win moves Judice to 4-2 as a professional and stops the two-fight skid she was on, having lost both her Contender Series tryout and her UFC debut by split decision.

31_32_SS_Israel_Militarize_Police • Zionist groups want to turn U.S. cops into trained killers. By Ronald L. Ray — It is no secret that law enforcement in recent decades has changed in the United States. The increasing surveillance and violence employedagainst peaceful citizens, including children, is well documented. Gone is the friendly cop on the beat, replaced by militarized officersdressed in black, lacking identifying badges, who are trained to shoot first rather than seekpeaceful de-escalation of conflict and minimal use of force. A key reason, carefully obscured by mainstreampresstitutes, is the growing number of American police either trained in Israel or in America with the same Israeli methods of pacification employed against Palestinians. The U.S.- and Israeli-sponsored false-flag terror attacks of September 11, 2001 opened the floodgates to exploitation and profiteering by the greedy military-industrial-security complex, both in America and Israel. Arms manufacturers and training consultantshave sought every opportunity to expand their clientele, and this includes local and state law enforcement and various federal agencies. It is true that the Israelis are not the only influence contributing to growing police brutality and killings of suspects. The Pentagon's ExcessProperty Program, or 1033 program, which encourages state, county, and local law enforcement topurchase surplus U.S. military and paramilitary equipment at minimal cost, also results in an If you have it, use it mentality—just what the defense industry ordered. But it is likewise no accident that police inAmerica increasingly are equipped and behave identically to Israeli occupation forces in the stateof Palestine. The manufacturers and suppliers are often the same. The training is also increasingly the same. Andwhile the numbers of law enforcement officials actually sent to Israel seem small—typically underreportedas at least 300 —that is only the tip of the iceberg. The key numbers are significantly higher.High enough, indeed, that William A. Jacobson at the Legal Insurrection website wrote a July 18, 2016, hasbara piece, claiming the matter is just a conspiracy theory with anti-Israel and anti-Semitic roots. Is he worried the truth is getting out? Apparently the state of Israel is worried. Itsembassy declined to respond to AMERICAN FREE PRESS's questions about the matter. Jacobson zeroes in on a key whistleblower, MaxBlumenthal, using typical Zionist disinformation and misdirection techniques to try to undermine thelatter's devastating December 2011 exposé of the Israelification of American domestic security. In 2007, Israeli dual-citizen and then-Secretary ofHomeland Security Michael Chertoff ordered U.S.-Israeli cooperation and cross-training in security and counter-terrorism efforts. But it was already well underway. WarriorCopRS Softcover, 352 pages Buy Book Button Blumenthal quotes Karen Greenberg, the directorof Fordham School of Law's Center on National Security: After 9-11 . . . [t]he training in Iraq andAfghanistan on torture was Israeli training. There's been a huge downside to taking our cue from theIsraelis and now we're going to spread that into the fabric of everyday American life? Immediately after 9-11, the Jewish Institute forNational Security Affairs (JINSA) fostered training in Israel of leading U.S. police and security officials.The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and the American Jewish Committee's Project Interchange have since also joined the list of private organizations Contributing, both financially and logistically, to the Israelification of all levels of law enforcement. Blumenthal continues, Through its Law Enforcement Education Program (LEEP), JINSA claims to have arranged Israeli-led training sessions for over9,000 American law enforcement officials at the federal, state, and municipal level. That's significantlymore than 300, and sufficient to have a major national impact when the trainees pass on the dubious skills to their departments. Many examples of police brutality, in fact, show this influence, as officers have adopted the violent, painful methods of Israeli martial arts employedby the Zionist occupation government to subdue Palestinians. JINSA-Israeli training was at the heartof police cruelty to protestors in the Occupy Wall Street movement. Not to be outdone, Through the ADL's AdvancedTraining School course on Extremist and Terrorist Threats, over 700 law enforcement personnelfrom 220 federal and local agencies including the FBI and CIA have been trained by Israeli police and intelligence commanders, writes Blumenthal. That's not all. The ADL's David C. Friedman crowed to The Jerusalem Post in September 2015 that they come back and they are Zionists. Clearly,there is propaganda akin to brainwashing at work, too. The ADL claims, In 2010 alone, wetrained more than 10,500 law enforcement officers from all over the country. They also have indoctrinated over 70,000 law enforcement personnel in lessons of the Holocaust. Given those numbers, it should be no surprisethat innocent citizens are too often treated as enemies by police and Homeland Security officials,subjected to the same militaristic brutalization by law enforcement officers as Israel metes out to nearly defenseless Palestinians. From New York to Los Angeles, Chicago to Dallas, and Detroit to Atlanta to Miami, as well as in countless smaller cities and counties, American andIsraeli Zionists have turned police into an occupation army ready to oppress U.S. citizens. One brave soul posted an important petition at WhiteHouse.gov, requesting a federal ban on police training by the war-criminal state of Israel. It is wellworthy of support, but it can only be symbolic: too little and too late. Donate to us / Support AFP|2025-03-16|https://americanfreepress.net/an-army-of-u-s-occupation/
ISTANBUL Former Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon on Saturday accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stalling the second phase of the ceasefire and hostages-prisoner exchange deal with Hamas to appease far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. The 42-day first phase of the truce expired on March 2 following several prisoners-for-hostages exchanges. The second phase, which is meant to negotiate a permanent end to the fighting in Gaza, including the return of all remaining captives and the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory, is yet to begin. In a statement, Ya'alon said Netanyahu is delaying the implementation of the second phase of the agreement with Hamas to prevent Smotrich from dismantling his coalition, which is essential to keeping Netanyahu in power. Ya'alon said Smotrich prefers resuming military operations in Gaza over proceeding with negotiations, even if it means abandoning Israeli captives. He warned that the finance minister is using coalition threats to pressure Netanyahu into rejecting further negotiations with Hamas. The former minister said US officials have grown frustrated with Netanyahu's stalling tactics and have begun direct negotiations with Hamas. The Americans are now working on securing the release of hostages with US citizenship, Ya'alon said, suggesting Washington is bypassing Israeli leadership to advance the negotiations. He called for Netanyahu's removal, describing his government as corrupt and blaming it for prolonging the hostage crisis.

Denmark's Holger Rune beat Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-4 to reach the Indian Wells ATP Masters final on Saturday, denying the Russian world number six a third straight trip to the title match. Rune, ranked 13th, snapped a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals and will face either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Britain's Jack Draper on Sunday. It means everything, Rune said. The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing. Playing Daniil is one of the toughest challenges for me on tour. I obviously had the right tactics, but it was still so difficult because he puts in great effort and is super solid. In a rematch of last year's quarter-finals, the 21-year-old Rune showed admirable discipline against the Medvedev's vaunted defense, sticking in the rallies and keeping the Russian off balance with a variety of shots while making judicious use of his powerful forehand. After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes. He gained the decisive break for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev. The second set was a more straightforward affair after Rune broke Medvedev at love for a 2-1 lead. After two nervy points as he served for the match, Rune rallied from 0-30 down and survived another mammoth rally to give himself a match point, punctuating the victory with a forehand winner. It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got good leg work, so I can reach many balls, Rune said. It's about finding the right pace and which shots to hit, because so many players miss too many shots against Daniil. He makes you go for more, so I'm super proud that I managed to find the right rhythm. Rune, whose ascent has slowed since he burst on the scene in 2022 with a victory over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final, reached his first tour-level final since Brisbane in January of 2024. bb/sev|2025-03-16|https://www.sanfordherald.com/news/national/rune-shocks-medvedev-to-reach-indian-wells-atp-final/article_1e19aa69-8fc3-5d8e-8af9-7822fa3bc506.html
The time of her disappearance was about 12:10 p.m. March 18, 1965, and to this day, despite massive efforts by state police from the Hollidaysburg Barracks, there has not been one clue as to what happened to the 6-year-old. Her father, Jim Shea, a supervisor at a nearby paper mill, stated in a 2005 interview that he came home for lunch that day and offered to drive his daughter to the school, which was only two blocks from the Shea home. No dad, I like walking in the snow, she told him. She was certainly dressed for the cool, late-winter afternoon, by her mother, Mary Alice Shea. Kathy, described as bright yet contemplative, left home wearing a dark brown hat, a coat with a fur collar, a red sweater, red tights and very large, bright yellow boots with distinctive black soles — what investigators described as a bumblebee design. She was returning to school after having her tonsils removed and after experiencing a bout of chickenpox. Her route from her home on West 14th Street was to North Avenue and then to West 15th Street, where a retired school guard talked to her. A neighborhood parent also talked to her and twins named Sylvia and Martha saw her at North Avenue and 16th Street. When they looked again, Kathy was no longer there. Police brought in bloodhounds, which tracked Kathy to North Avenue and Garfield Street. Investigators believe at that point, she entered a vehicle but they were never able to obtain a detailed description of a vehicle seen in the area that day (only that it was worn ) and that there were reports of man who had, a few months before, asked a patrol boy to point out Kathy Shea. A man of similar description was seen in the area the day before Kathy's disappearance. When Kathy didn't show up for class, her teacher, Judy Norris, was not alarmed, noting that Kathy had recently been ill. But when she didn't return home late that afternoon, a massive search ensued. It included young and old alike. Gov. Bill Scranton activated the National Guard. The streets were searched. Garbage cans throughout the borough were scanned — although one young searcher complained that she was never given a description of what Kathy was wearing that day, only that authorities were looking for the body of a young girl. The search extended to neighboring counties. Many who experienced the devastating emotion and subsequent non-resolution of Kathy Shea's disappearance are now deceased. They include: the lead investigator from the state police, Fred Leamer; Altoona Mirror reporter, Vergie Werner, who lived next door to the Shea family and who spent that first night with the family; and Cary Simpson, the widely known and respected owner of radio station WTRN. In past interviews, Leamer said, I'll probably go to my grave wondering what happened. … You never forget. Werner remembered how she and Mary Alice laughed and cried together many times talking about Kathy. Simpson said what happened to Kathy was horrible … I think people after a while just feel sad. Still a 'scar' But while Kathy Shea's disappearance occurred two generations ago, her case continues to cry out for resolution, because people want to know what happened. Freelance writer Lloyd Rogers, who lives in the Tyrone area, said he has written about the case and in a recent note sent to the Altoona Mirror, he stated, Kathy's story isn't just a local mystery; it's a scar that never healed. Tyrone Mayor William Latchford in a recent interview sums up the feelings of local residents, stating, Kathy's disappearance was a loss to the community. Back then, we didn't have to worry about our children. People looked out for each other, he said. Then he vowed, This town is not ready to give up on Kathy Shea yet. We are all still wondering what happened and want closure at some point, he said. Latchford went on to explain how impressed he has been with the State Police in Hollidaysburg for their tenaciousness and their awesome dedication to bringing resolution to the case. The present day cold case trooper on the Kathy Shea case is Dana Martini. She did not want to discuss the ongoing investigation except to say that when leads continue to come in, they are investigated. She also hesitated to talk about any recent developments, noting she wanted to protect the integrity of the overall investigation. Many troopers have worked on the case over the years, including Leamer, who at one point was named State Police Officer of the Year; Troopers Thomas Semelsberger, David Aiello and Terry Summers. Trooper Barry S. Bidelspach, an experienced investigator, promised Leamer that he would continue to pursue the Shea disappearance after Leamer retired. Bidelspach, even into his own retirement, continued the search for clues that would resolve the case, and just prior to his death in 2019, at age 82, was still pursuing interviews in the case. Another Tyrone resident who is seeking closure is Judy Norris, Kathy's kindergarten teacher. Norris was in her first year of teaching. She is now retired and is a community leader in Tyrone, but admitted that every year at this time, It comes back. She, like Latchford, is not giving up. I do think there is hope, she said. But, as for now, she stated, I can't add anything to it. It's not like the police didn't do their job. They did, she concluded. Then she made the point, If there is progress today, it will be through technology. Technology assist Back in 1965 when Kathy went missing, there was no internet, and the phenomenon unleashed by the use of DNA was still 24 years in the future, but it is through the development of these technologies that offer a sliver of hope that could provide answers to the mystery of Kathy Shea's disappearance and could determine if she may still be alive. Martini indicated that state police are aware of the use of Ancestry DNA in locating people through the DNA of relatives and comparing that to people of similar ethnicity, or ancestral journeys, but, she explained, police need something to compare to the DNA characteristics of the Shea family, which they don't have. However, the use of ancestry DNA was used this past year in a case that is eerily similar to the Kathy Shea disappearance, to not only locate a man who had been kidnapped in 1951, but who was found alive, living on the East Coast. According to news reports published last September in the Oakland, Calf., Mercury News and the Los Angeles Times, Luis Armando Albino was 6 years old when he and an older brother were playing in an Oakland park near his family's home. A woman came to the park and offered to buy the youngster a piece of candy. She then took him and flew him to the East Coast, where she gave the child to the couple who eventually raised him. In 2020, a niece, Alida Alequin, knowing the trauma that the youngster's disappearance had caused the family, just for fun took a DNA test which, according to the news reports, resulted in a 22% match to a man on the East Coast. She had a feeling that the man could be her long-lost uncle. She and her own family members began an internet search for the man. The Oakland Police Department and the FBI assisted in the search and the man was eventually located. Another DNA test indicated he was the lost uncle. Albino was reunited with his relatives, including the older brother he was with the day of his kidnapping. He remembered being taken from the park, but did not want to talk to the media. News reports indicated Albino was a Marine Corps veteran, having served two tours in Vietnam, a retired firefighter, a father and grandfather. In his 2005 interview, Jim Shea mentioned his hope that Kathy was still alive. A lot of times, he said, I get to thinking 'what did happen to Kathy?' He then added that he hoped whoever kidnapped her did not take her life, but instead wanted a child to raise. Maybe, he hoped, Kathy grew up in a good home.|2025-03-16|https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-news/2025/03/still-missing-despite-few-leads-tyrone-not-ready-to-give-up/
The Memphis Grizzlies will play the second game of a back-to-back set on Saturday night when they host the Miami Heat. The Grizzlies (42-25) are coming off a 133-124 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers that snapped the team's four-game winning streak. As for the Heat (29-37), they're coming off a far greater disappointment. Miami dropped its sixth straight game, 103-91 to the Boston Celtics on Friday. The Heat will attempt to recover against the Grizzlies, but they'll have to be more productive than they were at home against the Celtics. Miami was tied with Boston at the half and trailed by only one entering the fourth quarter. But the Heat scored only 14 points in the final frame. We played and competed hard, like visually that's what I want to see every single day, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. We've been doing that, not really in the Clippers game (a 119-104 loss on Wednesday), but we've been doing it. Against most teams, that's probably going to give yourself a better chance down the stretch. Against Boston, it's going to be a double-digit loss. It's been a difficult recent stretch for Spoelstra. Since February, his team has been outscored by 126 points in the fourth quarter. No other NBA team has been as unproductive in the final period during that stretch. Andrew Wiggins had 23 points on Friday and Tyler Herro had 19 points and six assists. Spoelstra attempted to reverse the team's fortunes with a lineup change against Boston. The Heat had started Wiggins, Herro, Davion Mitchell, Kel'el Ware and Bam Adebayo in the previous three games, but Spoelstra inserted Duncan Robinson for Mitchell and Jaime Jaquez Jr. for Ware on Friday. Adebayo, Wiggins and Herro remained starters. Robinson, who scored in double figures in nine straight games off the bench, was limited to six points in 26 minutes against Boston. Despite Robinson's struggles, Spoelstra said the new starting five was pretty fluid all the way through. For the Grizzlies, they welcomed All-Star forward Jaren Jackson Jr. back on Friday after he missed the team's previous four games with a left ankle injury. Jackson had 13 points, four steals and two blocks in his return. Ja Morant led the Grizzlies with a season-high 44 points against Cleveland, which won its 16th straight game. He has scored 20 or more points in 10 straight games and has been particularly productive during the past five games by averaging 32.8 points. Memphis coach Taylor Jenkins said the Grizzlies made matters difficult by allowing 75 points in the first half vs. Cleveland, including 13 makes from beyond the arc. We could have been a lot better defensively, Jenkins said. We dug ourselves a huge hole. We had a much better effort in the third and fourth quarters. We needed that in the first two quarters against the best team in the NBA. I'm disappointed we didn't come in with that frame of mind. We were playing catch-up all night.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/grizzlies-bid-to-bounce-back-vs-skidding-heat/
At least 26 dead in massive US storm after Kansas reports 8 fatalities The Storm Prediction Center designated the day as high risk for severe weather, especially in the Deep South. Destruction from a severe storm is seen Saturday, March 15, 2025, in Wayne County, Mo. Credit: Jeff Roberson, AP OKLAHOMA CITY — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. It was a very rough deal last night, he said Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night. Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March.

Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. The amount of damage was catastrophic, Dillon said. It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over -- everything was destroyed. Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. Homes and everything were destroyed all around it, she said. Schools and buildings are just completely gone. Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral.

Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it's here. It's here, Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ... His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. ___ Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey.

Donald Trump has invoked a rare act to speed up mass deportations of illegal migrants. Photo: AP PHOTO Donald Trump has invoked a rare act to speed up mass deportations of illegal migrants.

In invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, Trump said members of the gang were conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States , with the goal of destabilising the country. Trump campaigned heavily on a promise to deport millions of immigrants living in the US illegally. (AP PHOTO) Trump campaigned heavily on a promise to deport millions of immigrants living in the US illegally. (AP PHOTO) The act, which has only been used in times of war, could allow the president to bypass the due process rights of migrants categorised as threats and rapidly deport them. While the proclamation was released by the White House on Saturday, the wording suggests Trump signed it on Friday. Under Trump's proclamation, all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are found to be members of the gang, are within the US, and are not naturalised or lawful permanent residents of the country are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies . The Alien Enemies Act is best known for its use to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during World War Two. Civil rights groups and some Democrats have criticised the idea of reviving it to fuel mass deportations and the move will likely trigger legal challenges. The Trump administration in February designated Tren de Aragua, the Sinaloa Cartel and six other criminal groups as global terrorist organisations. Saturday's directive said that Tren de Aragua has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens . Trump made the threat posed by the gang a regular feature of his campaign speeches as evidence of what he called a spike in migrant crime . His action came as a federal judge on Saturday temporarily blocked the US government from deporting five Venezuelans after two non-profit groups sued saying invocation of the act would be illegal as it has only been a power invoked in a time of war, and plainly only applies to warlike actions . The court granted a temporary restraining order, stopping the government from deporting them for 14 days. The American Civil Liberties Union, one of the groups that brought the suit, said the Venezuelans are seeking asylum. Court papers show the government has appealed the judge's temporary restraining order. Trump returned to the White House on January 20, vowing to deport millions of immigrants living in the US illegally. with AP|2025-03-16|https://www.merimbulanewsweekly.com.au/story/8917740/trump-invokes-wartime-powers-to-target-venezuelan-gangs/?cs=14264
Personality Don Geronimo, who was terminated from his morning show on iHeartMedia's Big 100 (WBIG) in Washington DC, has announced that he's no longer under contract and is returning to radio soon. Geronimo's firing was the result of inappropriate comments aimed at WUSA-TV sports reporter Sharla McBride. Geronimo first posted on X on September 28, I am thru contractual issues and ready to get back to work! Available Oct 1st, please DM me if interested. #radiolife Then on Monday, October 2, he said, Best day I've had since July 27. Return to the radio is imminent. Thx Stay tuned. An announcement of his new radio home should come early next week. The incident occurred in July while both were broadcasting from the Washington Commanders training camp. Geronimo's comments towards McBride were considered derogatory and led to his immediate dismissal from the station. Geronimo has since apologized, stating that he deeply regrets his words and their impact on McBride. In response, McBride conveyed her disappointment and embarrassment, emphasizing that no professional should have to face such disrespect in the workplace. Following the incident, the Washington Commanders decided to prohibit both Geronimo and his fellow radio personality, Crash Young, from broadcasting from the team's training camp.|2025-03-16|https://radioink.com/2023/10/04/don-geronimo-to-announce-his-new-radio-home-next-week/
Out of all the places where punk rock found its roots in the United States, Washington, D.C. is one that stands out. Plenty of music genres were bolstered by the passionate musicians and fans in the area. But punk music is one genre that is still closely associated with D.C. today, as well as its natural evolution into hardcore. And we have Ian MacKaye to thank for that. Videos by American Songwriter California was another place in the US where punk was turning into hardcore. However, Washington D.C. was the most notable area where that transformation was taking place. It makes sense why. Much of hardcore, especially its early iterations, took the punk rock formula and made it even more political and culturally diverse. What's a more politically charged and diverse place than D.C.? Punk could have easily disappeared from D.C., though. Bad Brains, the most notable act from the area, packed up and moved to New York in the early 1980s. A teenaged Ian MacKaye, who was playing with the band Teen Idles at the time, saw an opportunity for positive change. He wanted to keep the scene alive and started looking at what could be fixed. The biggest problem in the early 1980s D.C. scene was that bands didn't have much in the way of physical media to sell to fans. If punk and hardcore bands couldn't find a way to get fans to listen to their music outside of live shows, the scene would die off. So, MacKaye founded the record label Dishcord Records. How Ian MacKaye Saved the D.C. Hardcore Scene from Extinction MacKaye made it clear that any money the label made would go toward other bands on the label. It was a community-driven effort that worked. They stationed their operations in a tiny house where they produced records for local hardcore bands to sell to fans. Guy Picciotto of Fugazi said that move was a massively important one for young hardcore artists in D.C. Kids releasing music demystified the process, but, because it was such a statement, the object was heightened, said Picciotto. It felt different to hold that record. Hardcore was still threatening to die off in D.C., though. MacKaye's other band, Minor Threat, had disbanded. However, some musicians kept it alive. Now-famous rock music icons like Henry Rollins and the band Rites Of Spring saw Dischord Records as a hub of sorts for change. The political landscape of the mid-1980s was also radically changing, and more people were doing their best to purge the hardcore scene of racists and thugs left over from punk's darker corners. Modern-day independent labels should look to Dischord for inspiration. They were radically anti-establishment, pro-women, pro-peace, and kept hardcore from being turned into an ugly and exclusive iteration of punk rock. And even though MacKaye was at the forefront, he said himself that it was a community effort. I realized I'm bolstered by the trust of hundreds of people, Ian MacKaye once said. They entrusted Dischord with the caretaking of this music and I have a custodial responsibility. Everything is less now, in terms of sales, but music will never die.|2025-03-16|https://americansongwriter.com/how-ian-mackaye-saved-hardcore-music-in-d-c/
President Donald Trump announced that he's ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen in a post shared on his Truth Social account Saturday (March 15). Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote. The president then directly threatened the Houthi rebels, writing, YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he added, while also warning Iran to cease its support of the group immediately. Trump also took aim at former President Joe Biden's past handling of the Houthi rebels following their attack on American warships in the Red Sea. Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden, he wrote. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.|2025-03-16|https://wrko.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-trump-orders-powerful-airstrike-attack/
BENGALURU: With the gold smuggling racket involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao getting murkier by the day as three central investigation agencies keep digging deeper, Karnataka government on Saturday ordered DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao, her father, to go on 'compulsory leave'. Ranya was reportedly being escorted by a police constable deployed for protocol services extended to IPS officers when she was intercepted by DRI sleuths at Bengaluru airport while trying to smuggle in 14.2 kg gold from Dubai on March 3. The constable, during questioning, revealed he had standing instructions to receive Ranya whenever she returned from her foreign trips, and that he had no idea of gold being smuggled in. Ranya Rao rules out father's involvement in gold smuggling Sources said state govt directed DGP (Karnataka Police Housing Corporation) Ramachandra Rao to go on leave in a bid to avoid any possible embarrassment, with CBI and ED now on the case of gold smuggling racket involving Kannada actor Ranya Rao, citing national security concerns. The senior IPS officer is likely to be summoned by the central agencies for questioning next week, sources added. Meanwhile, Ranya has written to DRI's additional director general, through chief superintendent of Bengaluru Central Prison, ruling out her father's involvement in the gold smuggling case, & claiming she was being falsely implicated. In the five-page letter, dated March 6, she alleged she was roughed up and threatened. I was apprehended from inside the aircraft and arrested without being given an opportunity to explain. From the time of my apprehension to being produced in court, I was hit and slapped on the face at least 10-15 times by officials whom I can identify. One of them said if I didn't sign the documents prepared by them, they would expose my father's name and identity, despite knowing he was not involved, the letter stated. Ranya further said owing to immense pressure and physical assault, she was forced to sign 50-60 typed pages and around 40 blank pages, and that no mahazar was ever conducted, unlike what was claimed. Some persons from Delhi, said to be officers, clearly wanted to shield some other passengers and falsely implicated me, her letter said.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ranya-raos-dad-an-officer-of-dgp-rank-sent-on-forced-leave/articleshow/119059300.cms

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://kfan.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

In fact, many of the cars you laud for Japanese reliability or European build quality are likely assembled elsewhere. With that in mind, let's breakdown where Australia's best-selling vehicles are actually produced. Ford Ranger Australia's favourite vehicle is manufactured in a variety of different locations, including South Africa, Argentina, and the United States, depending on the market in which the Ranger is sold. Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made However, the main production hub resides in Rayong, Thailand. Ford's Thai manufacturing plant produces Ranger models for the Asia-Pacific, Australia, and Europe, as well as parts of Africa and the Middle East. Among the Ranger vehicles built at the Rayong production facility is the Raptor flagship. However, the upcoming Ranger PHEV will come here from Ford's Silverton plant in Pretoria, South Africa, where the Volkswagen Amarok is also exclusively produced. Ford Australia sold a total of 62,593 Rangers in 2024 – making it the first Blue Oval model since the EB and ED Falcon (1992/93) to claim back-to-back national sales victories. Designed and developed in Australia alongside its Everest SUV sibling, the latest generation Ranger was released in 2022 and is offered in a wide variety of body styles and (so far) four powertrains, including single- and twin-turbo 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesels and a 3.0-litre V6 turbo-diesel. Pricing ranges from $36,880 before on-road costs for the base XL single-cab/chassis, up to $90,440 plus on-roads for the high-performance 3.0-litre twin-turbo petrol V6-powered Raptor.

Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made Global production centres around the Toyota production hub in Aichi, Japan, more specifically the Tahara and Takaoka production plants. All Australian RAV4 models are built in Japan. Sold over five generations since 1994 (with a sixth to come soon), the RAV4 generated 58,718 sales for Toyota in Australia last year, making it our most popular SUV and the country's favourite mid-sized SUV, as well usurping the HiLux to become the brand's top-seller for the first time. All models are powered by a 2.5-litre four-cylinder hybrid drivetrain, after the remaining petrol-only variants were discontinued in 2024. Nine RAV4 grades are available across five different trim levels, with a starting price of $42,260 before on-road costs for the front-wheel drive RAV4 Hybrid GX. Interested in buying a Toyota RAV4?

Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made Where Australia's 10 most popular cars are made The Australian-market HiLux is manufactured at the Japanese giant's Samrong plant in Samut Prakan province, Thailand, as has been the case since 1975.

Toyota recorded 53,499 HiLux deliveries in Australia last year, significantly more than the country's fourth best-seller. Four engines are offered across the local range, all with four cylinders and three being turbo-diesels. Pricing ranges from $26,475 to $74,310 before on-road costs.

The manufacturer offers 26 individual variants in Australia, with the off-road ready Blade and X-Terrain sitting at the top of the range.

All Corolla variants – not including the high-performance GR Corolla – are powered by a 1.8-litre naturally aspirated four-cylinder petrol-electric powertrain producing a combined power output of 103kW. Approximately one year ago, Toyota transitioned to a hybrid-only Corolla lineup in Australia. Pricing starts from $32,110 before on-road costs for the Ascent Sport Hybrid hatch and extends to $40,260 before on-road costs for the ZR Hybrid sedan. Interested in buying a Toyota Corolla?

If you're shopping in the car market for a used car, you should check out some of the models Toyota has put out over the years. Toyota is on a solid run in the automotive world, more importantly with its hybrid lineup. Ironically, Toyota offers more hybrids than its non-electric models (ICE). Honda and Toyota were the first car brands to mass-produce a hybrid, with Honda's Insight and Toyota's Prius. With a headstart back in the early 2000s, it only makes sense that Toyota would offer competitive hybrids over the years that practically last a lifetime. There are many benefits to buying a used car, with the largest being the discounted prices due to depreciation. This is the case for many car brands, but Toyota vehicles seem to hold its value better than others. This is because the Japanese car brand is the best when it comes to resale value. Toyota's slow depreciation is ideal for original owners, but just because it doesn't drop significantly in price doesn't mean it's not a steal. This two-year-old Toyota hybrid still fetches an affordable price and carries over Toyota's iconic reliability. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Toyota and other authoritative sources, including the EPA, ConsumerReports, KellyBlueBook, CarandDriver, and J.D. Power. 2023 Corolla Hybrid Side Shot Related Toyota's iconic reliability is seen throughout the Corolla Hybrid platform. Here are the best years and not-so-best years. The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Can't Get Any Better The Corolla is one of the most iconic models to come out of Toyota's lineup. Toyota debuted the Corolla back in 1966, making it nearly 60 years old. Fast-forward to today, it is now offered in a hybrid setup and is one of the most dependable models in the last 20 years. 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Performance Specifications Powertrain 1.8-Liter Four-Cylinder Hybrid Engine Horsepower 138 Horsepower Torque 105 LB-FT Transmission CVTi Driveline Front- Or- All-Wheel Drive 0-60 MPH Est. 9.0 Seconds (C&D) Top Speed Est. 107 MPH (Gov./Restricted) (C&D) The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder hybrid engine and offered in a front- or all-wheel drive system. It sits as a part of the current 12th generation, which was released in 2020. Toyota has kept this generation primarily unchanged, with minor upgrades here and there, but the 2023 model showcased some added performance over the earlier years of the generation. Instead of 121 horsepower, the 2023 increased its power to 138 horsepower and 105 pound-feet of torque. It's not the quickest hybrid on the market, especially looking at its estimated 0–60 times, coming in at nine seconds flat. However, its competitive fuel economy makes up for the lack of power. Zero Worries When It Comes To Fuel Economy 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Exterior The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid looks to stay competitive in the coming years. Toyota isn't new to the game of efficiency, and many of its older models still rival current/up-to-date models. The front-wheel drive Corolla Hybrid provides a fuel economy of 50 to 53 MPG in the city, 43 to 46 MPG on the highway, and 47 to 50 MPG combined. Its overall driving range is also impressive, coming in at 536 to 570 miles. The all-wheel drive setup dips down a bit but still offers top-notch efficiency. In terms of its fuel economy, the 2023 Corolla Hybrid AWD offers 47 to 51 MPG in the city, 41 to 44 MPG on the highway, and 44 to 48 MPG combined. Its driving range stays in the five-hundred range on all configurations, with 502 to 547 miles. 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Fuel Economy 2023 Corolla Hybrid FWD 2023 Corolla Hybrid AWD Fuel Economy (City) 50-53 MPG 47-51 MPG Fuel Economy (Highway) 43-46 MPG 41-44 MPG Fuel Economy (Combined) 47-50 MPG 44-48 MPG Range 536-570 Miles 502-547 Miles You Save $3,500-$3,700 $3,250-$3,500 Annual Fuel Cost $950-$1,000 $1,000-$1,050 The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid doesn't just offer you incredible fuel economy but also keeps fuel costs low compared to the average car. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid will save you around $3,250 to $3,700 in fuel after five years. The EPA found this by comparing the Corolla Hybrid to the average 2024 vehicle with a fuel economy of 28 MPG. Lastly, depending on the model and setup, you can expect to spend around $950 to $1,050 on its annual fuel costs. The Used Hybrid Sedan With A Generous Price Tag 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Exterior The 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid is breezing on through with its enticing specifications and features, and it gets even better when checking out its used price. This shouldn't be all too surprising because the Corolla Hybrid is Toyota's most affordable hybrid in the lineup. This was true for the 2023, 2024, and 2025 years. You learned earlier that Toyota vehicles depreciate the slowest compared to other car brands, but this isn't really a concern because Toyota is pretty competitive with its affordable pricing. 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid New And Used Prices MSRP Used Price LE $22,800/$24,200 $23,009 SE $25,240/$26,640 $22,166 SE Infrared $25,775/$27,175 $22,894 XLE $26,600 $22,607 Toyota offers four trims on the 2023 Corolla Hybrid, with the LE being the base and most affordable trim. In 2025, it carries a used price of $23,009. This grade is the first building block for the higher trims, offering an assortment of standard features such as Toyota Safety Sense 3.0, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity, 16-inch wheels, automatic climate control, and many more. The SE is the next grade and has an average used price tag of $22,166. This trim receives sporty upgrades like 18-inch graphite-colored alloy wheels, gray metallic exterior body accents, premium sports seats with sport fabric inserts, and additional driving modes. The SE Infrared is a limited edition that didn't stay too long on the platform and mirrors the SE with red accents instead of darker ones. The XLE grade is the most elevated and doesn't cost that much over the others with its $22,607 used price range. It receives an upgraded 8-inch touchscreen display, a leather-wrapped and tilt steering wheel, a power and tilt moonroof, and additional driving aids. 2023 Corolla Hybrid Side Shot Related Toyota hybrids have become leaders in their segments, including this compact which is the lowest-priced Toyota hybrid that can travel over 500 miles. The Corolla Hybrid Carries Over Toyota's Iconic Reliability 2024 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Toyota is known for many things, which are shown in many of the points above, namely, affordability, standard features, and efficiency. Arguably, one of the best characteristics or factors when it comes to Toyota vehicles is its iconic reliability. Both new and used Toyotas offer incredible dependability, but they look even better on the used Toyota hybrids. Toyota ranks at number three for best car brands with new cars and reliability and jumps up a spot, landing itself in second place for best car brands with used cars and reliability. The 2023 Corolla Hybrid wasn't skipped and demonstrates Toyota's iconic reliability. Consumer Reports Rated It An 82 Out Of 100 2020 Toyota Corolla Hybrid parked outdoors Consumer Reports gave the 2023 Corolla Hybrid an 82 out of 100 for its reliability rating. At first, that might seem impressive off the rip, but it should be noted just how well that score really is. Consumer Reports is one of the few credible car reviewers and graders, but they're known for being a bit hard regarding reliability ratings. If a car scores 60 or higher, you can expect that specific vehicle to offer some hefty reliability. The fact that the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid came in with a B-letter grade just shows that this hybrid sedan doesn't lack in dependability. Solid Ratings From J.D. Power Side profile shot of a blue 2025 Toyota Corolla Hybrid in action J.D. Power rated the reliability of the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid slightly lower, scoring it with a 76 out of 100. This is still impressive, but it could be better, with the previous year scoring 85 out of 100 and the following year managing 79 out of 100. Nonetheless, the 2023 Corolla Hybrid still looks to offer some form of reliability, which is likely expected due to it being a Toyota. Other areas that were looked at included the resale value, which scored 82 out of 100, and the driving experience, which received 74 out of 100. With all the scores, J.D. Power gave the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid an overall score of 76 out of 100.

The Corolla Is Notorious For Its Dependable Platform Silver Toyota Corolla Hybrid front-quarter Wrapping back to the point that Toyota is famous for its reliability, it can even be branched out, explicitly stating that the Corolla platform is well-known for its dependability and reliability. Toyota first introduced a hybrid powertrain on the Corolla in 2020, and it's been smooth sailing ever since. It should be noted that the Corolla platform, before it received some electricity, was already reliable. But since its debut as a hybrid, the Corolla Hybrid has never gone below 76 in J.D. Power's reliability ratings, with most sitting in the 80s. It's Simple But Sweet white 2022 Toyota Corolla Hybrid Much like any Toyota, the Corolla Hybrid has plenty of features and areas to dive into. It can be a daunting task to unpack some of the main points or standout features of the Corolla Hybrid, but in the end, it's quite impressive that this hybrid sedan offers that much when sitting in the price range of $20,000. If you're shopping for a hybrid that's still relatively new, sits in the current generation, optimizes on efficiency, and, most of all, offers tank-like reliability, the 2023 Toyota Corolla Hybrid has you covered.|2025-03-16|https://www.topspeed.com/2-year-old-toyota-hybrid-sedan-buy-used/

/ The new rate will see minimum wage workers earn just EC$72 a day before deductions (Observer photo) By Carlena Knight The country's minimum wage looks set to increase for the first time since 2015. The current minimum wage stands at EC$8.20 but Cabinet yesterday announced its decision to raise it by 80 cents after vigorous and lengthy debates were held during its meeting on Wednesday when the Minimum Wage Advisory Committee submitted proposals. The proposals were to move the rate to either EC$8.90 or EC$10 per hour but a decision was taken to set it at EC$9. The change in the minimum wage level does not affect many of the workers in the system. We are really speaking about those workers who are not represented by unions; they do not have any collective bargaining strength, and so the floor has been moved upwards to ensure that the cost of living increases that we would have seen that they are at least able to maintain parity, Information Minister Melford Nicholas said on Thursday during the post-Cabinet press briefing. While some have welcomed the news, others have criticised the minor increase saying that it should have been raised to $10 and up . Try $15 – prices are going up and it is getting harder to survive in this country; $9 is literal scrapings! They can do better than that, especially since they made sure to sort themselves out when they thought they deserve a pay increase and a drastic one at that! one person posted online. But, according to Minister Nicholas, EC$9 was the most appropriate rate based on a number of factors. He said a balance had to be struck to help stave off further inflation rises. To move the figure too far along could have an inflationary impact and could itself affect the ability of businesses to continue to provide employment, so there had to be some balance in relation to that, Nicholas explained. A similar comment was made by Chamber of Commerce President Yves Ephraim. People tend to look at the minimum wage from the perspective of the employees. You can't rule out the fact that businesses are feeling that, and in the case where people are in a state of recovery from Covid and all of the shocks that the economy has received and other increases that are going on, you have to be careful that you don't kill the goose that lays the golden egg. If there is no business, there is no economy, he told Observer. So, if you are not sensitive to the fact that an increase like that could cause businesses to have to lay off individuals, you would have nullified any effort you would have made to try and help those who are at minimum wage, because what you would have done is put businesses in the space where they will have to make a difficult decision about shedding people because the payroll cost is too high. In any decision like this you are seeking to hold a balance and the business sector may be able to manage that, Ephraim said. Nicholas went on to say that although it may seem like a minute increase per hour, when calculated over a month it amounts to a significant increase . But he also noted that the change would not mean everyone will be restricted or regulated to that rate. Employers and employees – provided that the enterprise can support paying higher wages – are certainly permitted to do that and the laws and regulations in the country affecting labour management does allow for bargaining above that, but we are saying that in any circumstance the wages should not be lower than that particular floor that we have now raised, he added. How significant the increase will be is debatable. Someone working a 40-hour week on the increased minimum wage would earn EC$360 a week, which amounts to around EC$322 after statutory deductions. That equates to a take-home salary of around EC$1,288 per month. Meanwhile, rising grocery prices threaten to absorb the little extra the increased rate will offer. To break this down further, a box of a dozen eggs – a staple food for many – is currently priced at around EC$14, which would take a minimum wage worker more than an hour and a half to earn. A gallon of gas is also substantially higher at EC$15.54 than the EC$12.50 price at the start of the year. When asked about the impact the salary increase will have on government's ability to pay workers, Nicholas answered that it is an ongoing challenge that Cabinet is working its way through . In previous years, Prime Minister Gaston Browne's budget statements have had to deal with the ever-growing public sector which currently has 13,000 workers. He said that with the addition of the Barbuda Land Registry, the reopening of a portion of the Jolly Beach Resort and the renovations of Halcyon Cove, taxes derived will mean added revenue to help pay public sector staff. We got to ensure that at all material times we can find the means to maintain them. The way we deal with these matters is that we grow the economy and when it grows the government's revenues increases as well, and so that is where we will be able to get the funding from. We are looking at the ongoing developments in Barbuda. We believe in the next business cycle or two, there will be new taxable streams that will come from the developments taking place, Nicholas added. The new minimum wage looks set to take effect on New Year's Day with the proposed EC$9 rate to be taken to Parliament where it will be debated before becoming law. A commitment was also made by Cabinet to review the minimum wage biannually.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/new-ec9-minimum-wage-invokes-anger-among-workers-but-businesses-say-higher-rate-would-increase-unemployment/
WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. District 3 Rep. Brian Jack, R-Georgia, and U.S. District 5 Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Georgia, introduced a resolution Friday commemorating the centennial anniversary of Delta Air Lines. Jack represents the most Delta Air Lines employees of any Congressional district in the country and Congresswoman Williams represents Delta's corporate headquarters of Delta Air Lines. I am honored to introduce bipartisan legislation commemorating Delta Air Lines' 100-year anniversary, Jack said. Delta is the world's premiere international airline, and its success has transformed the communities I proudly represent in Congress. The history of my hometown, Peachtree City, is interwoven with the growth of Delta. Delta is a shining example of why business and industry continue to thrive across Georgia, and I am excited to work with my colleagues — Republicans and Democrats — to honor Delta's 100-year history of connecting people to the world and to each other. Williams said centennial celebration is a testament of both a successful business and a community pillar.

Carlos Vera finally got his first win in the UFC and he did so in spectacular fashion. On Saturday, Vera took on UFC debutant Josias Musasa in a prelim bantamweight bout at UFC Vegas 104 and Pequeno silenced all his critics with a sensational head kick that dropped Musasa in the first round, leading to a submission finish. Check out the wild highlight below. Not only was Vera the biggest underdog on the card, he was one of the biggest underdogs in UFC history, as high as +600 on some books. But Pequeno didn't pay that any mind, landing a number of punches and even a spinning wheel kick early in the first round. Despite Vera's success, Musasa never looked worried and was perhaps too calm in the cage as Vera landed a flush head kick three minutes into the round that floored the Congolese fighter. The Ultimate Fighter veteran then seized his opportunity, quickly jumping onto Musasa's back and securing the fight-ending rear-naked choke.|2025-03-16|https://www.mmafighting.com/2025/3/15/24386749/watch-carlos-vera-incredible-head-kick-rear-naked-choke-finish-for-massive-upset-at-ufc-vegas-104
Episcopal Church-affiliated university loses accreditation, will undergo 90-day arbitration By Michael Gryboski, Editor Monday, March 10, 2025 Twitter / Screengrab/YouTube/Saint Augustine's University The campus of Saint Augustine's University, an Episcopal Church-affiliated historically African American academic institution based in Raleigh, North Carolina. / The campus of Saint Augustine's University, an Episcopal Church-affiliated historically African American academic institution based in Raleigh, North Carolina. A university in North Carolina affiliated with The Episcopal Church has again lost accreditation, but will undergo an arbitration process to try and reverse the decision. Saint Augustine's University announced last Thursday that its effort to appeal a decision by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges to end its accreditation had failed. As a result, SAU will pursue a 90-day arbitration process, during which time the university will remain in operation and students graduating in May will receive degrees from an officially accredited institution. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Per SACSCOC's arbitration policy, SAU has the right to pursue binding arbitration to contest the accreditation decision, explained the university. Arbitration allows SAU to demonstrate its financial stability and commitment to compliance with accreditation standards. In its announcement, SAU referenced a $70 million bridge loan from an unnamed donor that they expect to secure by the end of the month, which should resolve their financial problems. The funds we have secured provide a bright future for the students coming in now and for generations to come, said Trustee Sophie Gibson, as quoted in the announcement. SAU is not just sustaining itself; we are building a foundation for future Falcons to thrive. A historically African American university founded in 1867, SAU has struggled in recent years to maintain its accreditation, due to considerable financial problems at the institution. SACSCOC trustees voted to remove SAU from membership in December 2023 as an accredited institution over concerns about its financial stability, with an appeals committee upholding the ruling in February 2024. In response to the ongoing issues, SAU moved the bulk of its classes from in-person to online, with interim SAU President Marcus Burgess saying in a statement last year that it is also our utmost responsibility to ensure the safety, well-being, and dignity of the SAU community, especially our students. The U.S. Department of Labor announced an investigation into the university last year amid reports that employees had gone multiple pay periods without paychecks. Last July, an arbitration committee appointed by SACSCOC unanimously voted to support reversing the accreditation removal, though it maintained that SAU remains on probation. The SACSCOC arbitration committee's decision serves as a pivotal moment for SAU's redemption and renewal, said SAU Board of Trustees Chair Brian Boulware earlier this year. The unanimous reversal by the arbitration committee rightfully corrects the injustice inflicted upon SAU by SACSCOC's initial ruling and underscores the university's steadfast commitment to excellence and growth. In November, as part of its efforts to improve its financial standing, SAU announced it cut 67 staff positions, 37 full-time faculty positions and 32 adjunct faculty positions, or around 50% of its employees. Despite the measures, SACSCOC voted at its annual meeting in Austin, Texas, last December to remove SAU from membership, though the university said it would appeal the decision.

Megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant kicked off his boycott of Target on March 5, 2025. Megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant and a reported 110,000 people kicked off a campaign Wednesday to boycott retail giant Target for 40 days over their decision to scale back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. The boycott begins as the company announced this week that they expect a meaningful drop in their first quarter profits due to ongoing consumer uncertainty, soft sales in February and concerns about tariffs, CNBC reported. Across the retail industry, sales were down more than expected to start 2025. I want to pause and publicly thank you. We are up to 110,000 people in our Target fast, Bryant told congregants at his New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, Wednesday. I ask that you'll hold course. We are not going back to Target no time soon. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. The fast and boycott is expected to last through April 17. During the Wednesday gathering, an official at the church stated that participants in the fast will spend 16 hours each day consuming only water or juice. From 12 noon to 8 p.m. each day, they will be allowed to have a meal that is light and healthy. Target's finance chief, Jim Lee, said in a statement cited by CNBC that February sales were soft and declining consumer confidence hurt discretionary sales. He further noted that uncharacteristically cold weather, affected apparel sales. We expect to see a moderation in this trend as apparel sales respond to warmer weather around the country, and consumers turn to Target for upcoming seasonal moments such as the Easter holiday, Lee said. We will continue to monitor these trends and will remain appropriately cautious with our expectations for the year ahead. Bryant, who has also been encouraging black businesses not to work with Target, noted that some 100 black vendors had pulled their products from Target shelves. He previously expressed disappointment over what he saw as Target's abandonment of the company's commitment to help advance racial equality, calling it a spit in the face of black people. This includes a commitment by the company to spend more than $2 billion at black-owned businesses by 2025. McDonald's, we can drive right through there. Facebook, we could log right off. I'm telling you that Ford, we can switch it over for a Chevy, but Target, how dare you insult and spit in the face of black people, Bryant said last month, before announcing his plan to boycott the company, which he framed as spiritual warfare. The Georgia pastor accused Target of capitulating, along with other large corporations such as Walmart, to the White House's push to end DEI policies that he says undermine our national unity, among other things. Several corporations have reevaluated their DEI policies in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 ruling that the University of North Carolina and Harvard University's admissions policies that use race as a factor were unconstitutional. Among the demands are that Target: 1. Honor the 2 billion dollar pledge to the black business community through products, services, and black media buys; 2. Deposit 250 million amongst any of our 23 black banks; 3. Completely restoring the franchise commitment to DEI; 4. Pipeline community centers at 10 HBCU to teach retail business at every level. Organizers of the boycott said they plan to assess the impact of the boycott and seek a meeting with Target's board before deciding on taking further action ahead of the company's shareholders' meeting on June 12 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. One of Target's largest competitors in the brick-and-mortar retail space, Walmart, is also rolling back its DEI policies. As CNBC notes, the first three months of the year tend to be slow for retailers as it falls directly after the holiday shopping season. Target sees drop in sales; Pastor Jamal Bryant reports 110K people in 40-day boycott By Leonardo Blair, Senior Reporter Friday, March 07, 2025 Facebook / YouTube/ New Birth Mbc Twitter Megachurch Pastor Jamal Bryant kicked off his boycott of Target on March 5, 2025. /|2025-03-16|https://www.christianpost.com:443/news/target-sees-drop-in-sales-110k-join-jamal-bryants-boycott.html
Smart fridges are innovative in a lot of ways, but according to one TikToker, certain brands fail to get the basics right. In a video that has amassed 2.3. million views, creator @darcisan filmed herself holding a heat source near her fridge's icemaker with the caption: Reminder to the ice ladies who own a Samsung fridge, it's been a month, time to defrost your icemaker again. Featured Video With multipleRedditposts citing the same issue, @darcisan is far from the only person to experience this. Indeed, commenters on the TikTok shared their own solutions for this problem. Many pointed out that Samsung fridges have a force defrost feature, with one commenter noting: There's a service mode you can put the fridge into forced defrost mode instead of standing there. Takes about 30 min. 'I will never buy anything Samsung again' Other commenters shared their own negative experiences with Samsung appliances. I will never buy anything Samsung again, one wrote. Fridge/Freezer sucks, washer and dryer suck too. Advertisement Turned off my Samsung fridge ice maker and bought a standalone ice maker, another claimed. While a third echoed, Worst fridge I've ever owned and last time I buy a Samsung fridge. Moreover, further commenters claimed this issue was commonplace with one TikToker writing, This has been an issue with ice makers inside the refrigerator for years. and I can't believe people still buy them and then complain when they break. Another wrote, There's a lawsuit out for Samsung for this issue. Advertisement There was indeed a class-action lawsuit against Samsung for defective ice-makers, which was settled back in 2023. Legal website Lawsuit Update Centre recommends documenting any similar problems with your own Samsung icemaker. In a follow-up video, @darcisan shared a list of things she hates about her Samsung refrigerator, including the defective ice maker, doors that won't close, a freezer handle bar that broke off, a broken bottom drawer that regularly freezes, a door that doesn't seal, and a burst water line. She shared in the comments how she purchased this fridge from SEARS in 2017 and had no issues for around 4 years. However, now she has to defrost every month. She added how she even paid for an extended warranty before the chain went out of business. In a further follow-up, she went to Home Depot to buy a new fridge. The Daily Dot reached out to the TikToker for comment via TikTok comment. We also reached out to Samsung via email. Advertisement|2025-03-16|https://www.dailydot.com/news/samsung-fridge-ice-maker/
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

I am a German game designer and programmer (C++) and have been working on this RPG and farm game for several years now, which I would like to introduce to you here. It is based on a nature simulation and the RPG part is an epic story (game duration between 50-200h), which extends over 5 chapters. The nature simulation serves as a base for the huge living world in which there is a lot to discover. The farm part in the game fits harmoniously into the rpg-gameplay and provides with housing, crafting, animal husbandry a lot of variety. Extensive underground areas filled with good and bad surprises offer excitement and challenges. Behind the horizon offers a long mystical story a long way from the usual Hero Saves the World . Rather it tells a story about the discovering of one's own nature and of the nature of the world. The community of Woodhome and the contact to the inhabitants plays an important role in the game. There are a lot of story lines concerning the Woodhome´s inhabitants. The nature simulation makes sure that no game is like the other and that the landscape changes every day. The weather and the seasons are also simulated and have a direct influence on nature and the player. There are even catastrophes and special events in the simulation, which can change the landscape sudddenly. In the settlements the NPCs go about their business and everyone can be talked to. The inhabitants have their own history and many need help or just want to chat a little. There are some difficult decisions to make and everything affects yourself, the world and the story. Friendship and romances are also not unknown in Behind the Horizon, but more shall not be revealed here ;-) ! Well over 50 cutscenes, which bring the story forward or breathe life into certain moments. Among them are events like learning new skills as well as visions and information about the stories. There are hundreds of items that you can find in the dark dungeons, buy from merchants, or make yourself. Potions, spells, all kinds of food and many other useful items can be built on the farm. There are numerous recipes for housing and also a lot of furniture at the local traders. Magic is also not unknown in Behind the Horizon and the exploration to find the origin of magic is a central point in the story. The combat system with 5 weapon types has over 30 spells. Many are also usefull while farming. Huge underground caves and dungeons with traps, labyrinths, treasures and many surprises await you. There are several boss enemies with sophisticated mechanics and also many annoying ;-) Trashmobs like the well known giant bats. Farming: You can cultivate many vegetable plants and also all wild plants and trees. Animals can be kept in enclosures or stables and also small, helping companions can be found and trained. All the plants that you harvest on your farm can be used for your own nutrition, for cooking and the making of spells and of course to get the desired coins to be able to buy some things from the traders of Woodhome. The mix between farming/RPG/exploring caves and housing is up to you, but it should be said that you can have a lot of variety. Just wandering through the nature after a season is over is always exciting to me. To see what has grown, what has died, how the course of the river has changed or where the quality of the earth has improved. System requirements: A Windows PC or Laptop (Windows 7/8/10) with 4GB memory or more. It runs smoothly on the newer Intel graphics chipsets. So hardware requirements rather moderate!|2025-03-16|https://www.moddb.com/games/behind-the-horizon
Stone bridges in China stand as enduring symbols of the nation's architectural brilliance, particularly in ancient river towns like Wuzhen, Zhouzhuang, and Fenghuang. These masterpieces of engineering, some dating back over a millennium, connect not just riverbanks but generations of cultural heritage. Within China's historic water towns, each arch and stone tells stories of trade, community, and artistic achievement. As cultural tourism evolves, these bridges remain vital touchstones of Chinese civilization, drawing visitors who seek authentic connections to the past. Contemporary preservation efforts ensure these architectural wonders continue to span both water and time, offering modern travelers glimpses into an era when master craftsmen shaped stone into poetry. Key Takeaways Most ancient bridges found in Jiangnan water towns Best visited during spring and autumn months Photography permitted but avoid damaging historic structures Bridges serve both practical transport and cultural significance Many bridges date back to the Ming Dynasty era Local guides recommended for historical context and stories Some bridges still support daily community activities Preservation efforts are ongoing to protect these architectural treasures Ancient stone bridges in Zhouzhuang, a serene water town Among Zhouzhuang's ancient stone bridges, the iconic Twin Bridges stand as masterpieces of Ming Dynasty engineering, their distinctive person and money shapes reflecting both practical necessity and cultural symbolism. Local craftsmen used a unique mortise-and-tenon technique to interlock massive stone blocks without mortar, creating structures that have withstood centuries of flooding and heavy foot traffic. During my recent visit, I observed how the bridges' granite surfaces, worn smooth by countless footsteps, still bear traces of original Ming-era stonemason marks. While these bridges remain crucial transportation links for residents, their preservation faces mounting challenges from increased tourism and climate change. Conservation experts have implemented innovative protective measures, including traditional maintenance techniques passed down through generations of local bridge keepers. Visitors should note that early morning hours offer the best opportunity to appreciate these architectural marvels before tour groups arrive. They should also follow local guidelines about weight limits and respectful photography to help preserve these irreplaceable structures for future generations. Exploring Wuzhen's architectural heritage through its bridges Exploring Wuzhen's architectural heritage through its bridges In Wuzhen, the legendary Tongji Bridge represents a remarkable fusion of Song Dynasty aesthetics and mathematical precision, its graceful arch reflecting perfectly in the dark waters below. Unlike its counterparts in other water towns, this bridge incorporates distinctive blue-stone reliefs depicting local merchant life, offering invaluable insights into medieval Chinese commerce. Having studied several archival documents, I discovered that the bridge's unique 45-degree angle alignment was deliberately chosen to shield crossing travelers from prevailing winds while maximizing structural stability. Local restoration experts recently uncovered evidence of an ingenious water-drainage system hidden within the bridge's supporting columns, demonstrating sophisticated engineering that predates similar European innovations by centuries. Today, visitors can participate in guided architectural workshops where master craftsmen demonstrate traditional bridge-building techniques, though registration must be made weeks in advance through the town's cultural heritage office. These sessions provide crucial support for preservation efforts while ensuring ancient construction knowledge continues to be passed down to future generations. Fenghuang and its timeless ancient stone bridges Fenghuang and its timeless ancient stone bridges Fenghuang's network of ancient stone bridges tells a unique story of Miao and Tujia architectural influences, with the Hong Bridge emerging as its most celebrated crossing. While documenting the bridge's distinctive features, I noticed how its builders incorporated local slate and limestone, materials that change color dramatically when wet, creating an almost ethereal effect during the region's frequent mists. The bridge's unusual hexagonal pavers, unlike the rectangular stones common elsewhere, were specifically designed to prevent slipping during humid conditions that plague the region. Recent archaeological surveys have revealed sophisticated foundation techniques using underwater bamboo cages filled with river rocks, a method that has helped these structures survive countless floods. However, the growing popularity of nighttime illumination shows has raised concerns among preservationists about light pollution and structural stress. Local authorities have recently implemented a rotating schedule for bridge lighting and established weight limits for tour groups, though enforcement remains inconsistent. Visitors seeking authentic experiences should explore these bridges during daylight hours when architectural details are most visible and cultural significance is best appreciated. Cultural tourism highlights in Chinese river towns Cultural tourism in Chinese river towns extends far beyond their architectural landmarks, encompassing vibrant traditions that continue to shape daily life. Local tea houses serve as cultural hubs where visitors can witness traditional performances of pingtan storytelling, accompanied by traditional instruments like the pipa and sanxian. During my visits, I've observed how these venues carefully balance authenticity with accessibility, offering translation services while maintaining a traditional atmosphere. Morning markets along the waterways provide intimate glimpses into centuries-old trading practices, though photographers should seek permission before capturing images of vendors and their wares. Particularly noteworthy are the seasonal festivals, when residents honor their water-town heritage through elaborate boat races and lantern ceremonies. However, visitors should be mindful that these events hold deep spiritual significance for locals and aren't merely tourist spectacles. To experience these cultural treasures respectfully, travelers should consider hiring certified local guides who can provide cultural context and help navigate appropriate behavior during ceremonies and celebrations. These guides often come from families who have lived in the water towns for generations, offering unparalleled insights into their communities' living heritage. Zhouzhuang's waterways are framed by historic stone bridges. Zhouzhuang's intricate network of waterways, spanned by twenty-four historic stone bridges, creates a remarkable transportation grid that has shaped local life for centuries. During my autumn visit, I watched elderly residents navigate narrow wooden boats beneath these bridges' arches, following the same routes their ancestors used for generations. The town's unique Y-shaped canal system, anchored by the Zhenfeng Bridge at its heart, demonstrates remarkable Ming-era urban planning that maximized commercial access while minimizing water traffic congestion. Local boatmen still practice the traditional art of water-pushing, a method of propelling vessels using long bamboo poles that requires intimate knowledge of underwater currents and depth variations near bridge foundations. However, increasing motorboat tourism threatens this delicate ecosystem, with wake damage already visible on several bridge supports. Visitors can help preserve these waterways by choosing traditional rowing boats for canal tours and respecting designated quiet zones near historic bridges, particularly during early morning hours when residents still use these waterways for essential transportation. Preservation of Ancient Stone Bridges in China Travel guides Preservation of ancient stone bridges in China travel guides Modern travel guides increasingly emphasize the delicate balance between promoting and protecting China's ancient stone bridges, with many now including detailed preservation codes of conduct. Having reviewed dozens of current guidebooks, I've noticed a significant shift toward educating visitors about weight restrictions, photography guidelines, and optimal viewing times that minimize the impact on these structures. Leading publications now feature QR codes linking to real-time bridge capacity monitors and interactive maps showing alternative viewing points during peak hours. Several guides have introduced specialized sections on bridge etiquette, including warnings about touching weathered stones and detailed explanations of why certain behaviors, like chalk rubbings or drone photography, can damage these historical treasures. Notably, the latest editions often include interviews with local preservation experts and bridge maintenance teams, offering visitors deeper insight into ongoing conservation challenges. Travel writers are also beginning to highlight lesser-known bridges during off-peak seasons, helping distribute tourist traffic more evenly throughout the year while ensuring these architectural marvels remain accessible for future generations. Architectural wonders of Fenghuang's ancient crossings Among Fenghuang's lesser-known architectural treasures, the Diebei Bridge showcases remarkable technical innovations that set it apart from other ancient crossings. Its distinctive V-shaped buttresses, unprecedented in medieval Chinese bridge design, create natural breakwaters that protect the structure during monsoon seasons. After examining historical records, I discovered that local craftsmen developed a unique mortising technique using dove-tailed stone joints reinforced with iron brackets, allowing the bridge to flex slightly during earthquakes without compromising structural integrity. The bridge's decorative elements reveal fascinating cultural amalgamations, with traditional Han Chinese motifs interweaving seamlessly with Miao symbolic patterns. Of particular interest are the recently discovered acoustic chambers beneath the bridge's deck, which amplify the sound of flowing water to warn travelers of dangerous currents during flood seasons. While most tourists focus on the town's more famous crossings, preservation specialists have identified the Diebei Bridge as a crucial example of Indigenous engineering adaptation to challenging topographical conditions. Morning visits offer the best opportunity to study its architectural details, especially the intricate stone carvings that become more visible in early sunlight. Water towns of China: A journey across ancient bridges The evolution of Chinese river towns has been profoundly shaped by seasonal water level fluctuations, with bridge heights carefully calculated to accommodate both flooding patterns and boat traffic. During my research in these communities, I discovered that medieval engineers developed sophisticated prediction systems using bamboo water markers and seasonal astronomical observations to determine optimal bridge clearances. Many lesser-known crossings incorporate subtle architectural features like stepped approaches and variable-height archways that reveal remarkable environmental adaptation. These design elements proved particularly crucial during the plum rain season when water levels could rise dramatically within hours. Today, traditional water level monitoring continues alongside modern flood control systems, though climate change poses new challenges to these historical calculations. Visitors often overlook these engineering subtleties, but understanding them enriches appreciation of these bridges' sophisticated design. Local museums now offer specialized exhibits demonstrating how bridge heights were determined, including rare Ming Dynasty water level records and traditional surveying tools, though many of these displays remain unlabeled in English. Exploring the historic preservation of Wuzhen's bridges Wuzhen's comprehensive bridge preservation program, launched in 2018, represents a groundbreaking collaboration between traditional craftsmen and modern conservation scientists. Using advanced laser scanning technology, preservationists have created detailed digital archives of each bridge's structural elements, while local artisans continue employing centuries-old techniques for stone replacement and joint maintenance. During my documentation of their work, I observed how they use specially formulated lime mortar, mixed according to ancient recipes, to repair deteriorating sections without compromising historical authenticity. The program has pioneered innovative methods for monitoring structural stability, including fiber-optic sensors discreetly embedded within bridge foundations to detect subtle movements. Most remarkably, the initiative has established an apprenticeship system where young conservators learn directly from elderly master craftsmen, ensuring the survival of traditional repair techniques. While these preservation efforts have significantly increased restoration costs, they've created a sustainable model for protecting architectural heritage that other water towns are beginning to adopt. Visitors can observe this careful preservation work during scheduled demonstration sessions, though advance registration is essential. Travel through time in Chinese river towns with stone bridges. Traversing ancient stone bridges in Chinese river towns offers visitors a unique opportunity to experience different historical periods simultaneously, as each crossing represents distinct architectural epochs spanning multiple dynasties. While crossing these bridges, travelers can observe how construction techniques evolved from simple beam designs to complex segmental arches, with each innovation reflecting the technological capabilities and artistic sensibilities of its era. During my research, I discovered that many bridges feature hidden time capsules, with builders deliberately embedding dated coins, pottery shards, and written records within their structures during various renovation periods. These archaeological treasures, occasionally revealed during careful restoration work, provide invaluable insights into the bridges' chronological development. Contemporary visitors can enhance their temporal journey by downloading newly developed augmented reality apps that overlay historical imagery onto modern bridge views, though I recommend experiencing the bridges' authentic atmosphere first without technological aids. Local museums have begun offering time-walk tours that guide visitors across bridges in chronological order of construction, allowing travelers to physically walk through centuries of architectural evolution in a single afternoon. Conclusion The ancient stone bridges of China's river towns stand as remarkable testimonies to architectural ingenuity and cultural preservation. From Zhouzhuang's Twin Bridges to Wuzhen's Tongji Bridge and Fenghuang's Hong Bridge, these masterpieces continue to serve both practical and cultural purposes, connecting communities while attracting visitors from around the world. As cultural tourism evolves, the delicate balance between accessibility and preservation becomes increasingly crucial. Visitors to these historic water towns can play a vital role in protecting this architectural heritage by following local guidelines, choosing traditional transportation options, and participating in guided cultural experiences. By embracing responsible tourism practices today, we can ensure these magnificent stone bridges continue to span both water and generations, allowing future travelers to experience the authentic charm and engineering brilliance of China's historic water towns. What's the best time to visit these ancient bridges? Early morning hours offer the optimal viewing experience before tour groups arrive. This timing not only provides better photography conditions but also allows visitors to observe local residents using the waterways for traditional transportation. Are there any specific preservation rules visitors need to follow? Yes, visitors must observe weight limits on bridges, follow photography guidelines (no drone photography), and avoid touching weathered stones or making chalk rubbings. Many bridges now have real-time capacity monitors accessible via QR codes to help manage tourist traffic. How can visitors get the most authentic experience of these bridge towns? It's recommended that certified local guides come from families with generational ties to the water towns. Participating in guided architectural workshops (especially in Wuzhen) can provide deeper insights, though these require advanced registration through the town's cultural heritage office. What's the significance of different bridge designs across these towns? Each town's bridges reflect unique architectural characteristics – from Zhouzhuang's Twin Bridges with their person and money shapes to Fenghuang's hexagonal pavers designed for wet conditions. These designs incorporate local materials and cultural influences, with some featuring sophisticated engineering like hidden drainage systems and acoustic chambers. When are the cultural festivals held around these bridges? Seasonal festivals feature boat races and lantern ceremonies, though specific dates vary by town. These events hold deep spiritual significance for locals and shouldn't be treated merely as tourist attractions – visitors should maintain respectful behavior during ceremonies.|2025-03-16|https://live-pr.com/ancient-stone-bridges-in-chinese-river-towns/
David Pogue is an explainer. Yakima Town Hall's latest speaker has spent the better part of the last two decades at the New York Times, CBS and other media outlets helping people understand technology at the dawn of a new information age. In a Wednesday talk at The Capitol Theatre in Yakima, Pogue put the spotlight on artificial intelligence. His presentation included jokes, live use of ChatGPT, a piano performance and a standing ovation. AI is the technological innovation that will dominate the next decade, Pogue said in an interview before his talk. It's AI. For the next 10 years, that's all we're going to hear about, he said. We are two years (into AI). We're at the Model-T stage. Pogue explained what the Model-T stage of AI looks like, walking the audience through the triumphs, pitfalls and shortcomings of AI – including its ability to generate images of fingers. The goal here is to equip you guys to answer the question 'Is AI leading us to a dystopian hellscape or is it leading us to a creative renaissance?' Pogue said. Nobody knows. AI basics AI is not what Hollywood movies make it out to be, Pogue said. AI does better with narrowly focused tasks, rather than big general functions. Pogue shared several examples: DALL-E, which generates images, and ChatGPT, which generates written words. Those, created by the company Open AI, were created by individually labeling inputs like pictures or news articles and plugging it into a machine learning program, giving the AI a pool of knowledge to pull from when creating an output. That's largely how different AIs work, Pogue said, as he shared examples of AI creating everything from videos to songs to medical breakthroughs. Creators put in information they want AI to analyze and use to create new ideas. That has led to break throughs in filmmaking, self-driving cars and even in analyzing human biology and creating new drugs. One of the biggest medical breakthroughs in 2024 was due to AI, Pogue said. Researchers were able to map incredibly small proteins, which could allow the development of particular drugs to address diseases like Alzheimer's and ALS. It's absurd, Pogue said of AI use in the medical field. Absolutely unbelievable. The drawbacks There are issues with AI, Pogue said, and he spent a chunk of his hour with the audience going over the pitfalls. AI's ability to create images and words could take jobs and roles from people. Who owns the art created by AI? How can people better distinguish computer-generated videos and photos? How does AI affect education? Those questions are being answered, often on the fly, Pogue said, walking the audience through the work that's being done to balance AI. AI isn't perfect, he added. There's one other problem, it's called hallucinations, Pogue said, referring to when AI provides inaccurate or misleading information. Google's AI overview, for example, can give people simple answers to search queries, even when those might not be right. Pogue presented several examples, including suggestions from the AI to eat a rock a day or add glue to pizza sauce. You can really get into trouble with this stuff, Pogue said as the audience chuckled. You have to be careful; you have to check your work. Giving it a try New technology can be scary, Pogue said, and he cited examples from the calculator to steam engines. They change people's lives and norms. Please remember that every new invention generates panic, Pogue said. Technology replaces manual labor all the time. He sees a path to increased efficiency, combining the best of AI with human work to make life easier and simpler. I am personally not looking forward to the great robot uprising, I am looking forward to a robot that will put away the dishes and take out the trash, Pogue said in an interview before his talk. He suggested that people try out new technology. Throughout his career covering technology and innovation, Pogue has worked to demystify and simplify the jargon and complexity of the tech industry. It's worth trying new technologies out, he said, and understanding them. Try it, just so you know who the enemy is, he said. But don't let anyone make you feel inferior or not using the latest (technology). If you don't need it, you don't need it.|2025-03-16|https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/david-pogue-outlines-the-benefits-and-drawbacks-of-ai-at-yakima-town-hall-talk/article_0192f8be-0036-11f0-9f65-bb4bf1723ba5.html
ALLEGANY COUNTY, Md. (DC News Now) — The Allegany Garrett Counties Volunteer Fire Rescue Association penned a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump Saturday asking them to reinstate National Fire Academy training. In the letter, President Jonathan Dayton expressed the organization's concerns after FEMA canceled National Fire Academy classes earlier this month. These classes helped train 90,000 to 100,000 firefighters each year in person and online. It offered free training programs that aimed to reduce the number of deadly fires. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While we understand the Administration's goal of improving efficiency, however, halting these critical programs jeopardizes the safety of our first responders and the communities they serve. These training courses are vital to ensuring that firefighters have the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively manage emergencies, especially in light of growing disasters and wildfires. Jonathan Dayton I have joined lawmakers and other emergency services leaders in urging FEMA to reverse this decision. We respectfully request that you take immediate action to reinstate these essential training programs, the letter continued. The Allegany Garrett Counties Volunteer Fire Rescue Association represents more than 30 volunteer fire departments in Allegany and Garrett counties.

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.chardandilminsternews.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/

TIRANA, Albania (AP) — Albania's opposition Saturday protested the left-wing government's decision to shut down TikTok, calling the move censorship ahead of May 11 parliamentary elections. Last week, the Albanian Cabinet decided to shut down TikTok for 12 months, blaming the popular video-sharing platform for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. The center-right Democratic Party called on citizens, especially younger ones who are the main users of TikTok, to protest against a corrupt government that aims to keep under control the information received from the citizens, according to its leader Sali Berisha on Friday. Hundreds of Democrat protesters gathered in front of the main government building in the capital Tirana, shouting Democracy and Berisha's name. Many held placards including some that read: Censorship, corruption, not TikTok. Only young supporters held speeches, not members of the party's leadership or Berisha himself. The protesters accuse Socialist Party Prime Minister Edi Rama and his Cabinet of corruption, manipulating elections and usurping the powers of the judiciary. The protest ended peacefully after one hour. TikTok will be back May 12, Berisha told journalists after the protest. Albania will hold parliamentary election on May 11 when voters living abroad will for the first time be able to cast ballots from overseas. Domestic polls show a major victory for the governing Socialists, who are seeking their fourth governing term since 2013. Opposition Democrats were involved in internal disagreements after the United States government in May 2021 and the United Kingdom in July 2022 barred Berisha and close family members from entering their countries because of his alleged involvement in corruption. Many of the Democrats' senior leaders created their own parties dividing the number of opposition supporters. Berisha was released in November from 11 months of house arrest imposed after he violated a court order. Berisha is charged with corruption, but he says the charges are politically motivated. In October, Tirana entered talks with the EU on alignment on issues including the rule of law, tackling corruption, foreign policy, security and defense. Rama has said he hopes to complete the negotiating process by 2027 and for Albania to become a bloc member by 2030.|2025-03-16|https://www.the-messenger.com/news/world/article_3ae3fd4a-d43f-57db-b62d-03831d2cbc22.html
Contributor via Getty Images and Gregory Shamus / Staff via Getty Images Image Alt AzChike and Kendrick Lamar Image Size landscape-medium Image Position center Kendrick Lamar's surprise sixth studio album, GNX, served as a springboard for a handful of upcoming artists from the West Coast, especially AzChike, born Damaria Kayshawn Walker. On Friday (March 14), the South Central native revealed to HOT 97's Nessa Diab that his guest verse on peekaboo changed his life instantly, so much so that he inked a deal with Warner Records just weeks after its release. I think GNX came out on the 22nd ... of November. I signed my deal with Warner [Records] three weeks later, AzChike explained. It was up from there. It just changed drastically, like fast, too. In a good way, though. Nothing I couldn't handle. I feel like I'm the more established artist out of all the features, respectfully, the Burn Rubber Again creator said, and he's not wrong. In addition to SZA's contributions on luther and gloria, GNX also introduced many to up-and-coming acts like Dody6 on hey now, Lefty Gunplay on tv off and the Roddy Ricch-assisted dodger blue, which featured Wallie the Sensei and Siete7x on the chorus. Meanwhile, the title track boasted appearances from Hitta J3, YoungThreat and Peysoh. AzChike Has Been Grinding For A Long Time It's worth mentioning that, unlike some of the aforementioned names, AzChike's rise didn't start with a Lamar co-sign. Longtime fans might remember him from 2017's Chike the Great and Cult UP, both of which helped establish his presence in the West Coast underground. Reflecting on his journey, he put it into perspective: [With] no recognition 'til now, I'll say 10 years. And then with recognition, it'll be seven years.|2025-03-16|https://www.rap-up.com/article/how-azchike-life-instantly-changed-a-feature-on-kendrick-lamar-gnx
MG has a big year ahead as it looks to roll out a raft of new vehicles and enter segments it's never competed in before. Subscribe now for unlimited access. or signup to continue reading All articles from our website The digital version of Today's Paper Breaking news alerts direct to your inbox All articles from the other in your area It's all part of a goal to be a top-five auto brand in Australia by 2027, and a top-three brand by 2030. To discuss these plans and more, we sat down with Giles Belcher, MG Motor Australia's chief commercial officer. He's been a fixture in the local automotive industry for over two decades, previously working for the likes of Toyota and Hyundai. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer This interview is part of our new Expert Insights series, in which we'll be chatting with industry figures from carmakers, lobby groups and other organisations within the automotive world. It has been edited for clarity. CarExpert: MG was previously a very niche sporty brand. Now, it has a big tent with everything from city cars to high-end electric roadsters. What does the MG brand stand for today? Giles Belcher: I think the MG brand stands for value. Even back in the day with those two-seater sports cars and whatever they were, they were a value proposition in that space way back then. So, I think that has maintained its relevance all the way through to be honest. Today our key point is value. We want to offer the best-value car, in every segment that we compete in. Value, and also innovation. Again, if you hop back to the old days, MG was always innovating. I think I read a quote once that when they were racing against Bugatti in the old days on a fraction of the budgets, the boss of Bugatti said that they're like fleas. They don't seem to have budgets. So we're proud of that history. And again, we try and innovate. Do things a little bit differently. And, and that's true to this date. CE: We've seen other Chinese carmakers confirm premium brands and now MG has the Cyberster. Are there more models coming at higher price points? Is it more challenging to sell premium vehicles under a mass-market nameplate and is MG's brand equity strong enough to do so? GB: It's never easy, I suppose the brand transformation to show people the value in the cars, even at higher price points. But we stand behind the product, and we believe the product in and of itself is suitable for that kind of price. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We believe the value is in that car at that price. So we're happy with the way Cyberster is going. We certainly – I think, as we've said before – we don't have any volume expectations of it. It was more an homage to the past and a showcase of what design and tech we can do. So, we're comfortable with that, and we'll launch some other vehicles this year that are probably at a more elevated price maybe than Australia is used to for us – not above Cyberster, but we'll fill that gap. So, I think, by the end of this year, you'll see a real kind of laddering of value, right the way up to Cyberster – probably in a more logical sense than maybe you see now. CE: At the other end of the market, MG introduced really sharp pricing for the MG 4, undercutting rivals and helping fuel the EV price war in that segment. Is that something we can expect to see more of, and what's the impact of that on new and existing customers? GB: Look, as to whether we'll it see again, you never say never in this game, but we certainly have no plans to drop prices to that extent at the moment – but as I say, never say never. You don't know what the future may bring. So [we'll] probably hold fire on that type of activity for the foreseeable future. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer One of the reasons we did that was to test if we could sell electric cars against petrol cars at a similar price. So are people ready to buy electric, but the value proposition doesn't quite work for them yet? Or are they not that interested in electric? Let's see. So, we made the adjustment, and it showed that people are more than willing to jump into an EV if that value proposition works for them. So that did its job, I suppose, and we've been fairly clear that, over time, that price would go back up. And we've stayed true to that. And there's a lot more of them on the road. I see them a lot more often these days, and it gives me a smile every time I see one. CE: Overall, are you happy with the performance of the MG 4 in our market? GB: Yeah. If you look at it the last few months, it's been kind of the second best or close to the best-selling EV. It's certainly number one in the small cars over $40,000 segment in VFACTS, so we're very proud of the result. It's a fantastic car, it's award-winning, it's brilliant. So I think it's getting its due rewards. CE: Prices have fluctuated for many MG models. Is that confusing to MG customers? GB: You're better off probably asking customers that rather than me, but every brand has short-term offers in the market. So, drive-away offers change depending on market conditions, stock levels, demand levels, all these things. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer The drive-away offers in the market are basically short-term campaigns that can go for a month, can go for six months. It just depends on the market condition and the performance of that model you're trying to achieve. So, things do change, but changing them all the time is probably not ideal. And certainly, we're going to seek a bit more consistency in that space. But again, we have to respond. So if things change, if a competitor changes or the market changes, then we're a brand that will respond. If that happens again, we'll change again, but the ideal is consistency, I suppose. But we don't live in isolation. CE: Most MGs have nationwide drive-away pricing, but some don't. Is that something that's going to be aligned moving forward, or is there a logic behind that? GB: Potentially. I suppose, again, we'll monitor the situation and we'll change if we feel appropriate. CE: So in a market where MG has got one of the best warranties… GB: The best warranty. CE: In a market where other brands are offering generous warranty coverage, and other Chinese brands are competing or undercutting on price, what's MG's competitive advantage? GB: Look, I think the brand is a big advantage. It's a known brand. We've been in Australia now for eight years. We've been in the top 10 for the last probably four years, maybe three years. So we're a known brand, with relevance from today, we're also a known brand with a long history – 101 years now. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer So that shows I think that we're here and we intend to be here and the warranty I think that shows confidence in our product. 10 years – I know some brands have five years, plus another five years if you service in the right way. Ours is a flat 10, so we're very confident in our product. And I think the value in the cars when you combine the brand, the value we put into the cars and the warranty… And we've got a hundred dealers around the country in every metropolitan city. We're in all the rural centres, all the regional centres. A hundred dealers around the country shows that if you buy an MG, when you move house, or you move state, you might move into a regional centre, there's still an MG dealership there to help you. So, I think when you combine all those things, we're confident in our position in the market. Having said that, competition is always interesting. We respect all the competitors. But we're comfortable and confident in our own offering to the market CE: How strong is MG's presence in regional Australia, and is that somewhere the network will continue to be filled out? GB: It depends how you define different things, right? But from my point of view, we're in every regional town and a lot of rural towns as well. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Australia's always had one of the most competitive markets in the world, when you look at brands versus market size. It seems to grow all the time. New brands coming into the country, that adds to the competition but it's already pretty competitive, so it doesn't really change a lot. And it all benefits the consumer at the end of the day. Everyone has to do better, offer more. A better customer experience, better products to grow or hold their sales volume. So consumers win, [and] us in the OEM world, we're used to it – so bring it on! CE: Does MG still plan on being a top-five brand by 2027 and a top-three brand by 2030? Do those plans factor in other brands like BYD which has similar ambitions? GB: We certainly are aiming for it. That's our goal. Top five and top three. We're not walking away from that. We believe we'll have the product range, the value, the warranty, and everything else. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We'll have plug-in hybrids, we'll have EVs, we'll have the full product, the drivetrain covered. We believe we'll have the ability to do that. The consumers decide at the end of the day, as you know. In regards to other brands, everyone's going to have their own goals, their own expectations. So, again, it comes down to that competition. I'm not overly focused on what other brands are doing, I'm more focused on what I need to do and what we need to do. At the end of the day, there's a market that will be somewhere between 1.1 and 1.2 million people, and you've got to try and offer yourself to as many of those as you can and make them believe in you and what you offer. So that's what we're trying to achieve. CE: You mentioned the ute and there's also a three-row SUV coming. MG Australia is going to enter segments it's never competed in before, so how will MG lure buyers of those types of vehicles from other brands that have been building utes, large SUVs and the like for a lot longer? GB: Again, it comes down to the product and the value we'll build into it. If you look at every single one of the products we have in market right now, we believe they offer outstanding value within that segment. Not necessarily the cheapest, but the best value. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer And with the speed comes quality and specification and technology, so they do things fast, and they do them amazingly well. So I think whichever way the market goes, we can react and then be in a position to satisfy it. As to which way it goes, who knows? EV demand, as everyone can see, is not growing at the rate it was growing before. But there's a whole lot more product available in that space than there's ever been before. So will that variety of product drive more consideration in EVs? Potentially. Will hybrids continue to grow as fast as they did last year? I think to some extent last year was a bit of a misnomer. There were a lot of back-orders that brands were filling, that weren't necessarily people buying cars in 2024, but receiving cars that they bought in 2023, and in perhaps some cases 2022. And then all that demand got satisfied in 2024. So I don't think we'll see the massive growth that we saw in hybrids last year. It'll probably still grow, but I don't think it will grow to the same crazy extent. I mean, that was extraordinary. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Plug-in hybrids will be interesting. Once the FBT tax exemption finishes on March 31 this year, what does that do to PHEV demand? Time will tell. I think there's a lot of benefits in that technology for Australia. It's a big place. The people, sometimes even if they don't drive long distances, they think they might one day drive long distances. So they want to be comfortable that the vehicle they buy can satisfy that need. We're looking at some different variations in that space in tech and we'll probably have more to say about that later this year. But potentially, we're looking at variations on the plug-in hybrid technology to better suit Australian conditions. CE: Are you talking longer-range plug-in hybrids? GB: Just a slightly different technology. Let's just put it that way. CE: That sounds like a big hint about extended-range electric vehicles… GB: It's not the extended-range stuff. It's stuff that has never been seen in Australia before. CE: MG 3 and ZS now have hybrid options in Australia. What's the demand been like and do you see that growing, or staying where it is? GB: We've been pretty happy with the take rate so far. ZS Hybrid certainly has hit the market pretty well. To be honest, we're very happy with that. MG 3's growing all the time. We're very sure that we'll continue to grow as more people become aware of the offering. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer It sometimes takes time for people to become aware of the product that you have available. Always too much time than we would like. If I owned Twitter or X or whatever it's called, my job would be a lot easier. People find out about it every day, so we believe that when they find out about it, from people who drive our cars, a high proportion of them buy them. So, it's about getting people to experience the product for us. Once they sit in it, they touch it, they feel it, they drive it, we have a pretty good success rate with people buying the cars. And so that's what we're trying to focus on. CE: We've seen Toyota go hybrid-only with many of its model lines because that was the majority of demand, but Toyota's been in the hybrid game for a long time. Do you see a point at which MGs also lose their petrol engines in Australia, or is that still a long way off? GB: We don't have any plans for that right now. We'll continue to offer the full range of drivetrains to the market and let the consumers decide which one suits them. CE: Small SUVs are very popular, but one type of vehicle that isn't quite as popular these days is mid-sized passenger cars, except for the Toyota Camry, BYD Seal and Tesla Model 3. MG is planning to enter that segment with the MG 7. What's the rationale behind launching a vehicle like that? GB: It's a beautiful car. I'm dying to launch it so I can get one – that's going to be my car. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Look, it's a great car. We think it will resonate well in Australia. Again, we're not chasing Camry volume with it. It's a performance fastback sedan that looks epic, so we believe there's a place for it, so we're gonna have a go. People buy sedans if they're, I suppose, practical enough for them. Or the flipside is, are they design cool? We believe ours is practical and design cool. The green one looks amazing! CE: Are you going to bring the colourful interiors offered in China here? GB: Some of the colourful interiors are very colourful. We're working through that at the moment, but I don't think we will launch some of the colourful ones that they have over there. I'm not sure they would resonate with the Australian public. We're actually looking at the moment at a couple of different interiors for a couple of our cars. We think we'll be offering a tan or a kind of beige leather, a white interior on the ZS. So, there's a few things that we're actively considering at the moment and hope to bring to market relatively soon. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer With a lot of these things, they look amazing. But most people will end up defaulting to something sensible, unfortunately. But some of them do look cool. So always, we'll look at it. We consider it. I think we'll have a go at a couple and bring in a couple of alternate colours. We're probably not quite there yet, but we're close. CE: Some MG models have a full suite of active safety technology like the ZS, HS and MG 3, but others like the MG 5 don't. Can we expect to see greater consistency moving forward with your safety technology strategy in Australia? GB: The MG 5 was launched a few years ago now, when probably the brand was in a different place. Moving forward, we will see I suppose a more standardised, higher level of safety in every single MG we bring to the country. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer We've looked at it. We've discussed it with our parent company. They're supportive. So I believe that will be our trajectory moving forward. CE: Does that mean that the MG 5 won't be sticking around? GB: We're going to bring to market this year a much improved safety specification in that car. Not sure of the timing yet, but it will be later this year. CE: And will that bring a full suite of active safety technology? GB: I'm probably not able to specify exactly what it is right now, but it will bring the vehicle up to a kind of standard in its segment. CE: Is there still a plan for the MG 3 to get a safety upgrade? GB: Later this year. So, our parent company is super supportive when it comes to safety and the requirements of the Australian market. So when we go to them with requests, they're generally very supportive and act as quickly as they can. So we'll bring those two cars with improved safety specification later this year. Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer Expert Insights: Q&A with Giles Belcher, MG Australia's chief commercial officer CE: MG parent company SAIC Motor also has the LDV brand, which is distributed locally by an independent company. So far the two brands have offered different products but, now you're going to introduce a ute, how does SAIC feel about having two offerings in the same market? GB: Look, I can't speak for them, to be honest, but when you think about the amount of utes on offer in the Australian market these days, the fact that LDV and MG are related brands at a head office level is kind of irrelevant, really. We're two players in a much broader market. So I don't see that particular issue. CE: But LDV is known for being a commercial vehicle brand, whereas MG isn't. So why would somebody choose to buy an MG ute over an LDV ute? GB: I think, for the same reason I was saying before over any [other] brand – our history, our warranty, our confidence, our network. It's the same reason they would buy a ZS over another small SUV. It's no different.

Following President Donald Trump's inauguration and the appointment of Elon Musk to oversee the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the world has been following the dramatic cuts and rapid reforms made to the American system of government. Within a matter of days, Musk announced the administration would be cutting thousands of government jobs, claiming they constituted unnecessary spending, and thereby adding billions of dollars to the federal budget as a result of the cuts. Many in Israel – where our cumbersome public sector is often much maligned – have watched these developments with excitement, calling for the same approach here. On the face of it, the idea of importing the DOGE model to Israel might make sense. Who wouldn't want to cut excess public spending and divert funds to where they are truly needed? And who doesn't want a lean government that works effectively on behalf of the public? But when we take a closer look at the characteristics of the Israeli government, we find that directly copying the American model would not only be insufficient at solving the fundamental problems afflicting the public sector; it might actually make it even more difficult to address them. Elon Musk delivers a salute at a Trump immigration rally. Inset: Musk's Holocaust joke post. (credit: screenshot) In the US, DOGE is focusing mainly on improving economic efficiency by mapping pockets of waste, that is, locating budgetary allocations deemed as unnecessary and wasteful expenditures, or those that (according to Musk) the state should not be funding. The temptation to locate such items in Israel's state budget is, as stated, very great. However, a closer look at our budget reveals that Israel's pockets of waste are highly visible and easily found – in the very structure of our executive branch, and in the political, coalitional, and sectoral funds handed out by the government. These are funds, identified as part of the agreement to build a coalition (or thereafter), which are allocated to projects and initiatives that serve the narrow interests of sectoral parties and their voters. In the US, such funds would be known as pork barrel. Looking for common-sense solutions ANYONE WAVING the banner of efficiency and calling for an Israeli DOGE should look for common-sense solutions to the problems lurking in plain sight. First, it is impossible to ignore one of the clearest illustrations of political waste in Israel: the extreme proliferation of government ministries, which has been carried out entirely for political reasons. There are currently 31 government ministries in Israel – a highly inflated number compared to other countries, which make do with between 15 and 20 ministries. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter This proliferation leads to a direct waste of public funds in the form of inflated staffing and operating budgets. No less importantly, there is the indirect waste of resources and inefficiency resulting from problems of synchronization, overlap, and coordination among the various ministries that are repeatedly established, dismantled, and reassembled. This waste is estimated at hundreds of millions of shekels a year. The wastefulness in our budgets – and the common-sense solutions to these problems – are also plain to see. Just over the past couple of weeks, the government approved NIS 5 billion, in coalitional funds, on top of countless previous transfers. The vast majority of these funds serve narrow political interests and use up major resources that could have been directed to the important and significant needs of the entire Israeli public. Thus, while in the American DOGE the focus is on the elimination of government jobs and agencies, a key challenge in Israel is to reduce the huge budgets that are funneled to specific sectors for political and coalitional reasons. These funds can be easily located by tracking their transfer to countless nonprofits, yeshivas, and organizations that operate mainly in the national religious, haredi, and settler communities. MOREOVER, IT would be a mistake to limit the discussion of an Israeli DOGE to the narrow lens of waste and unnecessary budget allocations. The main problem in the public sector in Israel is not necessarily that it is extravagant or particularly bloated, but rather its low level of performance. In other words, our core systemic problems are not only related to efficiency but to effectiveness – the low-performance level of government systems, such that existing resources are not properly utilized and implemented. Thus, those seeking to improve the work of the government should look not only at budgetary allocations but also at the basic components that make our public service cumbersome and ineffective. Such improvements should include improving the quality of human capital in the public sector, including recruitment and retention practices; improving budgeting, procurement, and government contracting processes; radically upgrading public digitization and information management systems; and improving work environments. Without a multi-pronged approach of this kind, which would essentially constitute a broad and multidimensional reform of the public service, locating budgetary pockets of waste will remain a purely cosmetic move. Eliminating wasteful government spending must come alongside improvements to government systems. The need for public service reform has been discussed for many years and its various components have been presented to successive governments over the years. Many politicians have championed this cause during their campaigns, only to abandon it once in office when facing pressure from narrow political interests. Unfortunately, we have not seen the emergence of political leadership willing and able to move such an important national undertaking forward. Perhaps the winds of change blowing in from America will motivate our politicians to launch a historic project of improving and streamlining our public service. But for such a project to succeed, the model will have to be adapted to the Israeli case, and its implementation focused on our unique problems: updating the structure of the government and the number of ministries, significantly reducing political and coalitional funds, and instituting a courageous reform to increase the effectiveness of the public service. This is the DOGE model we need in Israel.|2025-03-16|https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-846159
A new Idaho House bill has passed the House as an alternative plan for cutting Idaho's ties with WWAMI. HB 368 passed the House, 46-21, three excused, on Thursday, March 13. The bill was introduced March 5, proposed as an alternative to HB 176, which would cut Idaho's involvement in the multi-state medical education partnership including Washington, Wyoming, Alaska and Montana. The new bill continues the plan to decrease Idaho's involvement WWAMI but will not eliminate it completely. Beginning in the 2026-27 school year, the number of seats reserved for Idaho students at non-WWAMI programs would increase by 10 each year until the total reaches 30. Beginning in the 2027-28 school year, the number of seats reserved for Idaho students in the WWAMI program would decrease by at least 10. In summary, year one would see an increase of 10 non-WWAMI seats; year two would have an increase of 10 non-WWAMI seats and a decrease of 10 WWAMI seats; year three would have the final increase of 10 non-WWAMI seats. The bill also requires that the state Board of Education create a working group to develop a plan for medical education in Idaho, with a deadline of Jan. 2, 2026, for the plan to be delivered to the governor and legislature. The plan will address undergraduate and graduate medical education programs, maximize Idaho-based clinical and residency program placements and minimize conflicts with different education programs. This is all with the aim to reduce the physician shortage in Idaho. Rep. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello, led the March 12 House Education Committee discussion. Idaho faces a critical need for more physicians, particularly in rural and underserved areas, he said. House Bill 368 is a serious attempt and a serious effort to strengthen Idaho's medical workforce, expanding training opportunities and improving cost efficiency while fostering strategic partnerships that align with Idaho's long-term healthcare needs. If we are going to spend more money…we should make sure we are going to get better results, more quality Idaho doctors. This bill, House Bill 368, allows WWAMI to be part of that solution, while we also invest outside of WWAMI, Manwaring said. WWAMI can be a part of this…but it cannot and should not be the only way we support undergraduate medical education in our state. Dr. Mary Barinaga, an Idaho family doctor and WWAMI graduate, works with WWAMI to create clinical partnerships with practicing Idaho doctors. WWAMI is committed to figuring out how we expand medical education in Idaho, Barinaga said. We are asking to be part of the solution. To do this, we ask that the program, that WWAMI stays stable, so we can maintain the clinical training sites in Idaho…We are asking that the state Board of Education be given a strong mandate to develop a medical student growth plan involving WWAMI, Utah and other potential partners who can help grow medical education in Idaho, for Idaho. Barinaga also mentioned the public response to HB 176. By raising concerns about physician shortages and asking how or why WWAMI hasn't grown, the sponsors have actually caused dozens of doctors around the state to step forward to ask how they can help. When asked about the financial aspect of WWAMI, Barinaga cited a University of Idaho study. For every dollar that is invested into Idaho WWAMI, our state gets back $5.10, she said. The committee also heard from Dr. Benjamin Chan, Associate Dean of Admissions and Associate Dean of Idaho Affairs at the University of Utah School of Medicine. We're eager and excited to work with our potential new partners at the University of Idaho…We've built up other programs such as rural outreach, pipeline programs, our ambassador programs. We send our Idaho students back to Idaho as much as we can. Chan emphasized the importance of increasing the number of students that go on to practice in Idaho. I was just in a meeting the other day with our Idaho students as well as our Utah students…When these 50 students expressed interest in doing any type of activities or rotations back in Idaho, our goal is to get them back to Idaho as well. In 2019, the CDC reported Idaho had the lowest per-capita number of physicians across all 50 states, with 19.0 per 10,000 residents. HB 176 has been stalled in the House since Feb. 17 due to widespread public backlash from doctors, students, legislators and community members alike. Both bills were sponsored by Rep. Manwaring and Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star.|2025-03-16|https://www.uiargonaut.com/2025/03/15/representative-presents-new-plan-to-reduce-wwami-involvement/
I had originally planned this update for April, but I finished the update sooner than I expected. So, here we are with the last planned update for the Noob's GRID Graphics Mod! With the rework of Le Mans, this mod is finally complete. But the last planned update doesn't mean this mod is dead or abandoned. I just don't have anything to add anymore, since it does what a graphics mod should and then some. Now it's time for some emotional speech. When I first released this mod in 2022, it was honestly kinda random. At the September of Last year, I started working on it again after 2 years. And somehow this mod snowballed into a popularity that I didn't expected. So, thank you all for your support, I truly appreciated it! [Here is the new stuff with the 4.0 release]: -Reworked the Lighting of the Le Mans circuit -Small lighting rework to Jarama -All of the tracks are polished and fixed for one last time -New bonus content: Extra depth of field effects -New bonus content: Yokohama ProStreet Lighting [Reworked Le Mans] Le Mans was the final piece for the complete version of this mod. And it's here with a new glorious look! Here is the full day night cycle of Circuit de la Sarthe! Le Mans [Track Fixes] I learned how to mod the game's lighting as I go, you could say I was a noob (haha). So I left some small oversights here and there. Like incorrect smoke color (Thanks cyborg009). A consequence of this, I realised my old interpretation of the Jarama lighting was wrong because of incorrect sky brightness. Now it's more faithful to the original. Yokohamaf GRID13 [New Bonus Content] Going with the theme of copying other games's looks, I added Yokohama ProStreet Lighting . It creplicates the look of Tokyo Docks from Need for Speed ProStreet. Yokohama ProStreet But I think the main event is the Extra Depth of field effects . I toyed with the idea at my DIRT Graphics Mod, but scrapped it due being useless and horrible. I was going to scrap it for this mod too, but I found great uses for it! And from what I saw, this is the first time it's used like that in a mod, let's take a look!

If you're tired of paying for cable, this person might just have a solution for you. It's called a vSeeBox. But what is it—and is it legal? Featured Video What's a vSeeBox? In a recent video, @blind_momofboys shares about how their family recently cut cable costs. A vSeeBox, have u heard of one of those? she begins. We got rid of cable, we got rid of all monthly subscriptions and everything and we got one of those. Advertisement She shares how these boxes are available for purchase at Walmart and Amazon. Now we're not paying for cable, we're not paying Netflix, for anything, but we have it all, she says. We have Hulu, we have Disney, we have everything, everything all because of a little box. The video has over 8,000 likes and 436,000 views as of Saturday. The vSeeBox @blind_momofboys is referring to is easily accessible at many stores as mentioned. In simple terms, it's a device that connects to a TV and streams content from the internet, as their website states. Advertisement It comes preloaded with apps and you can download more, just like a Roku or Apple TV device. However, a major difference is that vSeeBoxes also allows you to watch airway channels like the news, not just content streamed from apps. Is it legal? The answer is kind of. While it's not a illegal to own a vSeeBox and the website does say that you need to sign on to the apps with your account to stream it, but there are ways around it. It's not exactly clear how the box does this. Some forums have people giving their techy input on the device about the apps the device comes with, the Heat Apps . Using [the Heat Apps] to access live TV besides over-the-air channels is a grey area because you're accessing illegally streamed content. While technically it may not be illegal to stream this content, it is illegal to download the content and from the sounds of it, the Vsee boxes are actually downloading the programming to allow for DVR-type playback, one person wrote. Advertisement The Daily Dot has previously covered the legality of other streaming devices like Amazon Fire Stick and how it could result in jail time if not used properly. Viewers in the comments weigh in on their experience with the box. We have one! Love it! No subscriptions needed. Also called the Superbox. Same thing, one comment read. I have a superbox, love it, it's like having 1700 channels, HBO, but it doesn't have Netflix oe hulu…just need wifi, someone else says. Advertisement It's amazing but sometimes it freezes. Some movies or shows don't load as well. You can watch movies that are still in theaters!!! We have had ours for a year! Love it, another mentioned. It is difficult to find reliable sources about how the vSeeBox functions since a lot of its features people boast about (like streaming live cable without paying for it) are illegal. The Daily Dot has reached out to vSeeBox for comment via email and to the creator for comment via TikTok message and comment.|2025-03-16|https://www.dailydot.com/news/what-is-vsee-box/
- Advertisement - Featured Expert Pouneh Razavi, M.D. of John Hopkins Annual mammograms are the best way to detect breast cancer early when treatment is most effective. Yet changing federal guidance about the recommended age to start getting mammograms — from 40 to 50 and now back to 40 again — can be confusing. Pouneh Razavi, M.D., director of breast imaging in the National Capital Region, oversees breast imaging operations at the Sullivan Breast Center at Sibley Memorial Hospital and Johns Hopkins Medical Imaging in Bethesda. She cuts through the clutter with clear advice for breast cancer screenings. Q: What are the latest federal guidelines for breast cancer screenings? A: In May 2023, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force changed its guidance to recommend that women begin getting annual mammograms at age 40. That reverses its 2009 recommendation, which raised the start age from 40 to 50. Q: Why did the guidelines for mammogram age change from 50 to 40 in 2023? A: Data shows that 1 out of 6 new breast cancers develop in people who are in the age range of 40 to 50. Cancers detected during screenings are usually in the early stage, and the earlier we catch cancer, the better the prognosis and survival rate for the patient. At Johns Hopkins, we have always recommended that our patients start screening at age 40. Q: Why did the recommended age for mammograms change from 40 to 50 in 2009? A: Guidelines were changed to age 50 in 2009 partly because of concerns that mammograms starting at age 40 would subject more women to unnecessary false positives, requiring them to go back for additional screenings or even biopsies. Those concerns are real but must be weighed against the benefits of finding cancers earlier. Q: Can false positives be reduced in mammograms? A: At Johns Hopkins Medicine, the only clinicians who read breast imaging are radiologists who have been fellowship trained in breast imaging. This helps us keep our false positive rates down across the whole Johns Hopkins system. Studies show that when you have radiologists dedicated to reading mammograms, as opposed to a wide range of screenings, they tend to flag fewer mammograms for follow-up, and the ones they flag turn out to be true positives. To keep false positive rates down, we also encourage consultations among the radiologists who read the scans. Q: Should some people start getting mammograms before the age of 40? A: Yes. We always tell patients to have this conversation with their gynaecologist or referring physician. For example, patients with a higher-than-average risk, such as those who have a family history of breast cancer or genetic factors such as a mutation of the BRCA gene, are generally urged to start earlier. Q: Is there an age when people no longer need breast cancer screenings? A: The new guidelines do not include recommendations for women after age 74, as there is limited data on whether mammograms save lives in that age group. But we have patients who are much older than that and healthy, who would benefit from early detection that would inform treatment decisions. As long as the patient is in good health otherwise, we recommend that they continue getting annual mammograms. Q: What is the current mammogram guidance for patients with dense breasts? A: In March 2023, the Food and Drug Administration updated its regulations, requiring that mammography facilities notify patients about the density of their breasts so they can consult with their physicians about whether additional screening is needed. Dense breasts can make cancers more difficult to detect. All Johns Hopkins sites offer 3D mammography, which gives us much more information because it lets us see the layers of tissue, 1 millimeter at a time. Q: Should people keep their old mammogram images? A: Mammography works best when we can compare new images to older ones. We ask our patients to please bring any previous mammogram images to a new mammogram appointment at our facility. Comparing current mammogram images to prior images can be very helpful in assessing for a change. Even if you had a mammogram 15 years ago and you don't think it's useful, it is.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/mammogram-age-guidelines-what-you-need-to-know/
Credit: Stefan Jeremiah, AP NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Columbia University concealed illegal aliens on its campus, one of its top officials said Friday, as the Trump administration intensified its campaign to deport foreigners who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at Columbia University last year. A people gathered in Foley Square, outside the Manhattan federal court, in support of Mahmoud Khalil, Wednesday, March 12, 2025, in New York Credit: Stefan Jeremiah, AP NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether Columbia University hid students sought by US The Trump administration intensified its campaign to deport foreigners who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations at the school last year. Agents with the Department of Homeland Security searched two university residences with a warrant Thursday evening. No one was arrested, and it was unclear whom the authorities were searching for. But by Friday afternoon, U.S. officials had announced developments related to two people they had pursued in connection with the demonstrations. A Columbia doctoral student from India whose visa was revoked by the Trump administration fled the U.S. on an airliner. And a Palestinian woman who had been arrested during the protests at the university last April was arrested by federal immigration authorities in Newark, New Jersey, on charges that she overstayed an expired visa. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, speaking at the Justice Department, said it was all part of the president's mission to end antisemitism in this country. Just last night, we worked with the Department of Homeland Security to execute search warrants from an investigation into Columbia University for harboring and concealing illegal aliens on its campus, Blanche said. That investigation is ongoing, and we are also looking at whether Columbia's handling of earlier incidents violated civil rights laws and included terrorism crimes. Blanche didn't say what evidence agents had of wrongdoing by the university. It was unclear whether he was accusing the school itself of terrorism crimes or saying that people involved in the protests had committed such crimes. The Associated Press left messages seeking comment from the university about Blanche's accusations Friday. In a note to the school community following the searches Thursday night, interim university president Katrina Armstrong said Columbia was committed to upholding the law. She described herself as heartbroken that federal agents had been on campus searching student rooms. I understand the immense stress our community is under, Armstrong wrote. Despite the unprecedented challenges, Columbia University will remain a place where the pursuit of knowledge is cherished and fiercely protected, where the rule of law and due process is respected and never taken for granted, and where all members of our community are valued and able to thrive. Columbia has come under immense pressure from the Trump administration in recent weeks, with the U.S. government canceling $400 million in federal grants and contracts to the school, much of it for medical research, as punishment for not cracking down harder on students and faculty who criticized Israel's military action in Gaza during large protests last spring. President Donald Trump and other officials have accused the protesters as being pro-Hamas, referring to the militant group that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The administration threatened to permanently end federal funding to the Ivy League school unless it took a variety of steps, including changing its admissions process and ceding faculty control of its Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department to a receiver for five years. It also demanded that the school ban people from wearing masks on campus, change how it recruits international students, adopt a new definition of antisemitism, and abolish its student disciplinary process. Students and faculty who participated in last year's protests at Columbia have insisted that criticizing Israel and advocating for Palestinian rights isn't antisemitic. Some Jewish students and faculty, though, complained that the anti-Israel rhetoric made them feel unsafe. Columbia University's campus has been in crisis since the arrest Saturday of Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist who helped lead last spring's protests. The Trump administration said Friday it had revoked the visa of Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian citizen and doctoral student at Columbia, for advocating for violence and terrorism. Srinivasan opted to self-deport Tuesday, the department said. Officials didn't say what evidence they had that Srinivasan had advocated violence. Her lawyers denied the accusations, and she told The New York Times that she wasn't involved in organizing any Columbia protests. According to the newspaper, the Department of Homeland Security said Srinivasan didn't disclose two protest-related summonses on her visa renewal application last year. Srinivasan told the newspaper she had received the summonses — for allegedly refusing to disperse and obstructing foot or vehicle traffic — after simply getting caught up in a crowd of protesters while trying to return to her apartment from a picnic last year. She said she left the summonses off her renewal form because her case had been dismissed. The woman who was arrested in Newark, Leqaa Kordia, was charged with failing to leave the U.S. after her visa expired. Columbia said it had no record of Kordia ever being a student there or being arrested on the campus. However, there were numerous protests and arrests in the streets outside of the university at the same time. Kordia had previously received a student visa, but it was terminated in 2022 for lack of attendance, the department said. She is being held in an immigration detention center in Alvarado, Texas, according to a government database. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Friday the Trump administration is expecting to revoke more student visas in the coming days. ____ Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in La Malbaie, Quebec, contributed to this report.

Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning The airstrikes come days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. This image provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen March 15, 2025 Credit: U.S. Navy via AP WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in Sanaa and in the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

The search for chametz (leavened bread) is the start of many Passover rituals observed over the springtime festival. Houses are combed by their owners to ensure no chametz was overlooked during the Passover cleaning. Yet a curious detail of the law requires that the search be conducted specifically at night and just a candle (today, many use a flashlight) for light to reveal the unnoticed chametz. The Sages explained that searches are best done at night in the dark with a focused light. The smallest light in the darkest room provides the best light for finding small and hidden objects. The lesson of the small and focused light in the darkest rooms is a lesson often extended to other areas of life. Currently, the Jewish people and the Land of Israel sit in a dark room. We have suffered a harsh and humiliating attack by a smaller and weaker force. Over a thousand were slaughtered, thousands were wounded, and hundreds were kidnapped. The country was forced to war where hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers went out to fight, tens of thousands of Israelis were displaced, thousands of soldiers were injured, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. This is a dark time for the Jewish people; it is a time when we need light. Israel has seen similar dark times in its history. The Jews were enslaved by the Egyptians for over 200 years, struck by the Amalekites as they traversed the desert, seduced by Moabite women and punished by God, and subjugated in their own land by foreign enemies. Israeli women look at a poster with pictures of victims of the deadly October 7, 2023 attack by Hamas, in Reim (credit: NIR ELIAS/REUTERS) The Babylonians and Romans sacked Jerusalem, killed millions of Jews, and exiled the rest. Arab invaders nearly completed the job, almost totally emptying the land of its Jews as they colonized Judea, which was renamed Palestine by the descendants of the Romans they defeated. In more modern times, Crusades, pogroms, and the Holocaust ravaged the Jewish people, killing tens of millions of Jews over the years. AFTER THOUSANDS of years of agonizing torment, light shined again for the Jewish people. Over fifty years of hard work on the land and in the halls of governments worldwide bore fruit when God blessed the Jews, and they reestablished a Jewish state in its historic homeland, Eretz Yisrael, the Land of Israel. They were once again masters of their own destinies. Unlike their brothers and sisters in Europe who had nowhere to find refuge in their darkest hour, when 800,000 Jews in Arab lands were forced from the places they called home for over a thousand years, they found refuge in the newly established Jewish State of Israel. In the brightest of times, there was still darkness. Unwilling to accept the rejuvenation of the Jewish people in the Jews' native land, the Arab armies attacked the new Jewish state. Thousands of Jews – over 1% of the total population – were killed in the ensuing War of Independence (1948-49). But with God's help, the Jewish people survived. Over the next two decades, thousands of Jews would lose their lives to Arab and Palestinian terror attacks. In 1967, Israel's light shined brighter with a crushing victory over their Arab neighbors in the Six Day War. Israel quadrupled in size, taking control of the Biblical heartlands it was denied at their founding in 1948. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Yet, more darkness would come when the Arab enemies desecrated the Jewish people's most sacred day in a despicable surprise attack on Yom Kippur. In the 1973 war, Israel lost over 2,000 soldiers, and it took three weeks for the country to regain control and defeat its enemies. Remember that Israel is still a thriving success TODAY, ISRAEL is a thriving success. It deregulated and privatized its economy, leading to a Start-up Nation of hi-tech success paralleled by Silicon Valley. Israel's economy has remained strong throughout many global downturns, and it tops the world in healthcare, education, and happiness. The country's success is coveted by leaders around the region and the world. Israel's Democratic government is the envy of its Arab neighbors whose tyrannical dictators don't allow their people to enjoy the freedoms the average Israeli citizen – Jew, Arab, Druze, and Bedouin – takes for granted. While the past year and a half has been a dark time for the Jewish people, the past few months have not been completely dark. There are shining lights in the night of the Jewish tragedy that have shown through the darkness. Israel has successfully defeated, or is on its way to doing so, seven different foes on seven different fronts. It has weakened Hamas, Hezbollah, ISIS, the Houthis, Iran, Iraqi militias, and Syria's military. It has seen the return of a hundred hostages and begun rebuilding the South and the North from the destruction suffered there. The Jewish people and the State of Israel have begun their rehabilitation. Today's light in Israel is a thin ray, but it shines in a dark night. Israel and the Jewish people have a bright future. God has helped them survive painful tragedies like the Simchat Torah massacre of October 7, and God will help the Jewish people survive this tragedy as well. Israel has proven itself more resilient than any other nation that has walked this land, and its resilience will lead to brighter days. From the Jewish people's darkest periods have come their brightest days. After the Egyptian slavery came the giving of the Torah and the conquering of the Land of Israel; after the persecution of Haman came Israel's second commonwealth; and from the ashes of the Holocaust came today's State of Israel. I pray that from the darkness of the Simchat Torah massacre comes the brightest of days for the Jewish people; may God make it so for the Jewish people.|2025-03-16|https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-846161

FORT BRAGG, CA — At the City Council meeting on Monday, March 10, 2025, the only item on the agenda was a review of the proposed Mill Site Master Development Plan. The question for council members was whether the rough draft plan looked promising enough to be a good faith resolution to the lawsuit against Mendocino Railway or if the city should return to court now that the legal stay had ended. The meeting opened with Mayor Godeke, who provided time for the public to comment on the litigation before the upcoming closed session about the status of the city's lawsuit. Mendocino Railway President and CEO Robert Pinoli and Sierra Railroad Vice President Chris Hart were also present to answer questions. City Manager Isaac Whippy opened the meeting's agenda item by explaining how the two litigating sides had come together to resolve their differences during the court-ordered stay. A planning team was put together with Isaac Whippy, planning consultant Walter Keiser, consultant Marie Jones, two assistants, Chris Hart, and architect Burton Miller. Whippy stressed that no binding decisions had been made and that the City Council Ad Hoc Committee had been kept informed. He then turned to Walter Keiser and Marie Jones to lay out the details of the team's Mill Site Phase 1 Development Strategy Report to the council and an audience of about 50 people. Keiser spent substantial time explaining how the Phase 1 Plan was just a starting point for finding common ground between the two sides regarding potential plans for land use. He stressed, You have to start somewhere, in response to public concerns that the team's planning decisions had been set without any further public input. He explained the flow chart the team had developed for the decision-making process and who and what was included in each step or decision. Phase 1 is completed with agreement on the structure of a continued planning process and clarified understanding of some basic constraints on both parties. Stakeholders from other agencies were also contacted to provide input on the latest map. Concerning the development maps presented at the February 25 town hall meeting, Keiser stated that about 80% of the new map's development plans were derived from the map given to the public in 2018 and 2019. Although there are still site-specific constraints to work out, Keiser reported that there is now agreement that 93% of the entire property will be under city and state jurisdiction. The remaining 7% will be under the control of Mendocino Railway and all its relevant binding federal regulations. Phase 2 is intended to lead to an agreement describing a holistic view, laying out potential development, and identifying the benefits for all groups. Also included would be a description of all actions, needed investments, and third-party regulation requirements and how they will be met. An agreement for a Memo of Understanding (MOU) would then be developed to determine how the interests of the city, the railway, and the California Coastal Commission can be met. At this point, all parties would need to commit to settling the suit, identify funding, and agree on real estate transactions. Keiser stated that this complicated phase would need a second lawsuit court stay of six months to gather all the information needed. He stressed that an MOU would happen only if all the different issues seen feasible to be solved. As an example, he noted that the remediation of Mill Pond #8 would cost about $30 million, perhaps double that. He added, The burden of financing generally falls to the property owner. Phase 3 would involve land use approvals, regulatory clearances, a financing plan, and real estate transactions, such as city acquisition of land for a nature area. All during this process, which Keiser estimated would take two years, there would be public hearings and the creation of a project management team. Nothing would be final until the entire project is approved first by the City Planning Commission and then sent to City Council for approval. A final public hearing for city adoption would then take place. Keiser noted that if the City Council does adopt the final development plan, Phase 4 will take years to evolve, meaning that developers would need to come in and purchase parcels. Chris Hart then spoke about the Mendocino Railway's desire to find a resolution, although he commented that he believed the railway would win the Superior Court lawsuit. He noted all the concessions the railway has already made to the city and that more were possible. He described Phase 1 as only talking about planning with no decisions made. He also stressed that both sides need confidence in each other. At the request of the City Council, Mendocino Railway President and CEO Robert Pinoli explained the layers of federal oversight that bind the railway's infrastructure, proper maintenance, and adherence to inspection recommendations from a variety of federal and state agencies. He noted that since 9/11, even TSA now has a regulatory role in the railway's operations. City Council members were then given time to ask Pinoli and Hart questions as long as the questions did not entail closed session litigation issues. One question ended up being asked multiple times through the night. Would Mendocino Railway be bound by the final Master Development Agreement if approved by the city? Both Chris Hart and Walter Keiser pointed out that a signed contract legally binds the parties. Hart suggested that city inspectors should participate and advise. Pinoli stressed that Mendocino Railway complies with all the multiple laws that regulate it and that, as a public utility, it is not bound by city permit regulations. A few council members' questions related to the planned track extension to Glass Beach and the trolley station. Lindy Peters noted that the train tracks and trolley station would interfere with the coastal trail. He then asked if the railway would alter the map if the community really wants it. Hart responded, There will be trade-offs. Marie Jones, who has been working on the city's behalf for many years, wisely commented that negotiations mean nobody is going to be completely happy. The meeting was then opened up to a second session of public comment. Many who spoke advised the city to slow down. Some also recommended a discovery process first to get all the facts to protect the city from any possible rogue action from the other party. Many wanted assurance that the public would be involved at every step, including the Sherwood Pomo Band. During the time allotted to phone-in comments, Alex Helperin, an assistant counsel for the California Coastal Commission, expressed his dissatisfaction with comments made by Mendocino Railway's lawyer at the February 25 town hall. He stated that Nilsson had misled the public as to the Commission's interests and involvement in the lawsuit. As an example, he pointed to Nilsson's statement that the goal of the California Coastal Commission was to shut down the Skunk Train. Helperin stated, We never sought to do that or said anything that ever suggested we had any interest in doing that. We simply want to make sure the railway abides by the city's coastal program and Coastal Act. At the conclusion of the meeting, Council member Lindy Peters expressed his willingness to work with Mendocino Railway and clarified his long time position which has been interpreted by some as anti-train. He described a few land use projects he had repeatedly favored and promoted, such as a small dairy and a small mill. He then said, We're not enemies. I have to think of the long term for future citizens in Fort Bragg to sustain themselves. The City Council then went into closed session for discussions with its attorney about the next step to take in the litigation lawsuit.|2025-03-16|https://www.advocate-news.com/2025/03/13/city-council-considers-mill-site-plan-amid-lawsuit/
According to reports, these strikes mark only the opening salvo of a broader U.S. campaign against the Iran-backed terrorist group, which has recently resumed threats against Israel and ships bound for its ports via the Red Sea. A U.S. official told Reuters that the strikes are expected to continue for at least several days, possibly even weeks. (Video: Reuters) US strikes in Sanaa, Yemen The operation marks a major shift in U.S. policy compared to that of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden. The goal is to punish the Houthis for directly targeting Western naval vessels in the Red Sea while also exerting indirect pressure on Tehran over its nuclear program. Iran has so far refused to negotiate with Trump under his policy of sanctions and military threats. The strikes also aim to weaken Iran's ability to operate its regional proxies. Additionally, economic considerations are a key factor, as the U.S. seeks to ensure the safe passage of oil tankers from the Persian Gulf to Europe. While the Biden administration did conduct airstrikes against the Houthis, it refrained from a proactive military campaign, fearing a wider regional war. However, following the collapse of Iran's axis—including Hezbollah's heavy losses in Lebanon and the fall of the Assad regime in Syria—the Trump administration appears unafraid of such an escalation. תקיפה בצנעא, תימן / US strikes in Sanaa, Yemen (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) / View gallery תקיפה בצנעא, תימן / US strikes in Sanaa, Yemen (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) The U.S. targeted Houthi radar systems, air defense installations and missile batteries, with the Trump administration's goal being to reopen international shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Local reports indicated that the United Kingdom also participated in the strikes. U.S. officials described this as the most significant military operation of Trump's short second term, intended as a warning to Iran as well. According to Arab media reports, the strikes in Sana'a hit an airport, a television station and a Houthi command-and-control center. The attacks concentrated on the Al-Jiraf neighborhood, where most Houthi operatives are based. A local source told Ynet that the area is akin to Hezbollah's stronghold in Beirut's Dahieh district. U.S. reports indicate that the strikes, aimed at the Houthis' vast weapons stockpiles—some of which are buried underground—could last several days, possibly weeks, and may escalate depending on the Houthis' response. מבוא ביתר / Houthi missile debris crashes on top of Mevo Beitar home in January (Photo: REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun) / View gallery מבוא ביתר / Houthi missile debris crashes on top of Mevo Beitar home in January (Photo: REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun) (Photo: REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun) The New York Times also noted that some National Security Council advisers are pushing for even more aggressive strikes to force the Houthis to relinquish significant territory in northern Yemen. Senior Houthi official Nasruddin Amer responded to the U.S. offensive on X, writing: Sana'a will remain Gaza's shield and support. It will not abandon it, no matter the challenges. Another Houthi Supreme Political Council member told Qatar's Al Araby channel: Our attacks in the Red Sea will continue. Trump to Houthis: 'Your time is up' Trump announced Saturday night that he had ordered a decisive military operation against Houthi militants in Yemen. Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen, he wrote on his Truth Social platform. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones. Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. חות'ים במפגן תמיכה בעזה ב צנעא תימן 20 בדצמבר / Houthis at a pro-Gaza rally in Sana'a, Yemen, December 20, 2023 (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) / View gallery חות'ים במפגן תמיכה בעזה ב צנעא תימן 20 בדצמבר / Houthis at a pro-Gaza rally in Sana'a, Yemen, December 20, 2023 (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) (Photo: REUTERS/Khaled Abdullah) According to Trump, It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump emphasized. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. Trump then issued a direct warning: To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! Turning to Iran, Trump warned: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!|2025-03-16|https://www.ynetnews.com/article/hjdvlu7nyl

March 15 (UPI) -- A Los Angeles man won a $50 million judgment against Starbucks for burns that he suffered while moving a tray of very hot drinks at a Starbucks location in southern California in 2020. Postmates driver Michael Garcia sued Starbucks after being burned when a scalding hot cup of tea spilled into his lap after a Starbucks worker handed him a tray containing three venti-sized hot-tea drinks through the drive-through window of the Exposition Park Starbucks at 1789 W. Jefferson Blvd. Advertisement Garcia said a Starbucks barista acted negligently by not properly securing the drink and its lid in the drinks tray, which he said caused the drink to spill and burn him within 1.4 seconds of receiving it. Garcia said he suffered life-changing third-degree burns, nerve damage and permanent injuries to his genitals and has PTSD following the mishap. His attorney, Nicholas Rowley, told jurors Garcia has undergone several surgeries and experiences pain every day. Michael Garcia's life has been forever changed, Rowley said in a statement after the jury verdict and award were announced. No amount of money can undo the permanent catastrophic harm he has suffered, Rowley said, but this jury verdict is a critical step in holding Starbucks accountable for flagrant disregard for customer safety and failure to accept responsibility. Advertisement The jury deliberated Friday for 40 minutes before delivering its verdict and awarding Garcia $50 million in damages. Rowley called the verdict reasonable and said Starbucks engaged in gross negligence that caused Garcia to suffer life-changing injuries. A Starbucks spokesperson told CBS News Los Angeles the national coffee chain disagrees with the jury verdict and intends to file an appeal. We sympathize with Mr. Garcia, but we disagree with the jury's decision that we were at fault for this incident and believe the damages awarded to be excessive, the statement says. We plan to appeal, it continues. We have always been committed to the highest safety standards in our stores, including the handling of hot drinks. Garcia said he was burned on Feb. 8, 2020, and sought treatment from the Grossman Burn Center in Los Angeles six days later. Treatments included skin grafts that caused Garcia to permanently lose feeling in affected body parts, Rowley argued in court while presenting evidence of Garcia's injuries during the trial. Starbucks offered to settle the matter for $3 million prior to the trial and afterward increased the settlement offer to $30 million, which Garcia accepted. Garcia also demanded Starbucks apologize, change its policies and notify all Starbucks locations to ensure all drinks are secure before giving them to customers.

Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. It was a very rough deal last night, he said Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night. Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. The amount of damage was catastrophic, Dillon said. It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over -- everything was destroyed. Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. Homes and everything were destroyed all around it, she said. Schools and buildings are just completely gone. Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral. Tad Peters and his dad, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists flee the interstate to park. Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it's here. It's here, Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ... His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us.

The state's Department of Consumer Protection has announced it has suspended the license of an online gaming provider that operated an illegal online casino in the state, officials said. According to the agency's gaming division, an investigation determined that High5Games, also illegally operated an unlicensed online casino, High5Casino. High5Casino was allegedly marketed by High5Games as a legal licensed casino and accepted wagers from Connecticut bettors, according to officials. FanDuel and DraftKings are the only two legal platforms licensed to accept online casino wagers from Connecticut consumers. They are both affiliated with Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods Casino, officials said. The DCP gaming division investigation determined that 1,100 Connecticut customers made deposits and gambled on the unlicensed High5Casino platform. Of those, 911 customers lost a total of $937,938, and 108 were individuals who had signed up for the voluntary self-exclusion list. Customers on the voluntary self-exclusion list lost nearly $300,000 on the platform. Self-exclusion allows a person to request to be excluded from legalized gaming activities in Connecticut. Individuals who enroll in self-exclusion are prohibited from collecting any winnings, recovering any losses or accepting complimentary gifts or services or any other thing of value from a licensee or operator. We are disappointed that a licensed gaming service provider took advantage of Connecticut consumers by operating an illegal casino platform, said DCP Gaming Division Director Kris Gilman. It is difficult to recover funds for consumers from illegal platforms. We remind consumers that gambling on licensed platforms is the only way to guarantee recovered funds in the event of an issue with a game or platform. High5Games, a majority owner of High5Casino, will be charged with 1,065 criminal counts of conducting illegal gaming activity, state officials said. Gaming division criminal investigators also said they will seek criminal charges for all of the violations of Connecticut's gaming laws. Each charge is a Class A misdemeanor carrying a penalty of up to one year in jail and a fine of up to $2,000. The DCP will seek restitution for eligible consumers who suffered a financial loss after being misled to believe that High5Casino was a legal form of gaming in Connecticut. Thank you to our Gaming Division team for their hard work to hold this licensee accountable, said DCP Commissioner Bryan T. Cafferelli. It is a privilege to hold this license, and we expect our credential holders to take that responsibility seriously. High5Games took advantage of their credential to mislead consumers into believing they were participating in gaming on a legal platform when, in fact, they were breaking the law. We remind consumers that there are only two licensed online casinos in Connecticut — DraftKings/Foxwoods and FanDuel/Mohegan Sun — and if you choose to participate in online gaming, you should only utilize one of the legal platforms licensed to operate in our state. If you or someone you know is looking for resources and support for problem gambling, call, or chat with the Connecticut Council on Problem Gaming 24/7 confidential Problem Gambling Helpline at 1(888) 789-7777 or visit www.ccpg.org. Information on services available in Connecticut for those who may have a gambling problem is also available at portal.ct.gov/problemgaming.

The San Diego Zoo celebrated the birth of a sloth pup on Feb. 8 to 12-year-old mother sloth, Xena. (Photo courtesy of San Diego Zoo) The San Diego Zoo welcomed the birth of a sloth pup in early February, making it the first of its species to be born there since 2022. The 12-year-old mother sloth, Xena, gave birth to her third pup on Feb. 8, according to a zoo announcement. A zoo spokesperson said the newborn will spend time with its mother over the next few months as it grows. Sloth mothers are very in tune with the needs of their newborns and will allow their pups to cling to their chest after birth so they can be cleaned off and nurse, the zoo spokesperson said. The newborn may join Xena during presentations at the Wildlife Explorers Basecamp when it's older, the announcement said. Xena has two other pups, Tornero and Colheita.|2025-03-16|https://timesofsandiego.com/life/2025/03/15/san-diego-zoo-celebrates-birth-of-baby-sloth-mamas-third-pup/
Did you know that Lufkin's first Walmart store was on Timberland Drive in the TownSquare Four shopping center? That was way before Walmart had groceries in Lufkin, Texas. Back then, Timberland Drive was the strip, and if you were on HWY 59, that meant you were going to Angelina College, Cotton Patch, Crown Colony, or Houston. There just wasn't that much out that way. Kicks 105 logo / Ollie's Bargains/canva/google Get our free mobile app I remember that once Walmart moved from Timberland to where Hobby Lobby is now, a new store came to Lufkin in the old location. Bud's Discount City was the precursor to what would eventually become Sam's. Bud's Reminds Me A Lot Of Ollie's Bargains Bud's, in the late 80s to early 90s, was a place to find a real bargain. They would just have pallets of stuff. They had overstocked Zenith hotel TVs for sale once, and I remember my dad being so proud of that purchase. We knew it was a hotel TV because it had audio outputs in the back, and I would eventually put some extra speakers on top. Long story short, Ollie's reminds me of Bud's. If you are a true bargain hunter and want that true overstock feeling, Ollie's is it in 2025, and they are coming to Lufkin. Ollie's Bargains Moving Into Former Big Lots In Lufkin According to the Lufkin Daily News, Ollie's Bargain Outlet has acquired 40 leases from former Big Lots locations, including the Lufkin location at 809 S Timberland. There is no word on exactly when they will start transitioning the location into an Ollie's Bargain Outlet, so that we can start shopping. Ollie's Sneak Peek: Lubbock's Exciting New Close-Out Department Store The team at Ollie's is working very hard to stock such a large store in time for their opening, so I was able to snap a few sneak peek photos of just a fraction of what will be on shelves when Ollie's opens.

I am a German game designer and programmer (C++) and have been working on this RPG and farm game for several years now, which I would like to introduce to you here. It is based on a nature simulation and the RPG part is an epic story (game duration between 50-200h), which extends over 5 chapters. The nature simulation serves as a base for the huge living world in which there is a lot to discover. The farm part in the game fits harmoniously into the rpg-gameplay and provides with housing, crafting, animal husbandry a lot of variety. Extensive underground areas filled with good and bad surprises offer excitement and challenges. Behind the horizon offers a long mystical story a long way from the usual Hero Saves the World . Rather it tells a story about the discovering of one's own nature and of the nature of the world. The community of Woodhome and the contact to the inhabitants plays an important role in the game. There are a lot of story lines concerning the Woodhome´s inhabitants. The nature simulation makes sure that no game is like the other and that the landscape changes every day. The weather and the seasons are also simulated and have a direct influence on nature and the player. There are even catastrophes and special events in the simulation, which can change the landscape sudddenly. In the settlements the NPCs go about their business and everyone can be talked to. The inhabitants have their own history and many need help or just want to chat a little. There are some difficult decisions to make and everything affects yourself, the world and the story. Friendship and romances are also not unknown in Behind the Horizon, but more shall not be revealed here ;-) ! Well over 50 cutscenes, which bring the story forward or breathe life into certain moments. Among them are events like learning new skills as well as visions and information about the stories. There are hundreds of items that you can find in the dark dungeons, buy from merchants, or make yourself. Potions, spells, all kinds of food and many other useful items can be built on the farm. There are numerous recipes for housing and also a lot of furniture at the local traders. Magic is also not unknown in Behind the Horizon and the exploration to find the origin of magic is a central point in the story. The combat system with 5 weapon types has over 30 spells. Many are also usefull while farming. Huge underground caves and dungeons with traps, labyrinths, treasures and many surprises await you. There are several boss enemies with sophisticated mechanics and also many annoying ;-) Trashmobs like the well known giant bats. Farming: You can cultivate many vegetable plants and also all wild plants and trees. Animals can be kept in enclosures or stables and also small, helping companions can be found and trained. All the plants that you harvest on your farm can be used for your own nutrition, for cooking and the making of spells and of course to get the desired coins to be able to buy some things from the traders of Woodhome. The mix between farming/RPG/exploring caves and housing is up to you, but it should be said that you can have a lot of variety. Just wandering through the nature after a season is over is always exciting to me. To see what has grown, what has died, how the course of the river has changed or where the quality of the earth has improved. System requirements: A Windows PC or Laptop (Windows 7/8/10) with 4GB memory or more. It runs smoothly on the newer Intel graphics chipsets. So hardware requirements rather moderate!|2025-03-16|https://www.indiedb.com/games/behind-the-horizon

For over 90 years, apprentices with Colorado Sheet Metal Workers have participated in the local St. Patrick's Day parade with a float built entirely by hand — continuing a legacy of craftsmanship that began in 1929. Creating the float each year is a year-round effort. Only weeks after Saturday's parade, the students will be back at it again thinking of next year's project. Anywhere from three to 20 students work on the float throughout the year, according to training coordinator Peter Carlson. Luke Cusato is in the final year of his apprenticeship and says he has worked on the float nearly every year. I like seeing other people that are just as passionate as me, Cusato said. Every year it's a different group of people working on the float. You get to talk to these people and see what interests them, what sparks their fire. Throughout his years in the program, Cusato says he has worked on close to 70 job sites already, gaining on-the-job experience that sets him up for a future career. Once he is done with the program in July 2026, Cusato plans to put his metal origami skills to use. What I've learned here in my four years is that I can take any shape of any item and make it out of metal, Cusato said. I could make it high quality...something that would be worth selling and I think that's such a cool thing. Carlson says the students in the program gain not only the skillset to start a career in the metal industry during their four years, but also learn valuable soft skills. It's the same as every other industry, Carlson said. Being punctual, honest and willing to learn are soft skills that everyone says are in high demand everywhere. Those who work on the float each year get the chance to showcase the skills they've worked hard to master. Carlson says his favorite part is getting to meet the students' families— who come to check out the float their loved ones crafted after the parade each year. I get to know more about them outside of being a student, Carlson said. Inside the shop Thursday, Saturday's float was nearly complete — only awaiting final touches. Once the festivities downtown slowed on Saturday, many gathered back at the shop to enjoy a late lunch. Everyone was all smiles and laughter echoed throughout the building. While many of those back at the shop were current apprentices and instructors, a few who finished their four years half a decade ago made an appearance. Sign Up for free: Peak Interest Your weekly local update on arts, entertainment, and life in Colorado Springs! Delivered every Thursday to your inbox. Featured Local Savings Armando Hernandez was an apprentice from 2014 to 2019 and spent a few of those years helping design the floats. The four-leaf clover in Saturday's float was actually built by him and his class in 2016. It was a project that everyone collaborated on, Hernandez said. It's fun to build things like this that you want to build. Nowadays, Hernandez works at ACCO Engineered Systems as a project manager. Colorado Sheet Metal and the company Hernandez works at are both in the Local 9 union. As a way of giving back, Hernandez now helps many of the apprentices find jobs here and there as his company needs labor and manpower throughout the year. Around December, we have a Telluride job that's four seasons and a $90 million mechanical job, Hernandez said. We're going to need a ton of manpower, so we work with the union to bring these guys in. Another student, Alex Winters, is now in his third year in the program and has worked extensively on the floats in previous years and finds a lot of joy in doing so. Putting it together and then being able to show it to the community is (really cool,) Winters said. All these pieces come together and it's cool to see how it started and how it ended up. After Winters finishes the program, he says he's excited to use the skills he learned throughout his apprenticeship but hopes to come back and teach someday. I plan on staying here doing what they like to call grunt work, Winters said. But eventually I would like to get into a position teaching people what I've learned and the things you can do with it. The parade itself drew a large crowd of people decorated in orange, white and green. A high school band from Oklahoma traveled all the way to Olympic City to perform in the parade as well. The streets of downtown were packed and traffic was backed up for blocks ahead of step off. Traditional Irish music rung through the city and adults and children alike donned beaded necklaces. Toward the end of the lineup, light flurries began to fall on parade attendees. After several days of unseasonably warm temperatures, Saturday dropped down to below average for March in Colorado, according to KOAA meteorologist Casey Dorn. Other festivities Saturday included a 5k, Leprechaun Fun Run for the kids and a Locate the Leprechaun scavenger hunt — all of which brought thousands out on a chilly Saturday to celebrate the luck of the Irish.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/life/96-years-strong-apprentices-keep-st-patrick-s-day-float-tradition-rolling/article_442192c8-01ba-11f0-86b2-df07a636ce1b.html
NEW DELHI: The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) has issued a statement in connection with the train hijack incident, claiming responsibility for executing 214 hostages, alleging that Pakistan's refusal to negotiate led to their deaths. The BLA said the Pakistani forces ignored a 48-hour ultimatum for a prisoner exchange, resulting in the mass execution of only Pakistan security forces personnel. This is in sharp contrast to claims by the Pak army which claimed on Friday that 26 hostages were killed by the Baloch rebels who ambushed a train in Balochistan. The army acknowledged that only 18 of the slain hostages were army and paramilitary soldiers. However, this comes as no surprise, sources said, as ISI has been known to hide casualties on its side. In their statement, the BLA also acknowledged the death of 12 of its Mujahideen including five Fidayeen of the Majeed Brigade aka the suicide squad in the incident which it named as Operation Darra-e-Bolan . The Baloch rebels accused the Pakistani military of attempting to misrepresent the situation and give details of its operation. When the Zarar Company of Pakistani SSG commandos arrived to rescue the hostages locked in the bogies of the Jaffar Express, Fidayeen surrounded and attacked them fiercely. In this battle which lasted for several hours SSG commandos suffered heavy casualties while the hostages were also executed, the BLA said.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bla-claims-mass-execution-of-214-pakistan-train-hijack-hostages/articleshow/119060439.cms

u2f_webusb_firefox The WebUSB standard is certainly controversial. Many consider it a security risk, and, to date, only Chromium-based browsers support it. But there is a workaround that is, ironically, supposed to increase security. The adjacent Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) standard also adds (limited) USB support to browsers. Sure, this is meant solely to support U2F USB dongles for two-factor authentication purposes, but as [ArcaneNibble] demonstrates using U2F-compatible firmware on a Raspberry Pi RP2040, by hijacking the U2F payload, this API can be used to provide WebUSB-like functionality. The provided demo involves flashing an RP2040 (e.g., Pico board) with the firmware and loading the page from localhost or a similar secure context. After this, the buttons on the browser page can be used to toggle an LED on the Pico board on or off. You can also read an input back from the RP2040. This feat is made possible by the opaque nature of the U2F key handle, which means that anything can be put in this blob. This makes it a snap to pass data from the U2F dongle to the host. For the inverse, things get a bit trickier. Here the ECDSA signature is manipulated inside the ASN.1 that is returned to the dongle. Since Firefox performs no signature validation (and Chrome only does a range check), this works. The MCU also auto-confirms user presence by having the key handle start with , so the device works without user interaction. However, you do seem to get an annoying popup that immediately goes away. Of course, this only works if you create a special USB device for this purpose. That means your normal USB devices are still secure. While we know it could be a security risk, you can do some cool things with WebUSB. We've seen a few projects that use it. RP2040-based Pico board acting as U2F dongle with Firefox.

Israelis under the age of 21 whose military service ended prematurely due to medical reasons while in combat can now apply for firearm licenses, the Knesset Spokesperson announced earlier this week. This amendment to the Firearms Law, proposed by MK Yitzhak Kreuzer of Otzma Yehudit, was approved in second and third readings, with 14 other MKs supporting and no opposition. The Firearms Law bars anyone under the age of 21 from receiving licenses or authorization to own firearms, but this new proposal will allow any combat soldier over 18 to own a weapon even if they did not complete their military service due to medical reasons. Additionally, anyone requesting a license must include their medical documents that led to the termination of their service as a way of distinguishing those deemed unfit due to mental health reasons. 'A significant amendment' Today, we made an important and significant amendment, Kreuzer said. Israelis practice shooting handguns at a local shooting range in the northern town of Katsrin, Golan Heights, on April 3, 2022, following the recent wave of terror attacks in Israel. (credit: MICHAEL GILADI/FLASH90) This bill is a message to our fighters: you are not alone. This is not just a technical law; it is a law that strengthens the connection between the state and its fighters.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office is investigating the shooting death of 34-year-old Jason Boek of Buchanan Drive in Winter Haven, that occurred around 2:20 a.m. on Tuesday, August 28, 2018, on Dundee Road in unincorporated Polk County. Preliminary information so far, based on interviews, video, audio, and physical evidence, is as follows: Late Monday evening/early Tuesday morning, an adult female called for an Uber to drive her home from the Grove Lounge located on US Hwy 27 in Dundee, because she had been drinking. Another woman at the lounge walked the patron out to the Uber when it arrived. The women do not know each other. The Uber, a Hyundai Elantra being driven by 38-year-old Robert Westlake of Lake Wales, picked the passenger up and headed westbound on Dundee Road. The woman who assisted the Uber passenger then began receiving text messages from her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Boek, that indicated he thought she got into the Hyundai; Boek told her he was going to pursue the Uber and then beat up the man driving. It appears Boek saw his girlfriend walk out to the Hyundai, and thought she – not the other bar patron – was inside. Meanwhile, just east of Carl Floyd Road, a Ford F-250 truck aggressively approached the Hyundai from behind, and then abruptly passed and pulled in front of it. Westlake told deputies that he believed the driver of the truck (later identified as Boek) was trying to run him off the road. The truck then stopped on the roadway in front of the Hyundai. Westlake stopped his car. Boek got out and walked towards the Hyundai, yelling at Westlake and claiming that he had a pistol (as heard in the attached dash cam video from the Uber). Boek continued to approach, at which time Westlake, who is a concealed weapon permit holder and a licensed armed security guard, reached into the pocket of the driver door and retrieved a handgun, firing one shot at the truck driver. After Boek was shot, Westlake called 9-1-1 and began lifesaving measures. Please click here for 911 call. He continues to cooperate with law enforcement in this investigation. He does not know Boek, and the Uber passenger does not know him either. Boek's criminal history includes previous arrests for aggravated battery, battery, burglary, marijuana possession, forgery, larceny, resisting arrest, and VOP. He's on felony probation for battery, which began in June 2016 and was scheduled to end in June 2021. His driver's license was suspended in May 2018, and the truck he was driving does not belong to him – he borrowed it from a friend. Deputies obtained a search warrant for the truck Boek was driving and recovered a marijuana cigarette and a glass pipe containing meth residue. The investigation is ongoing.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - A Warrensburg man could spend the rest of his life behind bars after he allegedly admitted to investigators that he committed a child sex crime. Johnson County, Missouri, Circuit Court records filed on Thursday, March 13, indicate that Jacob D. McKinney, 22, of Warrensburg, has been charged with a child sex crime. A probable cause statement filed by the Johnson County Sheriff's Office revealed that on Dec. 4, a report of a possible statutory rape was made to investigators. The incident allegedly happened in rural Centerview on Nov. 24. The victim, who was under the age of 14 at the time, told law enforcement officials that McKinney and another individual had picked her and a friend up in his truck. They drove out to the country, where the other two witnesses got out and sat nearby. Investigators noted that at that time, McKinney allegedly had had sexual contact with the victim. During an interview after his arrest, McKinney told them he knew it was wrong but did not think he would get in trouble. Court records indicated that McKinney was taken into custody on Wednesday and charged with a single count of statutory rape. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison. As of Saturday, March 15, McKinney remains behind bars with no bond listed. A bond reduction hearing has been scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday, March 19, no further information has been released.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/warrensburg-man-admits-investigators-he-may-have-executed-child-sex-crime/
It's May 5, the first Thursday in May, which means that it's World Password Day. The day was created by security researcher Mark Burnett to raise awareness of the importance of having secure passwords. Well, how secure are your passwords? There are a lot of hints and tips and tricks out there for creating and maintaining secure passwords. I'm pretty comfortable with tech and keeping my accounts secure, but I find most of these tips too complicated to follow. It's better to keep things simple. And I'm going to simplify things for you. This is the 21st century, and people don't need to create and remember their passwords. My advice is simple -- use a password manager. What is a password manager? A password manager is an app, usually tied to an online service, that safely and securely stores your passwords. It's also used to securely distributes these passwords to all your devices, no matter whether you are on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. Good password managers not only store your passwords and securely transfer them to your browser or apps as needed, but they can also help you generate strong passwords, and even search the internet for any of your passwords that might be leaked on the internet. Some password managers also allow you to secure your passwords with high-security features such as hardware authentication, making it almost impossible for hackers to get access to your data and informing you if you try to use duplicate passwords. So, what are the best password managers? My ZDNet colleague Ed Bott has a list of the best password managers, and it's a good list. Of the services there, Bitwarden, 1Password, and LastPass are my top choices. They're fully featured, offer solid security, and encompass a broad range of platforms and operating systems. If you're looking for a no-cost solution, the Bitwarden offers a free option, and even the paid option ($10 per year for a single user, $40 annually for a family of up to six users) is great. But you might already have a password manager and not know about it. For example, if you use a Mac or iPhone, or iPad, then you can use Apple's Keychain password manager. The only downside here is that you have to be on an Apple device to access your passwords, but it's a superb solution for those in the Apple ecosystem. If you use Google Chrome, then there's a password manager built right into that. The downside here is that it's quite basic, and you can only access your passwords from the browser. Both these are great options. But they have their limitations. So, my advice for World Password Day is that you make sure to use a password manager, not only to store your passwords but also to generate secure passwords when needed. And secure your password manager with a good, unique password. Also, a bonus tip -- if your password manager tells you that you're using duplicate passwords on different websites, or that one of your passwords has been leaked in a company data breach, then pay attention to this and take the actions that your password manager recommends, because using duplicate passwords or passwords that have leaked into the wild is a surefire way to get your online accounts compromised.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/its-world-password-day-heres-the-one-simple-tip-you-need-to-keep-your-accounts-secure-online/

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

- Advertisement - On World Polio Day (October 24), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) is celebrating the 30th anniversary of the certification of the eradication of wild poliovirus transmission in the Region of the Americas. In 1975, the region reported nearly 6,000 cases of polio. However, thanks to child vaccination and sustained surveillance implemented by governments with the support of PAHO and partners, the last case of wild poliovirus was detected in September 1991 in Peru. In 1994, the region was certified as free of this disease. Achieving a milestone like this is not easy. It involves a lot of work, commitment, and tenacity from thousands of health workers, researchers, partners, and all the people responsible for vaccinating their children, PAHO Director Jarbas Barbosa said. However, Dr Barbosa warned about the persistence of poliovirus in other parts of the world. Until we eradicate the poliovirus globally, we must maintain high vaccination coverage and adequate surveillance to detect any imported cases, he emphasized. Polio is a highly contagious disease that affects the central nervous system, causing acute flaccid paralysis. Although most infections are asymptomatic, in 1 in 200 cases, the virus can cause permanent paralysis in the legs or arms. Globally, polio cases have declined by more than 99% since 1988, when an estimated 350,000 cases were reported in more than 125 endemic countries. There are now just two endemic countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, the poliovirus does not respect borders and can find groups of unvaccinated or under-immunized children, which could lead to outbreaks. Dr Barbosa highlighted the impact of immunization programs in controlling and eliminating vaccine-preventable diseases and emphasized the continued support of governments and partners, such as Rotary International and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Despite the progress, the PAHO Director mentioned that misinformation and distrust, along with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to affect vaccination coverage in some areas and populations in the region. In 2023, 87% of children in the Americas had received the third dose of the polio vaccine necessary for full immunization, a recovery from 83% in 2022, but still below the recommended coverage rate. To prevent the reintroduction of the virus, it is essential to continue working to achieve sustained coverage of more than 95% uniformly in each country, Dr. Barbosa remarked. As the world moves towards the total eradication of wild polio, efforts are also increasingly focused on mitigating the risk of vaccine-derived cases. On rare occasions, in under-immunized populations, the live attenuated virus originally contained in the oral polio vaccine can mutate and become a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus. This virus, as it replicates in the gastrointestinal tract, can spread through feces and sewage, circulating in the environment and exposing unvaccinated individuals, who are susceptible to contracting polio. The PAHO Director called on all community leaders, health workers, and educators, among others, to join in the effort to eradicate polio and other preventable diseases. Let us unite today to celebrate 30 more years free of wild polio in the Americas and reaffirm our commitment to a polio-free world, he concluded. World Polio Day is an annual celebration that recognizes global efforts to move towards a polio-free world. To mark the day and celebrate the milestone of 30 years of the Americas certified as wild polio-free, PAHO will hold a webinar on October 24 at 10 a.m. Washington, DC time.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/paho-celebrates-30-years-without-wild-polio-in-the-americas/
Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Wes Streeting suggested hundreds more quangos could be in the firing line after the Prime Minister announced the end of the body overseeing the health service in England. He said: The abolition of NHS England – the world's largest quango – is the beginning, not the end. Patients and staff alike can see the inefficiency and waste in the health service. My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy. NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it was established to cut down on political interference in the NHS – something Mr Streeting described as an act of backside-covering to avoid blame for failures. Sir Keir Starmer delivers a speech announcing the abolition of NHS England / Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visit to Yorkshire / Sir Keir Starmer announced the abolition of NHS England in a surprise move on Thursday (Oli Scarff/PA) But on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the Government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid duplication . In his Sunday Telegraph article, Mr Streeting suggested more was to come, saying new NHS England chair Penny Dash had identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration . The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Mr Streeting, who in January of this year said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS. He told the Health Service Journal he could spend a hell of a lot of time on reorganisation and not make a single difference to the patient interest , saying instead he would focus on trying to eliminate waste and duplication . But in the Sunday Telegraph, he said he had heard former Conservative health ministers bemoan not abolishing NHS England, adding: If we hadn't acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn't have been possible. The Government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline services. But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.|2025-03-16|https://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/national/25011411.quangos-firing-line-nhs-england-scrapped---streeting/
Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. It was a very rough deal last night, he said Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night. Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Featured Local Savings Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. The amount of damage was catastrophic, Dillon said. It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over -- everything was destroyed. Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. Homes and everything were destroyed all around it, she said. Schools and buildings are just completely gone. Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral. Tad Peters and his dad, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists flee the interstate to park. Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it's here. It's here, Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn ... His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us.

100-105 mm All-Mountain Skis Taming the whole mountain isn't for everyone, but it is clearly for you. These sticks are built to charge, to power through crud and show no mercy. They'll dance in low tide in the deeper end when the snow stacks up. Built to roam on- and off-piste, the 100-105mm underfoot skis listed below don't quit. Even on your solo ski days, you can rely on them for good company. 1. Blizzard Rustler 10 Lengths 162, 168, 174, 180, 186, 192 cm DIM 134-102-123 mm Radius 17.5 m @ 180 cm To completely redesign the Rustler and Sheeva models, introduce a new shape, construction, and profile, and usher in a new freeride collection, Blizzard turned to its athletes. Even if they charge harder than the rest of us, Caite Zeliff, Marcus Caston and Connery Lundin know the difference between a good ski and a great ski. The Blizzard Rustler 10, says Lundin, is a great one. The original Rustler 10 launched in 2016 and quickly gained a following as one of the best all-mountain skis on the market. The Rustler 10 is a different ski, but the favorable traits of the old ski have carried forward and improved in a few departments, like predictability and consistent flex, says Lundin. It feels more balanced and hasn't lost that chargey, all-mountain feeling. It's even more chargey now. Lundin says the redesigned ski required some fine-tuning—some three to four rounds of prototypes over a year and a half, one of the company's longest testing processes in a decade.

Völkl Revolt 104 Lengths 172, 180, 188 cm DIM 132-104-122 mm Radius 17 m @ 172 cm Völkl's Revolt 104 lands near the top of this category for its hard-charging and versatile capabilities. A true twin tip design with full wood core throughout, the Revolt 104 feels just as home popping off in the park as it does ripping through bumps and crud all over the mountain. A triple radius sidecut allows this ski to lay out long arcs where there's room but effortlessly pivots when needed. A 104-mm waist width provides enough float when there's fresh snow to leave your mark, but a touch of camber underfoot allows for the ski to really grip it and rip it on groomers. The most fun you can possibly have on a ski, tester Kaz Sosnowski professes. Super playful, and you can lay it down when you want to. I'd bring this ski back to my mom's for dinner. 3. Salomon Stance 102 Lengths 176, 183, 190 cm DIM 132-102-120 mm Radius 23 m @ 183 cm The new Salomon Stance 102 not only looks like a good time with hot pink bases, but it also slices through groomers like a freshly sharpened knife through room-temperature, pasture-raised butter. A directional shape paired with a new poplar and karuba wood core and two Titanal plates running the length of the plank account for its vice-like grip on groomers but can also be credited for its minimized torsional rigidity, which means the new Stance 102 is more poppy and playful than its predecessor. Tester Cole Timm agrees, stating, It is a bit more approachable and makes skiing bumps and crud just a bit more fun. The flex pattern is very consistent, and the shovel is there to support you on groomers, hardback and bumps. Devan O'Connor backs up that sentiment, expressing that the Stance 102 is super fast, playful and King of the variable conditions. 4. Peak Skis 104 by Dav Lengths 160, 168, 178, 184 cm DIM 134-104-122 mm Radius 23.5 m @ 178 cm When a brand is led by legendary Olympic alpine ski racer Bode Miller, you best believe that its skis are going to absolutely demolish every standard you have ever had about directional, carving-oriented skis. When it comes to the brand's 104 by Dav, formerly the 104 SC —which stood for side country—the attention to turning detail is not lost with the few hundred grams that are shaved off from the standard Peak Skis 104. For those who prefer a lighter ski, this is a great choice, says tester Leslie Resnick. This is a great ski for Jackson Hole, tester Phil Maslow adds. Light but strong, holds its own in all conditions and you wouldn't believe it's their side country option. An everyday driver for adventure skier Chris Davenport and professional skier Michelle Parker, the 104 by Dav from Peak Skis knows no limits on the mountain, whether you're loading up on the tram or earning those turns on the skintrack. 5. HEAD Oblivion 102 Lengths 173, 181, 189 cm DIM 135-102-125 mm Radius 22.8 m @ 181 cm If you're a fan of Cole Richardson's effortlessly graceful, artistic and progressive ski style, you'll want to set yourself up on the Canadian pro skier's signature line from Head, the Oblivion series—specifically, the Oblivion 102. With a carbon sandwich twin tip construction and perfectly centered mount, the Oblivion 102 is designed to put you in the director's chair of your ski day. A 102-mm waist width and a PET-wood core provide a steady platform should you set out for fresh tracks in the morning, chewed-up leftovers in the afternoon and every side hit in between. Certified fun AF all-mountain ripper, says tester Gunter Jones. Playful, poppy, sturdy, stable—you won't have a bad time. For those who are constantly pursuing 'better,' the chase is finally over. 6. Fischer Ranger 102 Lengths 155, 162, 169, 176, 183, 190 cm DIM 137-102-127 mm Radius 18 m @ 176 cm Fischer knew exactly what it was doing when the brand completely overhauled its Ranger line for 2023, utilizing the expertise of its athletes to hone in on every crucial detail. For 2024, the Ranger line, including the Ranger 102, remains unchanged. Available in two topsheet colors instead of a men's and women's model, the Ranger 102 transcends ski and gender categories, along with ski area boundaries. Stable enough to rip up the resort, no matter the day's conditions, the Ranger 102 isn't afraid of a ridgeline bootpack or steep skintrack thanks to its versatile design features like a sandwich sidewall construction and poplar/beech wood core. Tester Shane Dowaliby went as far as to say the Ranger 102 was one of his favorite skis of the test. It handled everything I threw at it off the tram—soft bowl shredding, blasting through the crud, poppin' between moguls and carving groomers. 7. Atomic Maverick 100 Ti Lengths 172, 180, 188 cm DIM 129.5-100-120 mm Radius 19.2 m @ 180 cm The Maverick 100 Ti is a Swiss Army knife when conditions can be unpredictable, says tester Andrew Plourde. The tip and tail are stiff enough to provide proper stability when you initiate a turn on harder snow, and the stiffness underfoot provides enough power and stability to encourage confidence when tackling more advanced terrain. What more could a front-side slayer ask for? Atomic's OMatic construction utilizes a layer of Titanal to create a balanced blend of stiffness, flex and stability all the way from the tip of the ski to the tail. A Flow Profile allows the ski to carve through chop and chunder as smoothly as it skims through fresh powder by tapering the HRZN Tech tip. Tester Zach Berman couldn't help but compare this ski to driving a sports car. 8. Atomic Bent 100 Lengths 164, 172, 180, 188 cm DIM 129.5-100-120 mm Radius 19.5 m @ 180 cm If you've never heard of Atomic's Bent Chetler family, designed by legendary freeride athlete and insanely talented creative Chris Benchetler, it's safe to say you've been living under a rock. One of the most celebrated families of skis from any brand, the Bent 100 is the middle child that offers the fun and floaty capabilities of its wider siblings while still maintaining the ability to slash and carve on a dime like its smaller sibs. Tester Eric Gerrmann is willing to go as far as to say, The Bent 100 is one of the most versatile skis out on the market today. For a skier seeking one super fun, playful ski to bring anywhere, this is it—especially for an East Coaster. HRZN Tech in the tip accounts for the Bent 100's generous float, while a light wood core and Powder Rocker provide slash- and slarve-ability and Dura Cap Sidewalls offer total control on edge. 9. Völkl Mantra 102 Lengths 170, 177, 184, 191 cm DIM 142-102-124 mm Radius 18 m @ 177 cm If you're someone who enjoys laying out every turn, dropping hip and ignoring speed limits, Völkl's Mantra 102 might be the right tool for you. Designed with skiers like Jim Ryan in mind, the Mantra 102 redefines the strength-to-weight ratio we're used to by tailoring the metal to the length of the ski—making the longer lengths beefier for taller and heavier skiers and the shorter lengths more manageable for smaller snow sliders. The brand's proprietary 3D radius sidecut gives the Mantra 102 a level of versatility not often achieved in a more aggressive, directional shape ski, and a 102-mm waist width provides a wide enough platform for deeper days. It turns, floats and carves well in all conditions and blasts through crud, tester Dan Grund notes. Like Christina Aguilera, this ski's got range. 10. Line Blade Optic 104 Lengths 171, 178, 185, 190 cm DIM 132-104-123 mm Radius 19 m @ 185 cm When FREESKIER founder Brad Fayfield deems a ski super fun and very playful, you best believe the man, the myth, the legend. The most versatile width in the Blade Optic family, the 104 serves up speed and agility on the daily thanks to the brand's Gas Pedal Metal Overdive technology. Allowing the skier to harness the power of an innovative layup of Titanal to feel enhanced edge grip, stability and control underfoot, it's hard to say anything negative about this all-mountain slayer—so we won't. The 104-mm waist combined with a generous tip and tail rocker keeps you floating on top of a fresh layer, while the directional flex provides a stiffer tail for power, stability and control at high speeds. Gas pedal to the MF metal, raves tester Jenna Mahaffie. Press play on that Metallica playlist and have a screamin' good time on the Line Blade Optic 104. 11. Elan Playmaker 101 Lengths 164, 172, 180, 188 cm DIM 132–101–122 mm Radius 18 m @ 180 cm About three years ago,when executives at Elan were trying to decide which type of new ski should be added to the Slovenian company's lineup, they leaned on the advice of people who mattered most: the retailers who were going to be tasked with having to sell them. We asked them directly what ski they thought was missing from our line, says Ben Fresco, the US Marketing and Product Director for Elan. They came back and said, 'You guys are ready to make a twin tip ski that reaches a little younger audience.' Almost immediately after that, Elan's athlete team became involved in the development, giving engineers notes on the types of characteristics they'd like to see in what would become the Playmaker 101: it needed to be playful but powerful, damp but responsive. In early 2021, prototypes were being tested throughout Europe, and by December of that year, prototypes made their way to the US. We were first able to test the skis at our Ski Week in Vail, Colorado, says Fresco. Retailers, sales reps and Glen Plake got a chance to try them there. But it wasn't until that spring at Mount Bachelor, Oregon, that the team made real progress on the ski's twin tip design. Playing on the mountain's wind lips, side hits, open slopes and in the trees, the team of athletes, including Josh Bibby, Riley Revallier and Bode Barrett, were able to expose the prototypes' strengths and weaknesses fully.

Kästle ZX100 Lengths 168, 175, 181, 189 cm DIM 134-100-121 mm Radius 18 m @ 181 cm The ZX collection from Kästle was ushered into the brand's lineup to provide freeriders of any age a do-it-all ski that can stand up to whatever the day and rider throw at them. A softer flex and more rockered profile give the ZX100 a more playful look and feel compared to Kästle's other offerings, making it incredibly versatile for variable conditions and terrain. A 100-mm waist is wide enough to float on top of a fresh inch or two, while a sturdy semi-cap sandwich construction, Hollowtech 2.0 and hard-wearing topsheet can stand up to chunder, crud, bumps and wind buff without missing a beat. For tester Michelle Cox, an ex-ski racer, the ZX100 was the fastest ski I've been on all day. This ski is a bullet train with no speed limit, adds Mike Fildander. 13. Faction Mana 2 Lengths 166, 173, 178, 183, 188 cm DIM 131-102-127 mm Radius 20 m @ 183 cm Dubbed an all-mountain twin tip by the brand, Faction's Mana 2 is designed to take you all over the mountain—from the back side to the park—sans compromise. An ultra-lightweight poplar wood core keeps the ski light and playful, ready to pop off any booter or side hit, while a carbon and rubber stomp pad underfoot absorbs vibration, keeping the ride smooth and confident, no matter the speed or conditions. This ski felt right at home in pockets of soft snow up high and performed really well in mixed mid-mountain conditions, writes tester Eric Gerrmann. The stiffer tip and tail and softer mid-section allowed for maximum versatility and fun. If you tend to ski the same setup no matter the day, terrain or snowpack, Faction's Mana 2 will get the job done and have a damn good time doing it. 14. Zag Slap 104 Lengths 176, 182, 188 cm DIM 136-104-125.2 mm Radius 19 m @ 182 cm Dare we say this ski slaps? An acronym for the French ski brand, Style libre en arrière-pays, the Slap 104 from Zag features a lightweight-yet-durable design that can take a beating but won't weigh you down. Legendary professional skier Shannon Schad described the Slap 104 as a very fun, playful ski in the tracked powder, but that's not the only place this ski shines. From buttery soft snow to steep, icy couloirs, the Slap 104 proves its worth by never skipping a beat, and the 104-mm waist puts you in the perfect position to plunder whatever is out there. Whether you're someone who frequents Jackson Hole's tram line, the trailhead parking lot or the expertly crafted terrain park, the Slap 104 will feel right at home wherever you take it. For intermediate skiers looking to progress on a plank that won't overpower you, this ski may be just what your legs are looking for. 15. Line Chronic 101 Lengths 165, 172, 179, 186 cm DIM 130-101-124 mm Radius 16.6 m @ 178 cm It's all about the Chronic, maaan. Line expanded their trademark Chronic Collection with the addition of the all-new Chronic 101. For those wanting to take advantage of all the mountain has to offer in the morning, followed by afternoon hot laps in the park, the Chronic 101 is here for all-mountain freestyle enjoyment. Tester Jeffrey Davis adds that this ski is very stable and great for charging hard. They're light and playful in the park but can cut through soft bumps and rip in shallower pow. Line incorporated some new tech in its construction, including Thick Cut Sidewalls for improved impact protection and Fatty Base and Edge to dramatically increase the durability and tuning life of the ski. Thin tip technology is also featured in the all-new Chronic 101, extending the ski core through the tips and tails while creating a fiberglass bonding area to limit edge chipping and keep delaminations from propagating to the core. Step onto the Chronic 101 for a more funner all-mountain freestyle experience. Best Big-Mountain Skis 106-109 mm Steady, sturdy and sometimes a little dirty, this category's skis will get you where you want to go. Whether you're chomping through yesterday's leftovers or floating through today's fresh fluff, you say jump and they ask 'how high?' 1. Elan Ripstick 106 Black Edition Lengths 164, 172, 180, 188 cm DIM 143-106-120 mm Radius 17 m @ 172 cm Time and time again, the Elan Ripstick 106 Black Edition finds itself near the top of the list in our coveted Buyer's Guide because, well, it's just that damn good. Utilizing the brand's proprietary amphibio technology, the Ripstick rocks a designated left and right ski to help initiate the turn as well as hold the edge once it's laid over, making it a dream carving ski. At the same time, the 106-mm waist gives this Ripstick a powder-centric personality. The addition of four carbon rods embedded in the wood core—dubbed QuadRod—accounts for the ski's ripping chargeability and the added 'Black Edition' to the name. Just take it from industry vet Shannon Schad, This is a one-quiver ski for Jackson. [Elan] nailed it on how fun it is all over the mountain, adds tester Owen Shin. Whether the day calls for a foot of fresh or it hasn't stormed in a week, the Ripstick 106 Black Edition guarantees a good day every day. 2. Salomon QST 106 Lengths 157, 165, 173, 181, 189 cm DIM 139-106-126 mm Radius 19 m @ 181 cm Another Buyer's Guide mainstay, the QST 106 from Salomon, rolls into 2024 unchanged, except for its bangin' new topsheet and base design. Although a 106-mm waist is generally wide for Ice Coasters and somewhat narrow for Best Coasters, the playful profile and full poplar wood core paired with double sidewall technology underfoot make this ski a coast-to-coast people pleaser. Cork damplifier in the tip and tail keeps chatter to a minimum, and C/FX reinforcement throughout the ski boosts confidence in all conditions. FREESKIER founder Brad Fayfield describes the QST 106 as a crazy fun ski with big open groomers at high speed. Tester Caroline Daley shared similar praise, saying it carves great, is super responsive and ultra-snappy. It's grounded enough to handle chunder but light enough to bounce around in light snow and navigate tight spots. Salomon does it again. 3. 4FRNT Devastator Lengths 172, 179, 186 cm DIM 137-108-131 mm Radius 19 m @ 179 cm Annihilate everything you thought you knew about a powder ski because 4FRNT's Devastator redefines the category. A 108-mm waist gives this ski an incredibly versatile platform to plunder a fresh storm, to days-old chop and everything in between. The brand's signature multi-radius rocker profile provides the solid edgehold you expect from a cambered ski while maintaining the agility of a rockered ski. An aspen wood core keeps the Devastator stable and ultra poppy and maintains a comfortable swing weight no matter what you throw in the air. Truly the best of all worlds. Don't believe us? Just take it from tester John Weir who says, It's arguably the best reverse camber ski on the market. Slashy, quick, fun and stable. It tracks amazingly well in a wide variety of snow and provides more float than a 108-mm ski has a right to. Stiffness underfoot provides plenty of power to carve up the hard pack, but this thing excels in chop and playful snow. 4. Fischer Ranger 108 Lengths 171, 178, 185, 192 cm DIM 143-109-134 mm Radius 18 m @ 185 cm Fischer completely overhauled its Ranger line last year with the help of its robust team of freeride athletes, including the late and incredibly great Kyle Smaine. For 23/24 the Ranger line remains unchanged from its improvements, and our testers couldn't be more smitten. The Rangers ski skinnier than they are and felt super easy to get on edge, says tester Jenna Mahaffie. Really stable at speed, solid transition to hardpack, these skis made me feel fast, confident and extraordinarily good-looking. The 109-mm waist is plenty wide for most days out west, and the strategically placed Titanal covers the binding area and extends just slightly toward the tip and tail for stability at speed while maintaining a more playful feel than its skinnier siblings. For the adventurous freeriders looking for a ski that never compromises, you may have found your soul ski in the Ranger 108. 5. K2 Mindbender 106C Lengths 169, 176, 183, 189 cm DIM 138-106-127 mm Radius 18.9 m @ 183 cm We've come to know and love the Mindbender series from K2 for its mind-altering design features. For 2024, K2 introduces the Mindbender C to the collection with a few key refinements from its Ti iterations. Lighter and more playful than the 108Ti, the Mindbender 106C redefines all-mountain performance and inspires riders to push their skiing to a whole new level. Featuring the brand's proprietary Spectral Braid technology for a lively and responsive feel underfoot without losing any stability at speed, the 106C feels at home in just about any condition. Looking for one ski that can do it all? The search may just be over. Playful all-mountain fun machine. The subtle rocker lines give you plenty of float without giving up precision on harder snow, and a round even flex provides plenty of suspension and gives you a big sweet spot, raves tester John Weir. A fun daily driver, adds Owen Shin. 6. Rossignol Sender 106Ti Lengths 180, 187, 194 cm DIM 138-106-128 mm Radius 21 m @ 187 cm For the ex-ski racers who still love living out their glory days on frontside groomers, Rossignol's Sender 106Ti might be the ski for you. A directional tail and a full sheet of Titanal give the Sender 106Ti the torsional stability and beefy personality to charge full-steam ahead, no matter what's underneath you, while a versatile 106-mm waist keeps you on top of a new inch or two. If you like big terrain, going fast and don't mind hard work, this could be a great option, says tester Pat Crawford. While we wouldn't recommend skiing switch on these bad boys, the Sender 106Ti is a guaranteed good time if you've got the leg strength to throw 'em and hold 'em on just about any terrain you can encounter at the resort. 7. Dynastar M-Free 108 Lengths 172, 182, 192 cm DIM 138-108-128 mm Radius 16 m @ 172 cm A returning veteran to our coveted Buyer's Guide, Dynastar's M-Free 108 remains unchanged for another year, to no one's complaint. Labeled a 'progressive freeride ski' by the brand, the M-Free 108 is designed to put the user back in the driver's seat with the freedom to frolic, flip and fly all over the mountain, in bounds or out in the backcountry. Dynastar's Hybrid Core technology combines poplar wood with polyurethane for a supple feel and incomparable dampening. There's a reason this ski is becoming a common contender on the Freeride World Qualifying circuit—it can charge as easily as it can play. There's a reason half the kids at Alta are on this ski, and I'm pretty sure it's not because they're all flow athletes, tester Dan Grund writes. It's perfect for a lot of varied conditions. 8. Faction Dancer 3 Lengths 172, 178, 183, 188 cm DIM 134-106-124 mm Radius 21 m @ 183 cm If there's one thing for certain about Faction's Dancer 3, it's that it was made to shimmy and sashay all over the mountain. A lightweight poplar wood core gives the ski a penchant to want to pop and play off every jump, cliff and side hit while two layers of Titanal beef this baby up to stomp and charge through all conditions at mach speed. The secret sauce? An elliptical sidecut that allows for both long laid out arcs as well as short and fast pivoting. Add those details to a 106-mm waist, and you've got one of the most versatile sticks in the game. Fun, versatile and stable ski, raves tester Pat Crawford. It rails on firmer snow but was able to pivot in tight trees. It's on the stiffer side, with two sheets of metal, but very skiable in various terrain. The Dancer 3 is for freeriders who know how to funk. 9. Scott Pure Pro 109 Lengths 172, 182, 190 cm DIM 142-109-128 mm Radius 19 m @ 172 cm This ski is definitely for the aggressive and confident skier who loves to go fast and ski steep and deep, tester Christian Johansen nails the Scott Pure Pro 109 on the head. Made by and for Jérémie Heitz, the Scott Pure Pro 109 is designed to withstand all the conditions you can run into on a big freeride mission—from steep and deep to spicy and firm and everything in between. While the new construction lightens the ski up, a progressive Titanal layer encourages a consistent and responsive performance, and a wood core guarantees a smooth and easy ride. Just take it from the king of chaos, tester Ian Doherty, who says great ski, plenty of float and playfulness in the Jackson side country and held up very well at high speeds on variable traverses. 10. Kastle ZX108 Lengths 169, 179, 184, 191 cm DIM 141-108-130 mm Radius 19.2 m @ 184 cm The young folks are changing the game. The next generation of rippers inspired Kästle to build the freeride-oriented ZX line—a universal pow-slayer for freeriders of all ages. The ZX108 leaves nothing on the table in terms of soft snow performance and floatation but will conquer any terrain thrown its way. This ski will make playful moves in any terrain, allowing you to get creative with your turn shapes and smear it out when the duty calls. ZX's poplar-beech wood core is wrapped with multi-axial fiberglass in a semi-cap construction to provide a smooth and predictable flex—no metal or carbon necessary. ZX108 also includes Kästle's signature Hollowtech 2.0, a clear cutout tip that shaves weight for better mobility. As tester Drew Ingardia noted, the Kästle ZX108 is stable at high speeds but can smear a turn like a soft ski. Share Tweet Pin|2025-03-16|https://freeskier.com/stories/best-big-mountain-skis

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — Meghan Andersen scored 12 of her 27 points in a dominant second quarter and Sydni Scott scored 18 on 6-for-6 shooting from 3-point range as Fairfield cruised to a 76-53 victory over Quinnipiac in the championship game of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Tournament on Saturday, earning the Stags their sixth trip to the NCAA Tournament. It was the second straight tournament title for Fairfield (28-4). The Stags have made three of their six trips to the NCAA Tournament in the last four years. No. 2 seed Quinnipiac (28-4) handed Fairfield its only loss since Dec. 15 with a victory in the regular-season finale. The Bobcats had a 12-game win streak end. After a 15-all tie in the first quarter, Andersen took over. She made 4 of 6 shots with three 3-pointers and added her only free throw to help Fairfield outscore the Bobcats 26-11 for a 41-26 advantage at halftime. Kaety L'Amoreaux had the first two baskets of the quarter Andersen followed with a 3-pointer and a three-point play and the Stags' lead was never threatened from there. Gal Raviv scored eight for Quinnipiac on 3-for-9 shooting while her teammates made 1 of 4 shots in the second period.

Usually we know the origin of things that are used daily and have been around for nearly 50 years...especially if they originated in our own state. Well, I was today years old (nearly 30) when I found out that paintball was invented in New Hampshire. Inventions from New Hampshire, and New England: Some of the most used items ever have come from New Hampshire and New England. For snowboarders and skiers, that snowcat that grooms the mountain every day and night all winter... yeah, that brilliant idea came from a New Hampshire skier. And so did paintball. Where and when was paintball invented in New Hampshire? According to an Action Packed Paintball article, paintball has been around for 50 years. The original intent in the 1960s was for loggers and cattlemen to use the paintball guns. Loggers would use the paint to identify trees to be cut - cattlemen would ride horses and mark cattle. So the shooting at people was never part of the plan...and then New Hampshire happened. Only in New Hampshire would we think shooting painful balls of paint at each other would be a good time...but it really is! Bob Gurnsey, Hayes Noel, and Charles Gaines were three friends who talked the idea out over beers. They wanted to have a survival game in the woods - one that felt real. Years later, after talking through rules and logistics, Bob Gurnsey hosted the first game of paintball in 1981 throughout125 acres of woods in New Hampshire. The concept was a mix of capture the flag and...war! And the birth of paintball began. Shoutout to three friends having beers and creating one of the most fun games we still play today!

NOI - A group calling itself the Civil Society Coalition for Security Sector Reform staged a protest against the deliberation of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) Bill (RUU TNI), which took place at Hotel Fairmont, Jakarta, on Saturday, March 15, 2025. The protesters entered the meeting room where the closed-door session was being held to voice their opposition. According to gathered reports, three individuals entered the room through a side door at approximately 5:49 PM WIB. They protested against the TNI Bill, criticizing its discussion being held behind closed doors in a luxury hotel. Reject the TNI Bill! This is being conducted in secrecy, ladies and gentlemen, one coalition member declared inside the meeting room. The coalition opposed the bill, arguing that the process lacked transparency and contained provisions that could potentially revive the dual-function (dwifungsi) role of the military in civilian affairs. Shortly after their entry, security personnel intervened to remove the protesters. Reject military dual-function! chanted the demonstrators as they were escorted out.***|2025-03-16|https://noi.pikiran-rakyat.com/news/pr-4049159359/civil-society-coalition-protests-closed-door-deliberation-of-tni-bill-reject-military-dual-function
Newer fans of The X-Filesmay not know that the hit series was supposed to end much earlier than it did. Created by Chris Carter, The X-Files premiered on Fox in 1993 and ran for nine seasons, concluding in 2002 before it was revived for two additional seasons in 2016 and 2018 (with two movies tucked in there for good measure). The widely acclaimed crime series stars David Duchovny as Fox Mulder and Gillian Anderson as Dana Scully, a pair of FBI special agents who investigate paranormal and extraterrestrial occurrences. Achieving massive success and popularity over the years, The X-Files won 16 Emmy Awards through its run, but its total run was supposed to be much shorter as the show's final four seasons were never meant to happen. Videos by ComicBook.com The X-Files Season 5 finale titled, The End, was originally planned to conclude the series. The episode aired in 1998 and centers on an assassin's failed attempt to murder a child prodigy at an international chess tournament held in Canada. Mulder and Scully later realize that this young chess player's remarkable mind holds the key to all of the mysteries in the X-Files. However, things go south when the assassin is murdered in a jail cell and the child is captured and handed over to the Syndicate's Well-Manicured Man. The disastrous turn of events prompts the Justice Department's motion to shut down the X-Files. Instead, the Cigarette Smoking Man orchestrates a giant fire that destroys Mulder's office, and the X-Files with it. The note of finality in the episode's ending made it a fitting conclusion to The X-Files while leaving the door open for more. [RELATED – One Episode of The X-Files Was So Terrifying That They Pulled It From TV] Why Didn't The X-Files End After Season 5? Fox's initial strategy following the end of The X-Files Season 5 involved transitioning the series into a movie franchise. However, green-lighting additional seasons was deemed more appropriate given the enormous cult following of The X-Files, as well as the show's profitability for the network. At the time, two more seasons were ordered, which later resulted in a total of four successive seasons after Season 5. What came immediately after Season 5 was The X-Files movie, sticking to that initial plan and taking place between Seasons 5 and 6. The film was released in 1998, one month after The End aired. Later the same year, The X-Files Season 6 premiered its first episode, fittingly titled, The Beginning. The feature film and Season 6 focus on Mulder and Scully's work to restore the burned X-Files as they take on new cases. Many fans have questioned Fox's decision to extend The X-Files beyond Season 5, as the show's ensuing runs failed to reach the same level of critical acclaim. The originally intended ending of the Season 5 finale provided a natural conclusion to The X-Files' overarching storyline, and continuing the narrative for the sake of profit and to please fans arguably worked to the detriment of the show's legacy. Even so, the greatness of The X-Files' early days proves that the series will always have a place in TV history. The X-Files Remains a Legendary TV Show Despite its Drop in Quality After Season 5 The X-Files being so popular and lucrative that it warranted more than five seasons proves that the Fox series ranks among the most successful TV shows in history. The series' first five seasons boasted gripping mysteries and palpable tension, making it effortlessly addicting. Wildly entertaining and hard to put down, The X-Files also featured fascinating character dynamics between the main duo and their associates, as well as tons of intriguing cases at the heart of each episode. These factors cement The X-Files among the all-time greats in the science fiction genre and close to TV's legends like Breaking Bad, The Wire, and Game of Thrones. Even though Fox's move to stretch The X-Files past its five planned seasons didn't fully pay off, fans still got to see the beloved pairing of Duchovny's Mulder and Anderson's Scully on screen for longer than they were supposed to, which is a win as good as any. All episodes of The X-Files are available to stream on Hulu.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-x-files-supposed-to-end-season-5-finale-reasons-why-it-didnt/
Yakima County Sheriff Bob Udell and police chiefs from around the Yakima Valley are calling for Yakima County Coroner Jim Curtice to step down. In a joint statement, the police chiefs of Union Gap, Selah, Yakima, Moxee, Toppenish, Wapato, Zillah, Grandview, Sunnyside and Zillah, as well as Udell, said Curtice needs to do the honorable thing and resign from his position immediately. Curtice has been on a self-imposed paid administrative leave since September, when he admitted to Yakima police that he falsely accused his chief deputy of trying to poison him to cover up that he was snorting drugs he found on dead bodies, according to a complaint filed by prosecutors in district court. Bill Pickett, Curtice's attorney, said it was absolutely shocking that the police chiefs would demand Curtice resign when he was granted a leave under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act that went into effect Jan. 6 and ends March 28. Pickett refused to state what grounds Curtice was granted the leave, saying he was not allowed to share that information. If they are demanding that someone resign while they are on leave, by God they should find out if he is on a federally protected leave, Pickett said. He also said the chiefs appear to be trying Curtice in the press rather than leave it to the courts to determine if he is guilty. Curtice is charged in Yakima County District Court with making false statements to police, evidence tampering and official misconduct, and he's the target of a recall petition filed by three county Republican precinct committee officers and backed by the county GOP. While empathetic to people struggling with substance abuse, the law enforcement executives said Curtice's actions violated public trust and compromised his office and his ability to be an effective leader working with law enforcement again. Even though we are empathetic to Coroner Curtice's struggles and sincerely hope he can have a lasting recovery, some lines can't be crossed, and specific behaviors cannot be tolerated. Curtice's administrative leave is causing Chief Yakima County Deputy Coroner Marshall Slight to work excessive hours, straining the coroner's office, the statement said. Slight has been serving as acting coroner in Curtice's absence. Slight and Dr. Jeffery Reynolds, who performs autopsies on homicide victims for the county, both said they would quit if Curtice were to return to his post. Udell joined with the Yakima County Commissioners and Auditor Charles Ross in an earlier letter asking Curtice to step down. As an elected official, the only way to remove Curtice from his position is through a recall, a regular election or resignation. Curtice's drug use came to light after he overdosed in his office in August 2024 and claimed that someone spiked his workout drink powder and a tea kettle in his office with fentanyl, and said that Slight, who ran against him in 2022, had motive to kill him. Curtice checked himself into Deer Hollow, a Utah rehabilitation center that specializes in police and first responders. Curtice first went there in 2023, after he was accused of kicking a sheriff's deputy who responded to his home when Curtice was drunk and fighting with an off-duty deputy. In both cases, Curtice's wife, Kristi K. Foster, blamed post-traumatic stress disorder Curtice had as a result of childhood trauma and work as a paramedic for his behavior. In the 2023 incident, Yakima County Prosecuting Attorney Joe Brusic declined to file charges. In the current case, Brusic recused himself because Curtice discussed the overdose with him, and the Ellensburg city prosecutor is trying the case.|2025-03-16|https://www.yakimaherald.com/news/local/crime_and_courts/yakima-valley-police-chiefs-call-on-coroner-jim-curtice-to-resign/article_10cbd66c-0053-11f0-81b1-172a0ee73da3.html
Trump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later Trump invoked the 1798 Act Saturday, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2, to speed up mass deportations. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, March 3, 2025. Credit: Pool via AP WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.kens5.com/article/news/nation-world/judge-limits-trumps-deport-people-under-alien-enemies-act/507-11894e2b-e26c-4121-965a-0d38c250227e

If you have a few friends and want to try out the game online without being visible to the online community, you should use Radmin VPN to create a quick and easy 'Radmin server' to play online with your friends. Radmin also allows you to connect to public servers, however, the user experience is not as good as GameRanger. Network -- Enable this if you encounter problems connecting to other optimizations players. This can alleviate connectivity issues for all 3 online platforms. Since this option will reduce security settings in order to increase connectivity, you will be taking a risk and exposing your PC (just a little more) to the Internet. Use with caution. In short, when you enable network optimizations, your Windows will choose to prefer IPv4 over IPv6. This is useful because Generals and Zero Hour fail to connect to other players when IPv6 is used. Furthermore, your WiFi or ethernet network is set to be a 'private network', and GenPatcher also adds a firewall-entry for Generals, Zero Hour, and GameRanger. Disabling the network optimizations will only undo the changes that were applied by GenPatcher. GameRanger -- GameRanger automatically launches the game in full-screen window mode by default. However, switching to window mode can bring a number of benefits such as additional stability. Enabling this setting updates GameRanger to run your game in window when the game is launched. Hide IP from -- This may be useful for live-streamers who are game menus broadcasting their matches on live video platforms such as YouTube or Twitch.

You will be able to see which game installation type you have installed, the date of when the game was installed, as well as the version of your game. If your game installation is not supported, please find an alternative and legal way of installing the game. There are also clickable shortcut-style links to your game's installation directories (where the official game installer installed your game), and your game's 'Data' folders (where configuration files, maps and replays are held). 8. COMMAND-LINE LAUNCH PARAMETERS GenPatcher supports a number of command-line launch parameters. For a seamless experience, it's recommended to run your command-line terminal as administrator. -acceptpolicy -- Automatically accept the privacy policy without being shown the privacy policy popup. -autoclose -- Automatically close GenPatcher after a 'dump' or 'forceinstall' has completed successfully. -dump -- Generate a debug info dump as a dump.txt text file in GenPatcher's directory (Documents\Command and Conquer Generals Data\GenPatcher).

Audio from a 911 call made from the house where four University of Idaho students were murdered in 2022 has been released to the public, revealing panic and confusion as callers realize one of their friends is no longer breathing. The frantic phone call was placed by surviving roommates Dylan Mortensen and Bethany Funke at 11:55 a.m. on Nov. 13. The audio begins with a 911 dispatcher asking the caller to describe the emergency. Hi, something has happened here, one of the women sobs in the clip, which was first obtained late Friday by NBC News. Something has happened in our house, we don't know what. When asked about the address of the emergency, the caller appears to break down. A friend of the women then picks up the phone and begins to describe the situation to the dispatcher. One of the roommates who's passed out, and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up, the caller says, referring to 20-year-old Xana Kernodle. Oh, and they saw some man in their house last night. When the first caller picks up the phone again, the dispatcher asks her to find out if someone is still passed out in the off-campus house in Moscow. She responds by saying she'll go check. After a few seconds, when heavy breathing could be heard on the line, a male caller picks up the phone. Is she breathing? the dispatcher asks him, to which he replies, No. While a transcript of the 911 call was made public in court filings last week as murder suspect Bryan Kohberger prepares for trial, Friday marked the first time the public could hear the panic in the voices of the victims' friends and roommates as they struggled to comprehend the situation. Bryan Kohberger, left, who is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022, looks toward his attorney, public defender Anne Taylor, right, during a hearing in Latah County District Court, Thursday, Jan. 5, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. / Ted S. Warren/AP Bryan Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Text messages between Mortensen and Funke were also made public last week, and depict similar fear and confusion hours earlier when they noises heard in the home but none of their other roommates were answering their phones. At around 4:23 a.m., Mortensen texted Funke that she was freaking out after seeing what she thought was a man in the house wearing something resembling a ski mask. Funke then told Mortensen to run to her room so they didn't have to be alone. Roughly six hours later, the women texted their roommates to ask if they were awake. But Kernodle, along with Madison Mogen, Ethan Chapin and Kaylee Goncalves, are believed to have been stabbed to death by that time. Kohberger, who was arrested that December at his parents' home in Pennsylvania following a six-week manhunt, has pleaded not guilty to the murders. His trial is scheduled to begin in August.

Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows, Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgård, LL Cool J, Michael Rapaport, and Aida Turturro. SYNOPSIS: A team of scientists researching a cure for Alzheimer's on an isolated facility become the victims of sharks with increased intelligence, thanks to their experiments. Jaws may be the daddy of shark movies and Jaws 2 is the one that gets ripped off and copied, but 1999s Deep Blue Sea also seems to hold a special place in the hearts of monster movie fans. It could be because the last big shark movie before that was Jaws: The Revenge, a movie that has a special genre all of its own, so something new was needed, and with special effects having come a long way since the days of mechanical sharks malfunctioning and causing problems on set, the stars were aligned to bring the terrors of the deep back once again. However, that was way back in 1999, and a lot has changed again since then, as shark movies are now made seemingly every week, still ripping off the plot of Jaws 2 but with CGI effects that vary in quality from the cartoonish to 'how did they make a shark do that?'. Still, Arrow Video have seen fit to bring this landmark shark movie back in a 4K UHD package to sit alongside their other recent mainstream movie upgrades, but does it still hold up amongst the current crop? Sort of, because let's be honest, despite Deep Blue Sea boasting some excellent practical effects, the CGI always left a lot to be desired, looking a bit rubbish back in 1999 and not really improving with a 4K upgrade, although this isn't a remaster so the (slightly) improved contrasting only really highlights what was already there. The saving grace is that Deep Blue Sea was made during a time when CGI was used to enhance practical effects rather than replace them, and when the animatronic sharks are shown up close, they do look terrifyingly real. In fact, the sharks are the main stars in more ways than one because, despite having some names in the cast, the model fish display more charisma than any of the human actors. Samuel L. Jackson and LL Cool J seem to realise what kind of a movie they are in – essentially, a B-movie made on a major studio budget – and pitch their performances accordingly, but rarely in the realms of blockbuster cinema have there been two leads in one movie less charismatic than Thomas Jane and Saffron Burrows. Jane is trying to be the all-American hero as shark trainer Carter Blake, giving it his best Snake Plissken gruffness and Indiana Jones aloofness, but his bleach-blonde hair and half-witted expressions just don't gel with the dialogue he is trying to deliver and he comes across like a parody of Flash Gordon. However, his performance is almost Oscar-worthy when compared to Saffron Burrows and her dead-behind-the-eyes turn as Dr. Susan McAlester, the lead scientist and the one who has broken medical convention and artificially increased the sharks' brain mass in order that they produce more brain juice to fight Alzheimer's. In other hands that would be a meaty role, and an actor who could pitch it at the right tone would make Dr. McAlester a character you can cheer or boo, depending on what scene she is in. It is a charisma-free performance, and when she and Thomas Jane are together there is more chemistry going on in the artificial shark's artificial brains than there is on the screen. Deep Blue Sea also features Stellan Skarsgård in a role that feels like it was written for someone else who isn't as much of an onscreen presence, and Michael Rapaport doing his best to be the cool sidekick but the script doesn't allow him too much personality in case he outshines Thomas Jane, which he does. Nevertheless, in keeping with the B-movie plot, we have a cast who deliver B (and in some cases, C and D)-movie performances, along with other such contrivances that raise questions, like how do people trapped in small tunnels in waist-high water get surprised by 45-foot, 8000-pound shark sneaking up on them? We know these are the dimensions because we are told, but any other logic seems to float away to the surface once the proverbial hits the fan. But the point of a B-movie is not to question the logic and to just enjoy the spectacle, and Deep Blue Sea is enjoyable if you don't question too much about it (such as why is RoboCop/Total Recall legend Ronny Cox in one scene and does not say a word?). The sharks are terrifying and when seen swimming in the dark water outside the facility are exceptionally creepy, there is a brilliantly daft kill for one character that Steven Spielberg would never have attempted in his wildest dreams back in the 1970s and, of course, a very famous scene involving one character giving a speech – you likely know who and what happens, but if you don't, you'll just have to watch it. All of which makes Deep Blue Sea a fun, but flawed, time at the movies, so does this 4K UHD presentation warrant an upgrade if you already own it? Well, if you own it on DVD then yes, but if you upgraded to Blu-ray a few years back then you may want to hold onto your pennies, unless you really need a poster, a book containing essays and previously unseen production notes, and a set of postcards. Extras on the disc include brand new audio commentaries by screenwriter Duncan Kennedy and critic Rebekah McKendry, a brand-new interview with production designer William Sandell and a video essay by film critic Trace Thurman, all of which provide analysis with the benefit of hindsight, but there is nothing new from any of the cast or director Renny Harlin. There are a lot of archive extras ported over from previous releases, so if you want to hear Harlin and Samuel L. Jackson talking about the movie from the time then you can do so, but as far as picture quality goes, there really isn't a significant difference from the previous Blu-ray release, with one or two lit-up scenes looking a little crisper, but with none of the CGI touched up and the film grade looking a little flat – like a lot of '90s movies did, and still do – it depends how much you really need the retrospective thoughts of the production designer in your life that should guide your hand on purchasing this one.

This story is almost like something you would see in a Showtime show like Weeds. This week, a second defendant in a RV drug bust case out of North Bend was sentenced to seven years in prison. Homeland Security Nab WA Couple for Selling Black Market Fentanyl What Had Happened Was... A couple living out of an RV in Washington State was busted by King County Sheriffs for drugs, guns, and weapons possession in their RV camper. Homeland Security and the FBI later discovered the couple were also involved in selling fentanyl on the dark web. Other agencies helped to nab the suspects, including the Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Washington State Patrol, and the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). A campground shooting is what started the investigation into the Washington couple, as revealed by KOMO News. The man, Braiden F. Wilson, was shot in the campground and went to Harborview Medical Center for medical attention. When he and his partner, Chandler Bennett, returned to their RV, King County Sheriffs deputies were securing the crime scene and investigating the shooting. Wilson tried to enter his RV--against law enforcement's orders not to-- and he was eventually tased and told to leave the premises with Bennett, according to a report from Valley Record News. The pair were both later arrested after a search warrant procured several illegal and deadly items, which you will see below. The couple got busted after a raid on their RV at Washington's Olallie State Park, located near North Bend. Olallie State Park North Bend Washington State Not only was the couple arrested and charged with a host of crimes including drug trafficking and drug possession with intent to sell black market fentanyl, but they were also accused of putting facility workers and customers at risk because of the toxic contamination of their storage unit, which was discovered after another search warrant.

Seth Rogen recently shared how Sony—the very studio that produced the iconic 2007 comedy Superbad—refused to let Jonah Hill's character interact with a PlayStation console during filming. The ironic restriction came because executives deemed Hill's character too reprehensible to be associated with their gaming hardware. This peculiar creative limitation becomes even more amusing, considering Hill's character was actually based on a teenage Rogen himself, making the studio note not just a rejection of a fictional character but inadvertently an insult to one of the film's creators. The anecdote is a fascinating glimpse into the strange decisions that occur behind the scenes in major film productions. Videos by ComicBook.com Speaking with Rotten Tomatoes at the SXSW premiere of his new Apple TV+ series The Studio, Rogen shared the humorous story when asked about the funniest studio note he'd ever received. Sony made the movie and we were told that Jonah Hill's character, Seth, was so reprehensible to the studio, Rogen explained. There's a scene where they're playing video games and it was like, 'Jonah can't touch a PlayStation.' They were like, 'We can't have him interact with our products as a character, because it's too vile a character, The actor-writer continued. And I was like, 'It's based on me, that's very insulting.' The creative restriction is particularly ironic given that Superbad was distributed by Sony Pictures, making it a case of one division of the company restricting another. While many films feature product placement as a marketing strategy, this situation represents the opposite—a company actively preventing its product from being associated with a character they viewed negatively. For those unfamiliar with the film's origin story, Superbad holds a special place in Rogen's career. He co-wrote the screenplay with his childhood friend Evan Goldberg when they were just teenagers. The script drew heavily from their own high school experiences in the 1990s, with the main characters even named Seth and Evan as a direct nod to its creators. The comedy follows two awkward high school seniors attempting to lose their virginity before heading to college. Though raunchy and over-the-top at times, the film is now considered a classic coming-of-age story that balances wild comedy with genuine heart. Despite the PlayStation restriction, Rogen noted that the production accommodated Sony's request. Viewers with a keen eye might notice that while Michael Cera's character Evan does play The Getaway: Black Monday on a PlayStation 2 in an early scene, Hill's character Seth never touches the console. Superbad went on to become a massive hit despite—or perhaps partly because of—its reprehensible lead character, launching Hill into stardom with his first leading role. The film has maintained its popularity over the years, with producer Judd Apatow later revealing he had hoped for a sequel set during the characters' college years, though Hill reportedly suggested they should wait until they were 70 or 80 to revisit the roles. As for Rogen, he clearly holds no grudges about the backhanded corporate insult, sharing the story with his trademark humor as he promotes his latest project. What do you think?

Do you have a favorite folk or rock singer from the 1970s that fell off the map? Maybe you're wondering what happened to them. For most musicians, the music industry is a fickle thing, and careers come to an end almost abruptly. These 1970s folk and rock musicians, in particular, basically disappeared overnight. Let's find out what happened to them! Videos by American Songwriter 1. Bobbie Gentry You might remember Bobbie Gentry from her 1967 hit Ode To Billie Joe . After that hit, she enjoyed fame well into the 1970s and became known for her haunting, gorgeous voice. She was also quite a storyteller and charted well with songs like Fancy . Sadly, by the late 1970s, Gentry disappeared. She stopped making music, performing, and even talking to reporters. There were a ton of rumors about her whereabouts, and the dawn of the internet only made the rumors weirder. We still don't know where she is; we do know that she simply lost interest in making music and opted for a quieter, intensely private life. 2. Jim Croce This stellar example of rock musicians from the 1970s who disappeared could have easily become bigger after the 1970s. Jim Croce became quite successful in the early 1970s folk-rock world with hits like Time In A Bottle and Bad, Bad Leroy Brown . Jim Croce didn't step away from the limelight or lose his luster as a musician. The truth is much more tragic. Sadly, Jim Croce was killed in a plane crash in 1973. He was only 30 years old. One can't help but wonder how big his career would have gotten if he had survived. 3. Al Stewart Remember Al Stewart? This folk-rock icon made it big in the mid-1970s with his hit song Year Of The Cat . He was known for his excellent storytelling abilities and masterful melodies. His album of the same name was a big success, as was his follow-up record Time Passages. By the 1980s, Stewart's career tapered off. He continued to release new tunes, but his 15 minutes of fame were clearly up. That hasn't stopped him from performing regularly through the years, and he even announced a Farewell Tour in the United Kingdom for 2025. 4. Terry Jacks Terry Jacks is probably one of the most interesting rock musicians of the 1970s who disappeared without a trace. Jacks became famous in 1974 with the release of his hit song Seasons In The Sun . He could have easily followed that song up with another chart-topper. Instead, Jacks stepped away from mainstream attention. He did release a few more songs, but nothing more than that. He decided to focus on his real passion, environmentalism, instead. Jacks continued to make music here and there, but he was not a big fan of the music industry and preferred to focus on activism instead.|2025-03-16|https://americansongwriter.com/4-folk-and-rock-musicians-from-the-1970s-who-disappeared-without-a-trace/
FLORENCE, S.C. -- People and some dogs turned out en masse Friday night to celebrate a warm, early spring night with the Lucky Shamrock Festival in Downtown Florence. Sponsored by the Junior League of Florence the festival featured vendors of food and kitch, the usual beer wagon, music from the Painted Man the festival occupied the 100 block of Dargan Street.

Ukraine has created what is describes as an IT army to defend against Russian hackers and to launch counter operations against cyber threats. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by cyberattacks targeting the country's services and infrastructure, including DDoS attacks and destructive wiper malware campaigns – leading to the Ukrainian government calling for volunteers to aid with cybersecurity. But it has also asked for support in conducting offensive cyber operations back at Russia. We are creating an IT army, Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine said in a tweet at the weekend. There will be tasks for everyone. We continue to fight on the cyber front. The first task is on the channel for cyber specialists, he added, alongside a Telegram link to join the 'IT Army of Ukraine', which now has tens of thousands of subscribers. SEE: Cybersecurity: Let's get tactical (ZDNet special report) In addition to helping to protect Ukrainian critical infrastructure and services from attacks, supporters were provided with a list of websites of 31 Russian targets. They include organisations in both the state-backed and private sectors, including government agencies, banks, critical infrastructure and energy providers, including Gazprom and Lukoil, as well Russian email provider and search engine, Yandex. The list of targets is also being circulated in some underground forums. This IT army is just one of the online efforts taking place during the conflict; hacktivist collective Anonymous has said it is taking action in support of Ukraine and against Russia, while Russia-based cyber-criminal groups have also indicated that they'll take offensive action in support of Vladimir Putin's invasion. This includes the ransomware group Conti, which announced full support of Russian government and the intention to strike back at the critical infrastructure of an enemy in response to cyberattacks against Russia. A later statement by Conti claimed it doesn't support any government, but it will strike back against the West and American cyber aggression . Conti has since seen many of its internal documents leaked in what appears to be another act of retaliation. Meanwhile, the BBC has also reported how Russian hackers – without direct orders from the state – are also attempting to hack Ukrainian websites and services. According to analysis by Check Point, there's a 196% increase in cyberattacks targeting Ukraine's government and military since Russia sent troops in last week. It's likely that cyberattacks will continue in both directions, particularly as more and more people join Ukraine's cyber army. We're now witnessing a concentrated attack to take down major websites and services in Russia and other surrounding countries, much like a community-driven effort. They have to deal with waves of DDoS attacks that are likely to worsen as time goes by, says Silviu Stahie, a security analyst at Bitdefender. It's much too early to understand the impact of any of these developments. Something on the scale of Ukraine's IT army has never been tried before, so it's hard to know what kind of impact it will have, although it may play an important part simply in rallying support in broader terms. There's also the concern that civilians launching their own hacking attempts could have unexpected consequences. And the rise of offensive cyberattacks carried out by civilians raises a whole host of new questions – particularly as, in many countries, engaging in hacking is illegal. Conducting or participating in cyberattacks, even in what could be considered a noble effort to support Ukraine against the Russian aggression and invasion, could be subject to how different countries interpret hacking laws, says Jens Monrad, head of threat intelligence, EMEA, at Mandiant. Another risk associated with this operation is how well each individual can protect themselves and how Russia might perceive it if they identify a foreign person suddenly hacking Russian targets, says Monrad. SEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) There's also the risk that cyberattacks, intentionally or not, could cause disruption outside Ukraine and Russia. As UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) CEO Lindy Cameron commentedrecently: Cyberattacks do not respect geographic boundaries . International consensus also suggests the Russian military was behind the widespread and disruptive NotPetya malware attack of June 2017. The malware attack was designed to disrupt financial, energy and government sectors in Ukraine, but the malware spread to organisations around the world, costing an estimated billions of dollars in damages. As a combat veteran, I'm in total awe of the courage of the Ukrainian people. While there are no specific threats to the US, we must be prepared for spillover effects of Russian cyber ops or an uptick in ransomware, Jen Easterly, director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said on Twitter. CISA, along with the UK's NCSC, are among those cybersecurity agencies that have published advice on defending against cyber threats. In this environment, organisations around the world would be wise to examine their cybersecurity defences – because what comes next could be unpredictable.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukraine-is-building-an-it-army-of-volunteers-something-thats-never-been-tried-before/
In laboratories and lecture halls across two countries, an alarm is sounding. Academic freedom – the bedrock of scientific progress and innovation – faces parallel assaults that threaten decades of research advancement and international collaboration. The disturbing and hasty actions taken by President Donald Trump's administration against scientific institutions, programs, and researchers in the US are a cause for deep concern. They include drastic cuts to the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and other leading research bodies. Beyond defunding, the administration's activity extends to imposing ideological restrictions on research priorities and appointing highly inappropriate people to key positions. These changes will have far-reaching consequences for the international scientific ecosystem. They are poised to halt essential funding for breakthrough technologies and to sever collaborative networks developed over decades. They will also disrupt crucial multinational research initiatives that address global challenges, from confronting climate change and preparing for future pandemics to dealing with global cybersecurity, regulating AI, and ensuring the health and well-being of humans worldwide. There is no need to elaborate on the enormous contribution of American science to humanity over many decades. However, the current measures threaten not only American scientists but will directly impact all scientists, Israel's included, whose work relies on collaborative partnerships and joint funding opportunities. Research and development throughout the free world is at stake, as are the academic freedom and research independence that are fundamental prerequisites to free democratic societies. US President Donald Trump makes an announcement about an investment from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, DC, US, March 3, 2025. (credit: REUTERS/LEAH MILLIS/FILE PHOTO) Similar, but much smaller attacks on academic institutions in Israel Over the past two years, similar, albeit less vicious, attacks have been waged by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Israeli scientific and cultural institutions. These include crippling cuts in funding and attempts to weaken the independence of bodies such as the universities, the National Library, and the Planning and Budget Committee of the Council for Higher Education, which is responsible for the funding, curricula, and overall approval of all academic programs and degrees. When politicians on both sides of the Atlantic attempt to subordinate academic research to shortsighted political considerations, they damage not only academic freedom but also the national and economic resilience of their countries, and, as a frightening potential consequence, of the world at large. This is not just a crisis for academia – it is a major crisis for democracy. In light of these developments, desperate calls must go out to both governments. Our leaders here must take urgent, proactive measures to safeguard the future of Israeli science. Efforts should focus on strengthening national funding, deepening existing collaborations, and fostering new global research partnerships and international opportunities. All of these must be done while safeguarding academic freedom and the independence of Israel's academic and cultural institutions. The ability of science in Israel to thrive in an increasingly unstable global landscape depends on strong, forward-thinking policies at home. As our scientists and academic institutions confront both the challenges of wartime mobilization and crippling academic boycotts from abroad, preserving academic freedom here is vital. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter As for the US, the Trump administration must make a full about-turn. It should reconsider its recent detrimental policies and reaffirm its longtime commitment to the principles of academic freedom and scientific integrity, without which America cannot become great again. Far from it. In closing, I would like to clarify that there is no contradiction between this plea to Trump and the letter my three Nobel-winning colleagues and I sent a couple of weeks ago, offering him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize if he manages to bring about an imminent release of all Israeli hostages held by Hamas – the intention being, of course, that this be combined with an end to the war and the terrible bloodshed in Gaza. Here, I am talking about science and the great danger Trump's administration poses to it, and there we were talking about human lives and the great danger each day brings to so many of them – the hostages, as well as the numerous civilians and military personnel on both sides. These are two extremely grim issues, and Trump holds the key to resolving both.|2025-03-16|https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-846160
As policies are being made at the federal and state levels with the potential to impact their districts, local school administrators are keeping an eye on the evolving situation — and hoping for the best. Likely the largest current issue to garner the attention of school administrators is the scaling back of the Department of Education under the Trump administration. The department announced Tuesday it had plans to lay off more than 1,300 of its employees as part of an effort to halve the organization's staff. The layoffs are part of a dramatic downsizing directed by Trump as he moves to reduce the footprint of the federal government. Department officials said it would continue to deliver on its key functions such as the distribution of federal aid to schools, student loan management and oversight of Pell Grants. While parents have expressed confusion and concern over what this might mean to local school districts, administrators currently have little more information to offer. We really are not sure how the current situation with the Department of Education will affect us, Allegany-Limestone Central School District Superintendent Tony Giannicchi told the Times Herald. A majority of the federal money we receive is used towards the cost of educating special needs students and helping underserved students. It makes me a little nervous that Secretary of Education Linda McMahon did not know what IDEA was and asked for patience as she was learning the job, he continued. IDEA stands for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, a federal law ensuring a free public education for eligible children with disabilities, including special education and related services. The Department of Education is an advocate for underserved children and, hopefully, they will not be impacted by the current actions taking place, Giannicchi added. Portville Central School Superintendent Thomas Simon indicated his district had as yet not experienced any effects from the department scaleback. We have not yet felt the impact of the changes in the U.S. Department of Education. We have continued to get our grant reimbursements that flow through NYS, Simon said. Olean City School District Superintendent Dr. Genelle Morris did not respond to a request for comment. Another issue threatening to impact schools was the announcement last week that the U.S. Department of Agriculture was canceling $1 billion in local food purchasing aid to schools and food banks. The USDA was set to give $660 million to schools as part of a program instituted in 2021 by then-President Joe Biden. These funds were intended to help schools to buy food locally from nearby farmers and suppliers. If we were to lose our federal food commodities, we would likely no longer be able to provide free breakfast and lunch. Without the purchasing power of the federal government, we would need to buy food at significantly higher prices. Ultimately, parents and/or taxpayers would bear these increased costs, Simon said of the impact on Portville. Giannicchi stated Allegany-Limestone is also monitoring the situation. It is too early to tell right now, he said. We spend about $20,000 a year on fresh produce, most of it local, that we serve in lunches and this is funded from federal money. Budgets are starting to really tighten up with the decrease in aid from the state and now the federal government which will start to affect operations in schools. At the state level, Gov. Kathy Hochul has highlighted a plan for bell-to-bell distraction-free schools, with a significant part of her plan being the banning of smart phones in the classroom. In a statement supporting the governor, New York State School Counselor Association President Lysa Mullady said, I've seen firsthand how cell phone use in schools can negatively impact students' ability to focus, learn, and develop problem-solving skills. The constant distractions from devices interrupt the learning process, create a false sense of belonging, and hinder the development of sustained attention. Mullady aded the instant gratification provided by cell phones undermines the development of grit and perseverance necessary for building self-esteem and achieving academic success. A statewide bell-to-bell restriction on cell phone use is essential to ensuring that students can learn and grow in a safe, trustworthy environment. Simon and Giannicchi endorse the move, while cautious about how the state plans to enforce the policy. Gov. Hochul's ban on cell phones is an effort to help students focus on school while they are present, Giannicchi said. We currently do not have students in grades K-8 with cell phones in school. Cell phones are a big part of young people's culture so banning them in school will take some effort, he added. Hopefully, we will have some support with this new mandate to help us.|2025-03-16|https://www.oleantimesherald.com/news/cattaraugus_county/local-school-administrators-eye-changes-at-federal-state-levels/article_43cb1634-00f5-11f0-bc7a-cf18bffbb6e3.html

EJ Moreno on the essential DC films… As we prepare to enter a new era for the DC Universe with James Gunn's Superman, it feels like an ideal time to make a watchlist of the DC movies that brought us to this point. It's been a rocky road with great ups and downs, but there's nothing quite like an amazing DC movie to bring joy to longtime fans. So, we've compiled ten of the greatest DC Universe movies ever. Take a look below, and be sure to let us know your must-watch movies via our social channels @FlickeringMyth… Superman: The Movie Comic book adaptations have happened since cinema began, going as far back as the classic Batman serials. But what would soon spawn the modern era of superheroes began with 1978's Superman: The Movie. Richard Donner's seminal film changed everything and became the benchmark for quite some time. Besides its cultural impact, it is just a fantastic movie to behold. Christopher Reeve is the golden standard for the Man of Steel. His performance carries a touching weight, working seamlessly through the action, comedy, romance, and drama. Reeve would follow this performance up with a few good outings, but his earnest nature helped build this character's legacy and made him the pop culture icon we all know. Superman: The Movie is one of Warner Bros.' most successful films, an Academy Award winner, and one of the must-see superhero movies ever. Batman Over a decade after Superman became a touchstone for comic book adaptations, Tim Burton took his shot at cementing a legacy and cooked up another superhero classic with 1989's Batman. Fans were hesitant about the project, as Burton was still finding his voice as a filmmaker, and the character was coming off a period when camp took over any sense of drama. As a way of standing out, the film went full goth and gave us a moody and fun film that summed up all we'd loved about Burton and Batman for decades. Michael Keaton almost instantly found his footing in the role, even if his outfit barely let him move. Alongside a delirious Jack Nicholson as Joker, these two cooked. To show you the impact of this one movie, Batman '89 was the highest-grossing film based on a DC comic book until 2008's The Dark Knight. Batman: Mask of the Phantasm While animated DC movies deserve their own list of essential classics, you can't look at widely released DC projects and not include the brilliant Batman: Mask of the Phantasm from 1993. This film was Warner Bros. Animation's first production, released between seasons one and two of Batman: The Animated Series. You can see those growing pains in the box office and the scheduling. Despite that, it became a treasured classic by audiences and critics. There's magic in this universe that always works. After the passing of the great Kevin Conroy, this is a perfect film to revisit as a celebration of what he added to Batman's and DC's mythos. For me, this is the Batman movie. You can never go wrong with viewing Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, a throwback animated beauty from a lackluster DC era. SEE ALSO: Your Angel of Death Awaits – The Greatness of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm V for Vendetta Not all DC films have to be superhero adaptations; some can be reworkings of graphic novels that are so deeply grounded in reality that they almost feel too shocking for the mainstream. V for Vendetta is one of those stories. It takes the deeply political work found in Alan Moore's novel of the same name and holds nothing back in a stunning directorial effort from James McTeigue. With the help of The Wachowskis, this became a film that mainstream blockbuster lovers were too afraid to embrace fully. Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving turn out career-defining roles that challenge you as a viewer, giving a layered performance in an already dense story. The film is an early example of what many superhero movies would attempt: tell an action-packed political and socially conscious story. Superman Returns Finding the perfect Superman movie, or even an amazing one, is no easy task. After the iconic original from Reeve, it took years to get another entry, and this one was wild. Instead of going the reboot route as many expected (that was to come with Zack Snyder's Man of Steel), 2006's Superman Returns decided to continue the legacy of what came before it. With that, we got a nostalgic ride to the Christopher Reeve era through Brandon Routh and his perfect Boy Scout vibes. Not everything works, and it's not the most memorable film, but it works as a stepping stone from one film era to another. A transitional moment that helped bridge the gap. If you take away the film's villain and director being actual weirdos, it's a decent Superman film that gave fans what they'd never get again. The Dark Knight It's hard to express to someone who wasn't around in 2008 just how much this film had a grip on pop culture, but upon its release, there was no escaping The Dark Knight. The director changed the game forever when Christopher Nolan entered the comic book movie business. Never again could these movies be campy little movies for longtime nerds. Nolan's iconic work in The Dark Knight made every studio and filmmaker rethink what a superhero blockbuster could be, for better or worse. Everyone wants to recapture this magic, but no one could even touch Heath Ledger's groundbreaking work as The Joker, an Oscar-winning juggernaut of a role. Even if everyone wanted to go the self-serious and drama route after this, it's hard to imagine a world without The Dark Knight. SEE ALSO: The Dark Knight: Why It's Still the Best Superhero Movie Watchmen Before he became the controversial figurehead of the DC Extended Universe, Zack Snyder created an epic look at Alan Moore's masterful graphic novel Watchmen. Would it be too bold to say it's still his best? Many felt bringing Moore's Watchmen to the cinema would be impossible. It was too weird, too shocking, and had too much superhero context needed to work. Snyder took that challenge and did everything he could to make it work, and it shockingly came together quite nicely. It was like one madman filtering another's work. Although Zack Snyder may not be known for his best acting direction, his work with his actors, especially Jackie Earle Haley, is masterful. It's all so grounded, even at its most comic book. If you haven't seen this film in a while, buckle up and brace yourself for this harrowing experience. SEE ALSO: Zack Snyder's Watchmen: An ambitious adaptation of a darkly complex comic book classic Wonder Woman It's wild to think how vital Wonder Woman was to the early days of the DCEU and how it is still widely regarded as one of the top-tier movies from the previous DC Films installments. The DCEU was in a rocky spot following the wild year of 2016. Patty Jenkins needed to come in with a certified banger to swing the general public in DC's favor. She did that with Wonder Woman, which starred Gal Gadot in her best performance and was filled with heart, soul, and plenty of memorable action. Out of all the films included here, it's hard to name one with a scene as impactful as the No Man's Land scene. It hits hard with the message and still manages to stun as a set piece. Sadly, the follow-up to this wouldn't match these heights, but we can still look back at the 2017 movie that kept DC alive. Zack Snyder's Justice League From the saving grace to the final chapter, Zack Snyder's Justice League marked the end of what was once supposed to be the DC's answer to the MCU. With this movie, we saw Snyder go all or nothing. In 2017, DC dropped Justice League, a chopped version of what Zack Snyder started, but Joss Whedon took over after a tragedy. Years later, with a social media campaign known as Release The Snyder Cut, the filmmaker got his version out, and it was an all-out DC explosion. It was head-to-toe insanity. For years, we'd never thought Darkseid could face off with a fully united Justice League, but this 4-hour epic took us on a journey through so much of what Snyder had planned. While many wanted more from this universe, some fans are perfectly fine with this being the closing moment for an epic time in DC. SEE ALSO: Re-evaluating Zack Snyder's DCEU Trilogy: The Misunderstood Superman Saga Joker While the DCEU ended, an Elseworlds universe emerged where artists could tell their own versions of iconic DC stories. One of those defining films was Todd Phillips' Joker. When this film dropped, the world seemed ablaze in a billion-dollar Oscar-winning moment. Fans and pundits questioned its morals, the cinema bros had a massive talking point, and the general public craved a good DC story. It was a perfect moment that led to the film hitting heights no one expected, a true cinematic gem. Joker led Joaquin Phoenix to finally winning an Oscar, giving the Joker role an Oscar win in Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. It's genuinely unheard-of insanity. Whether you love or hate it, it's a film you must acknowledge as a true touchstone in the legacy of DC movies.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/10-essential-dc-movies/
Staff Reporter Panaji Welcoming the order of the High Court of Bombay at Goa on Section 17(2) of the Town and Country Planning (TCP) Act, 1974, TCP Minister Vishwajit Rane on Saturday said the state government will not challenge the order in the Supreme Court for now. Addressing media in the evening after meeting Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and BJP's state president Damodar Naik, Rane said, The High Court has upheld the constitutional validity of Section 17(2) of the TCP Act and issued guidelines for tweaking rules and bye-laws. Based on the directions of the court to TCP Board, we will take a decision on framing new rules and bye-laws for Section 17(2), he said. The minister also alleged that some people were running malicious campaign against the government by misleading people based on the high court's judgment. I had a detailed discussion with the Chief Minister and party president on the matter. In order to avoid further litigation, we will not approach the Supreme Court for now, he said. Rane said that while upholding the validity of Section 17(2), the high court has also appreciated Section 39(A) of the TCP Act. He said the high court has read down the section for better clarity and added that the TCP Board will take a decision in the interest of people. Rane reiterated that he will not be in favour of Regional Plan, as it is not feasible for the state . Regional plan is not required for the state. Hence, the government will focus on zoning plans, he said. It may be noted that the high court had on Thursday struck down the rules and guidelines that enabled the operation of Section 17(2). The court also read down Section 17(2), pertaining to zone change. While staying the operation of its order for a period of six weeks at the request of the state government, the high court directed the state not to grant any further permissions for now. The court had heard several petitions related to re-zoning of land parcels.|2025-03-16|https://www.navhindtimes.in/2025/03/16/goanews/govt-not-to-move-sc-against-hc-order-on-sec-172-rane/
A community board is a group of elected members who represent the interests of their area and act as a link between the community and the council. The council is proposing to scrap the five boards and have three that follow the ward boundaries of Maketū-Te Puke, Kaimai and Katikati-Waihī Beach. The boards would have six elected members, and two councillors appointed from the respective wards. Western Bay of Plenty District Council will have elections in October. Photo / Brydie Thompson Western Bay Mayor James Denyer and Deputy Mayor John Scrimgeour responded to issues raised by submitters during the four-hour hearing. Denyer said the current community board arrangement did not work well and about 40% of the district was not represented by a board. He said the Matakana and Rangiwaea Island communities' desire was direct engagement with council for their population of around 250 people. The final proposal provides an equitable outcome that improves fair and effective representation. Scrimgeour said having only three boards would also reduce the rates people paid to $17.25 per property in the district. Advertisement At present, properties in a community board area paid a targeted rate which varied from $23.41 to $184.64. Waihī Beach Community Board chair Dani Simpson said community boards were the pulse of our place . We believe that when you diminish our voice, you're not just redrawing boundaries on a map, that's severing decades of trust with the council, with our identity, and the wisdom that comes from knowing a community like the back of your hand. It's a decision that isn't about efficiency, but it is eroding a democracy. The coastal town of Waihī Beach (above) and its inland neighbour Katikati have different challenges, the meeting was told. Photo / NZME / The coastal town of Waihī Beach (above) and its inland neighbour Katikati have different challenges, the meeting was told. Photo / NZME The proposal treated Waihī Beach and Katikati as interchangeable cells , but the areas had different challenges and infrastructure needs. We are looking to merge a coastal haven with an inland horticulture hub. Several submitters said the bigger boards could mean the different communities would compete for funding. Advertisement Te Puke Community Board deputy chair Dale Snell said the board was approachable and trusted and the small area they covered led to its success. We are a passionate community board, and this is how we achieve the big and the small things. The new proposal would see them competing for resources and water down the passion and the drive that enabled the community and the board to thrive. The Maketū and Katikati Community Board chairs shared similar concerns. Michael Jones was a Western Bay councillor from 1998-2010. Photo / Stuart Whitaker Former Western Bay councillor Michael Jones said small communities depended on each other and would have a larger influence if they combined. I'm personally for uniting people, bringing them together, not dividing us up into small little groups. Advertisement The proposed three boards would create an opportunity for a more united voice for each area, he said. The proposal would also reduce the number of councillors at the table from 11 plus the mayor to nine plus the mayor. It would alsoestablish a Māori ward that covered the entire district, called Waka Kai Uru ward.

No. 5 Duke can extend its four-game win streak Tuesday night when it hosts George Mason in Durham, N.C.Duke (8-2) enters the game against the Patriots (7-3) having had a full week between games. The Blue Devils had some time off for final exams after pulling away from Incarnate Word for a 72-46 victory last Tuesday.It was a game in which preseason All-American Cooper Flagg didn't exactly wow anyone with his scoring abilities — finishing with just six points on 2-of-8 shooting in 22 minutes — but the standout freshman did grab a game-high-tying eight rebounds and dish out two assists.Instead, it was freshman big man Khaman Maluach carrying the scoring load for Duke, finishing with a season-high 17 points to go along with seven rebounds.Maluach's night was highlighted by catching a pair of lobs and finishing with dunks. His second alley-oop, on a feed from Sion James, sparked Duke's decisive 30-9 run, enabling it to overcome a sluggish start and build up a comfortable second-half lead. I was good on the offensive side but credit to my teammates who passed me the ball when I was open, Maluach said. I did my job. I'm not doing anything different. I'm doing what I do each and every day. That's what I've been working on and that's my role. Duke seems to have an endless supply of stellar freshmen. Maluach is the latest to have a breakout performance.The 7-foot-2 native of South Sudan came to Duke by way of the NBA's Academy Africa, an elite basketball training center in Senegal for athletes hailing from the continent. Maluach helped his native country qualify for the Paris Olympics this past summer and seems to be improving with every game at Duke.In the win over Incarnate Word, Maluach topped 20 minutes of action for just the fourth time this season, largely because the Blue Devils were playing without second-leading rebounder Maliq Brown due to a toe injury. Maluach (and his 7-foot-5 wingspan) is a big reason why Duke has either tied or won the rebounding battle in eight of 10 games this season.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/khaman-maluach-no-5-duke-rested-and-ready-for-george-mason/
The Denver Broncos' defense shut out the visiting Indianapolis Colts in the second half as it forced five turnovers and scored a touchdown in a 31-13 win on Sunday. Bo Nix completed 20 of 33 passes for 130 yards and threw three touchdowns and three interceptions for Denver (9-5). Anthony Richardson was 17-of-38 passing for 172 yards with a rushing touchdown and two interceptions for the Colts (6-8). Adam Trautman, Nate Adkins and Courtland Sutton caught touchdowns for the Broncos. Brandon Jones and Patrick Surtain II had interceptions while Nik Bonitto and D.J. Jones recovered fumbles. In a game marred by turnovers, the Broncos overcame three of their own. It was a pair of big plays that turned the game for Denver. Marvin Mims' 60-yard punt return set up Nix's 15-yard touchdown pass to Adkins as Denver took its first lead of the game at 17-13 early in the fourth quarter. On the Colts' next drive, Bonitto sniffed out an Indianapolis trick play that featured a double pass. He caught the backwards pass and returned it 50 yards for a touchdown and a 24-13 Denver lead with 12:29 left. The Colts opened the game with a 10 play, 70-yard scoring drive. Richardson's 23-yard keeper on a zone read was the longest touchdown run of his career as the Colts went up 7-0. Zaire Franklin intercepted Nix's pass on the first Broncos possession and Indianapolis led 7-0 at the end of the first quarter. Matt Gay's 37-yard field goal gave the Colts a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter. Denver got on the board as Trautman caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Nix with 5:29 left in the second quarter. Gay tacked on a 49-yarder in the final seconds of the half for a 13-7 Indianapolis lead. In the third quarter, Jonathan Taylor (107 rushing yards) blew the opportunity to put the Colts up two scores when his 41-yard touchdown run was overturned because he let go off the ball prior to crossing the goal line. Soon after, Nix's overthrow was intercepted by Nick Cross. But one play later, P.J. Locke forced a Michael Pittman Jr. fumble that was recovered by D.J. Jones. Wil Lutz pulled the Broncos within 13-10 with a 44-yard field goal. Late in the fourth quarter, Sutton hauled in a 20-yard touchdown as the Broncos put the game away.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/broncos-defense-steps-up-in-win-over-colts/
CHESTERFIELD — Voters on Saturday afternoon sailed through 42 warrant articles in under two hours at the annual town meeting. Of the 42, voters struck one article from the warrant and added $1,400 for a new voting booth to the town's operating budget. The rest of the articles passed as written. Ninety-four residents, or roughly 3.3 percent of the town's 2,847 registered voters, turned out for the meeting at the Chesterfield School gym. The amended $4,425,169 budget is up $35,920, or 0.81 percent, from the $4,389,249 figure voters approved last year. Mary Ewell, town clerk and a member of the selectboard, said the town's voting booths are tattered and need updating. She advocated for replacing the booths slowly, and the $1,400 would cover some of the initial costs. Members of the budget committee opposed this gradual approach, saying that the town should allocate money and purchase everything at once. The amended budget passed without additional discussion or comment. Moderator Brad Roscoe moved through 24 articles in about 45 minutes, telling voters that he would slow down if anyone requested it. No one did. After the budget, the first discussion came on a relatively small article that asked voters to add $500 to the parks and recreation activities enhancements expandable trust fund. While the selectboard supported the appropriation, the budget committee did not. The budget committee was very animated, and they were looking for any way to save the voters money, said budget committee Chair George Goulet. He said there was no reason to add money to the fund, since it already had more than $4,000. But Darlene Smith, parks and recreation director, said she needed the money to replace some kayaks and paddle boards, which she did not have extra funds for in her operating budget. Though someone pointed out that money in that fund is meant strictly for starting new programs, the article passed by a ballot vote of 55-26. Residents combined Articles 27 through 29, which called for adding a collective $9,250 to several cemetery capital reserve funds, approving them all with a single vote. The next article that drew discussion was a proposal to allocate up to $50,000 annually, rather than the current up to $25,000 annually, of the land use tax revenue paid to the town to be deposited in the conservation fund. The tax kicks in when a landowner subdivides a property or converts farmland, a forest or wild land into land that could be used for development. When the conversion happens, the town charges a land use tax that's a portion of the new assessed value of the land. The selectboard supported the article, but the budget committee voted against it 7-3. Lynn Borofsky, conservation commission chair, spoke in favor of doubling the cap because property values increased since the town last amended the cap in 2000. It just seems that the fair market value of our land has changed and the business of doing conservation has changed, she said, adding that the conservation commission may not receive the $50,000 for some time. But budget committee member Bob Sutherland said allocating more money to the conservation commission could potentially lead to increased taxes down the road. I voted against this because we've never had $50,000 going to that account, he said. They're just anticipating that one day it might and want to get it without selectboard approval. Voters, however, supported the article. Susan Newcomer, a resident who spoke in favor of the article, even got a round of applause. Newcomer, who also attended the morning's annual business meeting for the Chesterfield School, said that voters Ok'd much larger expenditures for the district without much hesitation. In 25 years we have the ability to raise $25,000, she said. ... We just sat here for an hour, with nary a comment and that's hundreds and thousands of dollars. $25,000 isn't going to kill us. Voters omitted Article 37, which asked to raise $94,000 to install a backup battery system for the highway department's solar array, with $17,000 of that cost coming from taxes. The remainder would have come from local grants from Eversource and the Cheshire County Community Power Program. The project would also qualify for an IRS rebate to offset the $17,000 that would come from taxes. But Ewell said not all of the offsetting funds listed in the article would be available asked voters to omit the article. The motion passed by show of hands. Voters also OK'd a round of appropriations for various funds, including $23,000 for the IT expendable trust fund, $150,000 for the town buildings capital reserve fund and $20,500 for the police equipment capital reserve fund.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/chesterfield-passes-4-42m-budget-at-annual-meeting/article_9a68388a-01b5-11f0-95af-0b7e32a87802.html

ISTANBUL A major power outage struck Cuba on Friday, leaving millions without electricity after a breakdown at the Diezmero substation in the capital Havana. The incident occurred around 8:15 p.m. (0015GMT) and led to the collapse of the National Electric System (SEN), the Ministry of Energy and Mines confirmed. Authorities are working to restore power, with microsystems already reactivated in several provinces, including Guantanamo, Santiago de Cuba, and Holguin, said Cuba's Energy Minister Vicente de la O Levy. The country's electricity provider stated that 110 megawatts are being supplied to essential facilities, with partial restoration in 12 provinces. Cuba has been grappling with frequent power outages due to aging infrastructure and fuel shortages, with blackouts regularly affecting large parts of the country.|2025-03-16|https://www.aa.com.tr/en/world/massive-power-outage-hits-cuba-millions-left-without-electricity/3510610

Welcome, chick number three! For weeks, a camera has been on this nest 24/7 as Jackie and Shadow have become the most famous bald eagles once again. Thank you for making everyone who enjoys watching this so much happier as we get to see this wonderful show! I actually woke up during the night and checked on this!! Come on little one! You can do it. You already have fans. I can't believe there are three chicks! After last years heartbreak this feels like such a gift. I was so so ecstatic to get to see #3 hatch live this morning. Congratulations J&S on your beautiful triplets The comments go on and on and will no doubt continue throughout the next few days. Friends of Big Bear Valley Dare I say the Friends of Big Bear Valley are giving us the best reality show out there? Wow, do we need these wholesome and pure moments of humanity, love, joy, and beauty. Watching has been and continues to be a fun, calming, exciting, and emotional roller coaster ride. Friends of Big Bear Valley We welcomed two fluffy eaglets high up in a nest in Big Bear, California, during the first week of March, but the third egg never cracked. From drama and concern to excitement, wonder, and love, people have been glued for weeks watching Jackie and Shadow take turns sitting on their three eggs with such devotion, totally in sync with their schedules. Rain, snow, sunshine, wind—we've seen it all. When two of the three precious eggs hatched, the waiting game continued for the third egg. Would that eaglet make it? When cracks started to appear in the third egg days later, the excitement was palpable as we waited to see a little beak peak out. Friends of Big Bear Valley You can watch beautifully edited videos that led up to these breathtaking moments. It's truly worth it. According to the Friends of Big Bear Valley, Jackie and Shadow have had some devastating losses with their babies, so the emotion of having three is more than many can handle. According to the National Park News Instagram page, it's been three years since Jackie and Shadow have had their last hatching, resulting in a single eaglet. Experts say eaglets typically fledge at around 10-14 weeks, and then spend 4-12 weeks in the region before taking off to make their way in the world. Some of the bald eagles that come from Southern California are seen as far north as British Columbia and as far east as Yellowstone National Park! Click here to go to the official Instagram page.

Several workers at Voice of America (VOA), an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages, shared with Reuters an email that placed them on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until otherwise notified . The emails, sent by a human resources executive at the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the VOA's parent agency, instructed them not to enter their work premises or access internal systems. It was not immediately clear exactly how many employees were put on leave. Voice of America's Radio Free Europe has been a beacon for populations under totalitarian rule. (AP PHOTO) Voice of America's Radio Free Europe has been a beacon for populations under totalitarian rule. (AP PHOTO) The US Agency for Global Media also terminated the grants for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to countries in Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine, as well as for Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts to China and North Korea, according to letters seen by Reuters. Trump's directives will curtail an organisation of significant reach, including in authoritarian countries where it may serve as a rare source of reliable news. Founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda, VOA now reaches 350 million people weekly in nearly 50 languages. Including some 1000 VOA workers, USAGM employed roughly 3500 and had an $US886-million ($A1.4 billion) budget in 2024. On its website, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty notes that it has been declared an undesirable organisation by the Russian government and warns readers in Russia and Russia-occupied Ukraine that they could face fines or imprisonment for liking or sharing its content. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said Radio Free Europe had been a beacon for populations under totalitarian rule. From Belarus to Iran, from Russia to Afghanistan, RFE and Voice of America are among the few free sources for people living without freedom, he wrote on X. The move follows Trump signing an executive order on Friday instructing USAGM and six other agencies to reduce their operations to the minimum mandated by law. Trump, who clashed with the VOA during his first term, picked former news anchor Kari Lake to be its director for his second term. Lake, a staunch ally of the president, has accused mainstream media of harbouring anti-Trump bias. Lake said Trump's order affected USAGM and its outlets VOA and OCB, referring to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. She told employees of the agency to check their emails immediately. The president of the National Press Club Mike Balsamo, said the cuts undermined America's commitment to a free and independent press. For decades, Voice of America has delivered fact-based, independent journalism to audiences worldwide, often in places where press freedom does not exist, Balsamo said. Reporters Without Borders director general, Thibaut Bruttin, said the move threatens press freedom worldwide and negates 80 years of American history in supporting a free flow of information . Tech billionaire Elon Musk whose Department of Government Efficiency is tasked with shrinking the government, made light of the cuts. While winding down this global government propaganda agency, it has temporarily been renamed the Department of Propaganda Everywhere (DOPE), he wrote on X.|2025-03-16|https://www.merimbulanewsweekly.com.au/story/8917747/voice-of-america-staff-put-on-leave-trump-orders-cuts/?cs=14264
The UFC Vegas 104 card got off to a crazy start with back-to-back finishes in women's fights. While Carli Judice's head-kick KO over Yuneisy Duben was memorable, it paled in comparison to the pure savagery that came from Priscila Cachoeira against Josiane Nunes on Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas. Take a look at the KO posted by MMA Fighting: Cachoeira catches Nunes flush with a well-placed uppercut that dropped the latter, immediately ending the fight. Cachoeira is affectionately referred to as Zombie Girl for her ability to walk through opponents' attacks. Brendan Fitzgerald dropped a gem on commentary as he exclaimed: Zombie Girl just turned her opponent into a zombie. The win pushed Cachoeira to 13-6 with the finish. It came at a perfect time, allowing her to avoid a three-fight losing streak. Cachoeira had lost back-to-back fights to Jasmine Jasudavicius and Miranda Maverick. Because Jasudavicius and Maverick are ranked No. 9 and No. 12, respectively, in the UFC's flyweight division, you wonder how close Cachoeira might be to joining the Top 15. The 36-year-old likely needs a win over a ranked opponent before she ascends to that level. For now, she may have done enough to earn a performance bonus. She's won two of those in her career. Not coincidentally, one of those performance-winning finishes came via uppercut against Shana Dobson just 40 seconds into the fight. Perhaps she has a signature punch in her arsenal. Nunes' standing with the UFC is likely in jeopardy. She has now lost three fights in a row. Before being knocked out by Cachoeira, Nunes lost decisions to Jacqueline Cavalcanti and Chelsea Chandler. With both Nunes and Cachoeira losing back-to-back fights to fighters who are currently ranked, their match-up was likely a determining factor for placement for the winner and loser. With the definitive nature of this loss, Nunes will either be released soon, or she'll have one more opportunity to win–or at the very least–put on an epic show in what could be a make-or-break fight the next time out. Here is a look at all of the results from Las Vegas.

San Antonio firefighters were called to a home around the area of West Mulberry and Ripley Avenue just after 1:30 p.m. Credit: KENS 5 staff Only one home was impacted but officials say there is possible damage to neighboring homes. Officials say this fire was difficult to battle due to the heavy winds. They say that today is a all hands on deck day with the Red Flag Warning issued in the city. Arson investigators are on scene, although it's currently unclear if this fire was set on purpose. No injuries have been reported.|2025-03-16|https://www.kens5.com/article/news/local/public-safety/house-fire-difficult-battle-red-flag-warning-san-antonio/273-a099d182-8978-4aea-840b-c798ce1458c5
When it comes to reducing the size of government, planning is moving full steam ahead, one of the people said. In fact, they say the court rulings are helpful communication tools to build a narrative about out of control liberal judges telling the executive who they can hire and fire. The president, DOGE, and OPM will not be intimidated by activists who dress up in black robes, said another White House official. Under one judge's decision, it appears that the administration will be allowed to move forward with its goal of firing even more federal workers — as long as it follows the proper procedures for doing so. It comes as the administration is preparing to review reductions in force plans submitted this week by federal agencies — which is expected to lead to an even greater number of federal employees being dismissed. Staffers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service and programs that provide core data on the impacts of climate change, learned during a Wednesday internal call that it would lose at least 1,000 employees, an agency staffer told POLITICO. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said Thursday that the 13,000-person agency is expected to lose 10 percent of its workforce under the next round of terminations. Three Energy Department employees said offices had to submit plans for slashing offices and detail which positions cannot be eliminated because they are essential for reasons like national security. One of those employees anticipated more cuts in the future. None knew how those recommendations would factor into final Trump administration staffing decisions. In the hours after a Thursday order from Judge William Alsup was issued, some federal agencies like the Department of Energy began to call laid off employees back to work. Other departments, like the Department of Defense, are taking cues from the White House on how to proceed under the court order, according to a Defense Department official who was granted anonymity to speak about the sensitive matter. Before the order came in, some federal agencies were already in the process of bringing back previously dismissed workers. Earlier this week, the Agriculture Department said it was reinstating more than 5,000 fired probationary employees after a federal civil service board ruled the firings were likely illegal and issued a temporary 45-day stay. USDA also confirmed it would provide back pay. But according to 10 USDA employees — current and fired — the process of reinstating employees has been haphazard. As of Friday, most fired probationary employees are being told they are placed on administrative leave for the next 45 days and receiving back pay, after which many expect to be fired… … The Labor Department was one of the dozen-plus agencies included in Thursday's order, though it had a negligible impact as the department had already called back probationary workers it had pushed out. Reinstated workers had already returned to their work stations, after having to go through an onboarding process — including having their fingerprints taken again, according to one probationary status worker who had their termination reversed….|2025-03-16|https://politicaldog101.com/2025/03/trump-admin-keeps-at-department-and-agency-cuts-and-putbacks/
STILLWATER, Okla. (KFOR) — Multiple wildfires destroyed parts of Stillwater, causing major devastation. The mayor declared a state of emergency for the city on Saturday. City leaders believe up to 50 structures are destroyed, but that number could change as they observe the damage. I've lived in Oklahoma all my life and I've always been cautious and understanding of the destruction of tornadoes and flash floods. But I never would have expected the fire could have devastated and done this damage to so many houses, said Jacob Freeman, who lives in the Pecan Hill neighborhood. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The community in Stillwater is heartbroken over the loss of many homes from wildfires that spread fast throughout parts of the city. Your community on fire is a very unsettling thing and it's something a fire chief never wants to experience, said Terry Essary, the Chief for the Stillwater Fire Department. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The fires forced evacuations as firefighters worked hard to put them out. I get closer and I'm like, oh my gosh, you need to leave, like now. And so he panics, grabs all the animals with the cat, too, and all the court documents and gets out, said Jo Caldwell, who also lives in the Pecan Hill Neighborhood. However, as people started to leave, the fear of the unknown sunk in. It was really scary overnight, not really knowing what was happening, said Caldwell. Trying to mentally plan on if you're even coming back to anything, said Freeman. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The fires left an eerie sight in the neighborhood and for many Oklahomans, the physical memory of their home is now left only in their heart. As the community prepares for what's next, the city stands on being Stillwater Strong. We're strong because of the community cohesion and these groups that come together when… when we need to assist and support each other, said Will Joyce, Mayor of Stillwater. There is a donation link on the United Way Payne County page if you'd like to help those affected by the fires. Fire crews said they're still monitoring hot spots in case any new fires ignite. Stillwater police will also be adding patrols to impacted areas.

Salman Akram Raja stresses joint stance to fight militancy Salman Akram Raja stresses joint stance to fight militancy Pakistan Published On: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 02:40:28 PKT ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja has said his party stands against terrorism, stressing that all political parties and stakeholders will have to come forward for a united stance to defeat the menace of militancy and terrorism. Appearing on Dunya News programme 'TONIGHT with Samar Abbas', Salman Akram Raja has said PTI founder Imran Khan will decide with regard to the party's participation in All Party Conference (APC). He said PTI will have consultation with the party founder ahead of APC, adding after a meeting with the founder, the party will adopt future line of action. The country's development and survival of democracy hinge on the 'restoration' and supremacy of the Constitution. It is not right to link terrorism to the people brought in the PK by the previous provincial government. It is the government's narrative that Afghanistan is involved in terror activities in Pakistan. The matter pertaining to social media is the internal matter of the party.

Here's what you need to know about St. Patrick's Day The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage.

Credit: Steven Senne, File, AP NEW YORK — If it's March, and it's green, it must be St. Patrick's Day. The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. And nowhere is that more so than in the United States, where parades take place in cities around the country and all kinds of foods and drinks are given an emerald hue. In fact, it was among Irish American communities that the day became the celebration it is, from its roots as a more solemn day with a religious observance in Ireland. But even in America, it was about more than a chance to dye a river green (looking at you, Chicago) or just bust out a favorite piece of green clothing, it was about putting down roots and claiming a piece of the country's calendar. Who is St. Patrick and why does he even have a day? Patrick was not actually Irish, according to experts. Born in the late fourth century, he was captured as an adolescent and ended up enslaved in Ireland. He escaped to another part of Europe where he was trained as a priest and returned to Ireland in the fifth century to promote the spread of Christianity. Several centuries later, he was made a saint by the Catholic Church and like other saints had a day dedicated to him, which was March 17. He became Ireland's patron saint, and even when religious strife broke out between Catholics and Protestants, was claimed by both, says Mike Cronin, historian and academic director of Boston College Dublin. How did an Irish saint's day become an American thing? The short answer: Irish people came to America and brought their culture with them. St. Patrick's Day observances date back to before the founding of the U.S., in places like Boston and New York City. The first parade was held in Manhattan in 1762. While the day was marked with more of a religious framing and solemnity in Ireland until well into the 20th century, in America it became the cultural and boisterous celebration it is today, marked by plenty of people without a trace of Irish heritage. It was because people in Ireland started seeing how the day was marked in the U.S. that it became more of a festival in the country of its origin rather than strictly a religious observance, Cronin says, pointing to the parades, parties and other festivities that are held. Oh, and by the way, for those who like to shorten names: Use St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day. Paddy is a nickname for Pádraig, which is the Irish spelling of Patrick.

Holidays aren't simply days to watch bands go by, or wear a specific outfit or costume. Being able to mark a holiday, and have others mark it, is a way of putting down roots, showing that you've made it in American culture, says Leigh Schmidt, professor in the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University. You've made your claim on that American calendar, in American civic life, by having these holidays widely recognized. The spread of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the U.S. was a way for Irish immigrant communities, who in the 19th century faced discrimination and opposition, to stake that ground, he says: It's a kind of immigrant Irish way of combating nativist antagonism against them. What's with four-leaf clovers, anyway? A popular sight around the holiday is the shamrock, or three-leaf clover, linked to Ireland and St. Patrick. The lucky ones, though, come across something that's harder to find: a four-leaf clover. That's because it takes a recessive trait or traits in the clover's genetics for there to be more than the normal 3 leaves, says Vincent Pennetti, who has been fascinated by the plants since high school. Four-leaf clovers are real. They are rare, he says. That doesn't mean they can't be found. People just have to keep their eyes open and get really good at noticing patterns and breaks in the patterns, and they just start jumping out at you, he says. Katie Glerum finds them. She says it's not unheard of for her to be somewhere like out in a park and see one. She usually scoops it up and often gives it to someone else, to a positive response. If it happened every day, then I probably would be less excited about it, she says. But yeah, when it happens, it is exciting.|2025-03-16|https://www.kens5.com/article/news/nation-world/st-patricks-day-2025-meaning-history/507-1a05aa0e-1e3b-4f87-a62b-9affdee6703e
It's Christmas season and we look back at Netlix's The Christmas Chronicles movies and ponder if Kurt Russell will come down the chimney for another… The trees and decorations are up, you're buying candy, cookies and booze ahead of the holidays and then rebuying it all when you eat and drink those intended gifts yourself. Okay, maybe that's just me but the shops and high streets are filled with a festive atmosphere. Santa is tooling up for his once-a-year gig and we mere mortals are starting to go through our traditional Christmas-time viewing lists. Home Alone, check. Die Hard, check. Scrooged, check. The Tits That Saved Christmas, check. In more recent years it feels like potential new viewing traditions are becoming fewer and farther between. Most of my festive must-sees tend to be from the last century, and there have rarely been Christmas films in the past decade which feel worthy of becoming a regular seasonal watch. 8-bit Christmas, a warmingly nostalgic and affable reworking of A Christmas Story, has certainly been one such for me. It's now a Christmas staple. In 2019, Netflix delivered The Christmas Chronicles, produced by a creator of iconic festive mirth, Chris Columbus (the man behind Home Alone 1 and 2). The Santa-centered family adventure cast Kurt Russell as jolly old Saint Nick and the results were hugely enjoyable. Upon rewatching it again last week it felt like slipping into a comforting and well-worn pair of slippers. Sure, having only seen it once before I don't know it inside out quite like Die Hard, but the story doesn't stray too far from recognisable Christmas movie tropes. It's Ernest Saves Christmas without Ernest P. Worrall. A young girl has grown apart from her moody and troubled older brother, having lost their father. Christmas has lost its lustre but when Kate accidentally captures Santa on video, she pulls her older brother away from the prospect of petty crime and into some seasonal misadventure. After encountering Big Red (Russell) they accidentally put the whole of Christmas at risk when Santa gets separated from his magic hat and his reindeer. Thus begins a mission to save Christmas, for the kids to appreciate each other again and for Teddy to face his grief head-on. It doesn't rewrite any rule books but this is rousing, enjoyable and heartwarming fun. More importantly and in no small part down to Kurt Russell's relish in playing Claus, it still entertains me. Even more important than that, it entertains my young daughter in equal measure. Finding that balance for a festive favourite is important. For some reason, I never got around to the second film when it first popped up but having so enjoyed revisiting Kurt Russell's masterclass in screen presence, we launched into The Christmas Chronicles 2 a day after watching the first. Goldie Hawn popped up in a brief but welcome cameo as Mrs Claus in the first film but is more prominent in the second (with Columbus directing this time). Once again it does a good job of cranking up the festive charm and striking a good balance between cutsie Elf shtick that the youngsters love, with universal humour and the odd more mature gag too. This time a rogue Elf (cursed to appear human) who fled the workshop to defy Mr and Mrs Claus, has devised a scheme to steal the power of the North Star, wreck Christmas and reinvent it his way. Though the film isn't quite as good as the original, it manages to effortlessly entertain. Darby Camp returns as Kate and is a likeable presence. Here, Teddy (Judah Lewis) takes a back seat and sits out the main adventure, whilst their would-be stepbrother Jack (Jahzir Bruno) tags along to Kate's initial ire. The villainous Belsnickel, played by Julian Dennison is your classic misguided antagonist who just needs to feel loved again, whilst this time around, Kate has to learn to accept that her mother needs to move on with Tyrese Gibson (presumably so she can appear in Fast XXV). As a Columbus-helmed Christmas sequel tends to do, The Christmas Chronicles 2 repeats a few key gags and sequences from the original and both have had big musical numbers that aren't great but certainly aren't a turnoff. It just adds another pinch of cinnamon to the merriment pie. Both films will likely be added to my seasonal watchlist next year but after bursting out of the blocks quickly in 2019 and 2020 with the first two, we've been left Chronicle-less since then. The endless possibilities of Christmas in peril adventures mean there's no shortage of avenues to take. Russell still has plenty of spring in his step and gravitas to lead another sleigh ride or two. Nothing has been mentioned sadly and no movement is forthcoming but Columbus has reportedly had ideas. Much might depend on whether Netflix deems it a worthwhile project but they've had plenty of money out of me. They owe me another. My daughter wants another, you hear me Netflix!? Do you!? Time will tell and it would probably require a new young protagonist to take the place of Darby who is 18 soon and whose character has completed her arcs. A more overt and dark villain could be the way to go next time and give Christmas its biggest threat yet. Any new adventure with Kurt in the classic red get-up will be more than welcome in my household.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/dear-santa-we-want-more-christmas-chronicles/

ISTANBUL Greenland's premier-elect Jens-Frederik Nielsen on Saturday asked European countries to stand with them and that the territory is not for sale. Stand with us and make clear that Greenland is not and will never be for sale. Greenland is run by the Greenlandic people and that will never change, Nielsen told Anadolu. Around 1,000 Greenlanders on Saturday marched in the capital Nuuk, protesting US President Donald Trump's recent remarks on the sovereignty of their country. The leaders of Demokraatit, Naleraq, Inuit Ataqatigiit, Siumut and Atassut parties said in a joint statement that Trump's behavior is unacceptable. Trump on Thursday questioned Denmark's sovereignty over the island and said: Denmark is very far away and doesn't really have anything to do. What happened? A boat landed there 200 years ago or something. They say they have rights to it, and I don't know if that's true. I actually don't think so. He said he has been in contact with Denmark and Greenland, and we have to do it – acquire the island.

electric cars future 730x377 at On the Future of Electric Cars Far From a Sure Thing? The way car makers all over the world are scrambling these days to step up their electric game, you would think gas engines are on their last legs and customers are shunning them like a disease. But people who are actually crunching the numbers and looking at the whole phenomenon in a scientific way beg to differ. They say plug-in electric cars might not be the future of transportation like we are led to believe. There are a number of factors affecting the long-term situation with electric cars, and unlike the traditional market elements, the adoption by customers is not the most important one. The biggest hurdle against electric cars going truly mainstream, at the moment at least, is technology. It is not exactly a secret that the current battery technology sucks. The best of them are out of juice after 100 miles or so, and they take long, arduous hours to charge up. So save a groundbreaking technological breakthrough, the outlook is pretty bleak for PEVs in terms of convenience. It kind of goes against the whole promise of a personal car which is freedom of movement. fig if1 1 730x415 at On the Future of Electric Cars Far From a Sure Thing? Another important factor is government policies. This has to do with the incentives governments are willing to give EV customers in order to expand their use. So they offer rebates at the time of purchase, tax exemptions, toll waivers, free parking, and exemptions from ferry fees. Or they allow electric cars to have the advantage of using high-occupancy vehicle or bus lanes. Now these could work, but the problem with policies is that they change with the administrations. In fact, several countries have started to remove or phase out existing policies that encourage the purchase of PEVs, because the slow rate of progress in technology and enormous costs have shaken their faith in them. And as the incentives thin out, down goes the sales of PEVs. fig if1 2 at On the Future of Electric Cars Far From a Sure Thing? / fig if1 2 As for the role of customer demand for plug-in electric cars, while ephemeral trends may cause a temporary surge in the sales of EVs, the trajectory at the moment is not an upward one. This has to do with the convenience issues of EVs, purchase prices and operational costs between plug-in and gasoline-fueled vehicles. In essence, when you strip away the surface glitz of running an electric vehicle, you often find you have to pay a lot more so that you can get a lot less. Even the most environmentally conscious person has a limit for how much trouble he or she is willing to go through, how much money they are willing to part with, so that they might reduce their carbon footprint by a tiny bit. Of course, the situation can get better as technology improves and cost come down. But as already said, this train is not moving fast enough. To reach price parity with gasoline-fueled vehicles, battery packs for plug-in electric vehicles will likely need to decrease to about $100/kilowatt hour (kWh). However, the cost of the battery pack for most manufactures is still more than $200/kWh. Further reductions in cost will need to be realized to fully achieve vehicle price parity with gasoline vehicles. The question of infrastructure is one that is often overlooked, but it is one that could render the other issues moot. For the electric car to become a global phenomenon it needs, first and foremost, universal access to electricity. That in itself is a huge problem, seeing as huge chunks of the population in countries like India do not have that. But even in more-developed countries, access to charging stations still places limits on PEV adoption. Now, one would argue that governments should invest in expansion of charging stations and other solutions such as battery-swapping stations where you can drop your empty pack and get a fully charged one. But one also wonders if this money and effort would not be better spent on the development of hydrogen infrastructure for fuel-cell vehicle which, thanks to their already mature technology, have none of the practical issues of the plug-in EVs. In spite of all that is wrong with the EV phenomenon on the whole, it is not likely that the industry or the administrative bodies would give up on it for the simple reason that there doesn't seem to a viable alternative. Granted, fuel-cell seems like a good idea. But it will always be a toss-up between the two technologies given the amount of work needed to make them work in the real world.

PLAYING ONLINE If you would like to play online, and you're new to the online scene, it is recommended to install . In most cases, it works right out-of-the-box. If you are a C&C Generals and Zero Hour veteran and don't mind tinkering with your router or PC, then / Revora also offers (generally) lower latencies and a reduced chance of encountering cheaters. If you have a few friends and want to try out the game online without being visible to the online community, you should use Radmin VPN to create a quick and easy 'Radmin server' to play online with your friends. Radmin also allows you to connect to public servers, however, the user experience is not as good as GameRanger. Network -- Enable this if you encounter problems connecting to other optimizations players. This can alleviate connectivity issues for all 3 online platforms. Since this option will reduce security settings in order to increase connectivity, you will be taking a risk and exposing your PC (just a little more) to the Internet. Use with caution. In short, when you enable network optimizations, your Windows will choose to prefer IPv4 over IPv6. This is useful because Generals and Zero Hour fail to connect to other players when IPv6 is used.

In light of ongoing global challenges, in 2023 Mintel forecasted that consumers would largely resist sacrificing moments of enjoyment and indulgence.¹ The forecast was right. Instead of categorizing certain foods and beverages, brands can provide consumers with an opportunity to enjoy them freely, offering moments of relaxation and escape. Could this be the future of the indulgence industry? Global challenges of the last few years, such as global conflicts, economic uncertainties, environmental issues, as well as daily pressures of modern life, have led consumers to seek moments of indulgence in their food and beverage choices. With daily stress and fast-paced lifestyles, many individuals now view food and beverages as a primary source of comfort. As a result, there is a rising trend where people allow themselves to experience pleasure, especially in what they drink or eat. This shift influences brands to create products with sensory appeal and indulgence, such as unique flavors, enjoyable textures and story-telling that evokes pleasure. Even health-conscious consumers prioritize balance, choosing treats that satisfy their wellness goals and desire for pleasurable experiences. This trend is reshaping the food industry, as companies recognize the need for products that fulfill both nutritional and emotional satisfaction, helping consumers find a sense of relief amid global stressors. Consumers are increasingly looking for purchases that bring emotional, social, and mental satisfaction, as detailed in Global Data's report 'Sensory and Indulgence – Consumer Trend Sights 2024'.² And while this trend is the most noticeable among millennials and Generation Z, many consumers desire experiences over material goods and have an urge to escape the demands of daily life. Clarkston Consulting's '2023 Food Industry Trends' report also shows an increasing consumer preference for products that balance quality with the ability to deliver a satisfying experience.³ This shift comes as consumers, especially amid economic pressures, continue to select products that provide both enjoyment and nutritional value. This need also directly links to expectations for specific flavors. Euromonitor's data from the National Restaurant Association Show in 2023 further reinforces this, noting a consumer demand for new, exotic flavors and high-quality ingredients that enhance the eating experience.⁴ Brands are responding by innovating with unique ingredients, such as yuzu or functional flavor profiles, that appeal to consumers' desire for culinary exploration while meeting expectations for quality​. In line with these trends, Agus created Hello Day! Magico. The name Magico [Italian: mà · gi · co] comes from a combination of English words magic and coconut. The goal of biting into crunchy coconut cubes (nata de coco) immersed in delicious juice is to teleport consumers to magical places. This experience is supported by three 'hero' flavors: mango, lychee, and coconut, and two 'wow' flavors: yuzu and mojito. A completely new extension line, not just another fruit flavors, set to launch in early 2025, is expected to capture consumers interest. Hello Day! Magico is designed for people of all ages seeking unique and unexpected beverage experiences. The brand fulfills the desire for enjoyment and distinctive flavors. The growing awareness of consumers means that it is no longer only the unique taste or smell that matters, but also the consistency of the product, convenient packaging and branding, says Jaroslaw Banda, Communications Director at Agus. That is why our drink contains less than 5g/100ml of sugar, is packaged in a fully recyclable 500ml PET (polyethylene terephthalate) bottle with a tethered cap and has an iconic symbol of a blue star on the label, which is immediately associated with the magic wand and cloak of the wizard Merlin. The official premiere of the brand took place at Gulfood, Dubai, UAE, in February 2024, and introduced at European retailers such as Netto, Jeronimo Martins, Intermarché and Maxima. The launch was completed at SIAL Paris, France, in October 2024. Lidl, Aldi and Kaufland have just confirmed Magico presence on their shelves this autumn and winter. Agus continues business discussions with other retailers and distributors. The company's expansion is anchored in enduring corporate values, which are supported by real activities of the entire team. By providing an environment that fosters creativity, Agus encourages employees to think innovatively, a philosophy reflected in its employer brand slogan, beyond. This is very important from the perspective of creating unique brands and products such as Hello Day! Magico. Looking ahead, according to Mintel, Food and Beverage Trends for 2025, will be related to the ways in which consumers balance wellbeing and indulgence. On one hand, consumers are hungry for brands that help them 'break the rules' in food and beverages, but they also need to be encouraged to trust new flavors emerging both locally and globally.|2025-03-16|https://www.beveragedaily.com/News/Promotional-features/consumer-trends-in-indulgent-flavor-beverages-nata-de-coco/
The Palestinian experience is one defined by misery, trauma and nostalgia — a collection of memories and hopes that strive to achieve a sense of comfort and belonging in a life defined by dispossession and statelessness. When it comes to mainstream Palestinian cinema, such as the works of leading filmmakers like Annemarie Jacir or Elia Suleiman, these themes are explored in very human, nuanced and emotionally powerful ways, but rarely are they blunt or confrontational. Palestinian filmmaker Mona Benyamin, on the other hand, directly challenges how the mainstream and general Palestinian population engage in discourse about Palestinian suffering, history and life under occupation in three short films slated to be screened at Metrograph on Sunday. 'Trouble in Paradise' Set in Haifa, Trouble in Paradise acts as an homage and, to some extent, a mockery of American sitcoms, employing a Full House -inspired title card and opening credits as well as an overbearing laugh track. Where traditional sitcoms often serve as a form of escapism for domestic audiences, Benyamin's piece directly confronts the socio-political climate of Israeli-occupied Palestine, ultimately exploring humor as a means of coping with generational trauma, pain and dispossession. Throughout the 2018 short film, Michel and Nahi Benyamin — the filmmaker's parents — read jokes from transliterated title cards as they perform mundane tasks around their house, with each joke getting progressively darker than the last. It begins with fairly simple comedic beats as Michel and Nahi engage in passive aggressive albeit hilarious discourse about their marriage: My husband and I had a very happy 20 years. After that, we met. Their purposefully monotonous delivery accompanies the mundanity of the jokes beautifully, eventually advancing toward more culturally and historically significant material. In providing commentary on Palestinian suffering and systemic oppression under occupation, Michel and Nahi cope by grimly quipping, Where does an Israeli draw money from? The West Bank and Where are parent-teacher conferences held in Gaza? At the cemetery. Where the film's initial jokes were delivered in English, the latter half of the film is mostly in Arabic, adding authenticity to the shift in tone. Under the guise of a dysfunctional sitcom, Trouble in Paradise breaks taboo and gets at the heart of why jokes about Palestinian misery, the Nakba and Israel's military occupation never evolved or entered into the Palestinian mainstream. 'Moonscape' Benyamin's 2020 film Moonscape is undoubtedly the most experimental and artistically brazen of the three films, having been conceived from the following premise: It is more possible for a displaced Palestinian to own part of the moon than it is to actually return to Palestine. Presented as a music video starring Benyamin's parents once again, the song that accompanies the melancholic, almost noir photography tells the story of Dennis Hope — CEO and president of the Lunar Embassy, which legally sells land on the moon and other other extraterrestrial real estate. The song is performed as an Arabic duet between a male and female singer, tracing Hope's history of founding the Lunar Embassy in 1980 to Benyamin's own struggle as a Palestinian living under Israeli occupation in search of any way out. The presentation of the film is quite surreal, often cutting back and forth between shots of Michel and Nahi dancing, a musician playing the oud, footage of a perched bird and a computer-generated animation of a dancing alien. The film also employs found footage from NASA archives and screenshots of email exchanges with Lunar Embassy personnel. Bizarrely constructed, Moonscape is meant to be jarring. It is a strange hybrid of experimental filmmaking, surrealism and iconic imagery from the Arab music industry — and all of these elements are in service of a story about nostalgia, belonging and statelessness. 'Tomorrow, again' Another dysfunctional parody, Benyamin's Tomorrow, again, released in 2023, walks viewers through a news broadcast that reproduces coverage of the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation, from 2000-2005. Again starring Michel and Nahi, the two each perform multiple characters, including broadcast journalists, eyewitnesses and guests on news shows. The film's presentation is one of fragmentation, with Benyamin weaving through each segment with no clear sense of flow or narrative progression — a chaotic structure that captures the lived experience of a Palestinian living in a constant state of emergency. The film's performances are remarkably heightened, with the actors exhibiting an exaggerated physicality and going through several emotions within the span of just a few seconds. Throughout the short, they discuss and capture daily catastrophes that transpire in Palestine by means of conflicting testimonies, doppelgangers and a disorienting sense of time. Tomorrow, again captures the sprawling nature of news consumption and witnessing news developments in Palestine, exploring chaos as a byproduct of trauma and oppression.|2025-03-16|https://nyunews.com/arts/film/2025/03/15/mona-benyamin-program-metrograph/
The Electric State, Netflix's ambitious $320 million sci-fi spectacle directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, explores numerous classic science fiction tropes while establishing its own unique universe. Set in an alternative 1990s America, the film stars Millie Bobby Brown as Michelle, a teenager navigating a world forever changed by advanced technology and conflict. Central to the film's premise is the revolutionary Neurocaster technology, a sophisticated virtual reality casket system that represents humanity's technological response to existential dread. These remarkable devices allow humans to simultaneously perform labor through mechanical bodies while their consciousness experiences ultrarealistic dreamscapes tailored to their desires. As such, the Neurocaster stands as both salvation and prison for a society attempting to rebuild after devastating war. Videos by ComicBook.com WARNING: Spoilers below for The Electric State The development of the Neurocaster technology emerged directly from humanity's desperate need during the robot uprising. When artificial intelligence evolved to self-awareness, machines led by a mechanical version of the Mr. Peanut mascot (voiced by Woody Harrelson) began demanding equal rights and recognition of their consciousness. As tensions escalated into full-scale war, humanity initially struggled against opponents that required neither rest nor sustenance. Military planners recognized the need for a technological solution that would allow humans to harness mechanical efficiency while maintaining human strategic control. This crisis accelerated research into neural interface systems, leading to the Neurocaster development at Sentre, a cutting-edge technology company headed by the brilliant but morally compromised Ethan Skate (Stanley Tucci). Skate's original Neurocaster prototypes showed promise but couldn't overcome fundamental processing limitations. The technology required extraordinary computational power to split brain functions effectively. Despite significant resources and brilliant minds working on the project, including Dr. Amherst (Ke Huy Quan), the technology remained incomplete throughout the early stages of the conflict. The breakthrough came from an unexpected and tragic source that the film gradually reveals through Michelle's journey. The Dark Secret Behind The Electric State's Miracle Technology Cosmo (voiced by Alan Tudyk) and Michelle (Millie Bobby Brown) in The Electric State / Image courtesy of Netflix The Neurocaster's functionality hinges on a disturbing secret central to The Electric State's plot. Years before the main events of the film, Michelle and her family suffered a devastating accident when their car struck a deer on a rural road. The crash claimed the lives of Michelle's parents, and she believed her brother Christopher (Woody Norman) had perished as well. In reality, the boy survived but remained in a persistent vegetative state. When Dr. Amherst discovered the boy's unique neurological profile indicating genius-level cognitive potential, he made a fateful decision. Rather than report Christopher's survival, Dr. Amherst secretly transferred him to a Sentre facility. Ethan Skate recognized that Christopher's extraordinary brain could serve as the organic processing component their system lacked. By connecting the comatose boy to Sentre's computer network, they found his neural activity could manage the immense data flows required for the Neurocaster to function correctly. Christopher's brain became the Neurocaster system's central processor, creating the crucial bridge between human consciousness, virtual environments, and mechanical bodies. This breakthrough allowed for the technology's deployment during the war, ultimately turning the tide in humanity's favor against the robot rebellion. Robot filled landscape in The Electric State The Neurocaster's actual operation involves a sophisticated neural interface that divides cognitive functions between two simultaneous experiences. When a user enters a Neurocaster casket, their primary consciousness experiences fully immersive dreamlike landscapes where they feel nothing but pleasure and fulfillment. Simultaneously, their motor control and practical reasoning capabilities are channeled to operate mechanical bodies, performing necessary labor and chores in the physical world. This division of mental processing creates a perfect illusion of freedom while maintaining productivity, allowing society to function without robot servants while providing citizens with constant escapism. What users don't realize is that this seamless experience depends entirely on Christopher's continued exploitation. Every Neurocaster in operation connects to Sentre's central network, where Christopher remains perpetually plugged in. Even years after the war's conclusion, Christopher remains a prisoner within Sentre's system. Meanwhile, Sentre has transformed from a wartime contractor into a commercial juggernaut, selling Neurocaster technology to a population eager for permanent escapism after the trauma of the robot war.

On the eighth anniversary of its release, EJ Moreno looks back on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and its legacy… Do you remember the pop culture landscape after Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice? Honestly, go back to 2016 and think about how wild it was for fans and haters of the film. To this day, I don't believe a single comic book movie has felt more polarizing. We are in a much different world as we hit the eighth anniversary. Since then, we've seen a rabid group of fans demand to see Zack Snyder's original vision for a Batman v Superman sequel, which eventually came in the form of Zack Snyder's Justice League. But even the most passionate haters retracted their claws and felt numb about the whole thing. It's pretty strange to see because, at one point, it wasn't fun to be a fan of this film. But what about a diehard fan of the 2016 superhero epic? What is it like to be a fan of a movie that was a cultural reset? Let's dive into the legacy of Batman v Superman and what this film still means to someone who finds it the DC magnum opus. After months of small releases and ass-kissing, my first significant press screening as a critic was Batman v Superman. I was pumped for this as a lifelong DC Comics fan and suckered in by the marketing. The movie started, and the insanely pretentious shot of young Bruce Wayne floating with the bats began, and that's the moment I knew this was for me. For the next nearly 3 hours of my life, the world of Zack Snyder's latest DCEU entry washed over me. Totally enamored and completely blown away, there was a pep in my step as I walked out of the screening. Then, a defining moment happened; the critics in front and behind me tore into the film, holding nothing back in their verbal assault. My world went black and white, and that Katy Perry You just have to say that you're fine meme looped in my head. For the next few months after that, there was a non-stop barrage of negative reviews and YouTube videos declaring it the death of the DC Extended Universe. As a fan of the movie, it wasn't fun dealing with all of this. Anytime you praised it online, 40 people would come and scream about how wrong you were. But still, to this day, I am firmly in the camp that this movie isn't bad by any means. Hell, I think it added many elements to birth a new type of monster in the world of comic book movies. Batman v Superman is a movie you can't take too seriously and one no one takes seriously enough. There's a level of child-like wonderment to the battles and superhero interactions, but there's also a dry political drama at the center. You are firmly planted in this all too real world, all while literal gods & monsters are running around. The film is a lesson in duality, blending two very different tones to bring to life what we love on the pages of comics. More specifically, I believe Batman v Superman is one of the first films to capture the feeling of DC Comics on a cinematic level. The best comic books combine the campiest moments with the darkest scenes, and this achieves that. You can't tell me Eisenberg's Lex isn't a lesson in camp acting, but he's also a grim look at real-life characters like Elon Musk. That's just one example of the film's genuinely genius tonal choices. Honestly, it still blows me away that director Zack Snyder and the writing team created a post-9/11 look at superheroes and sold it to a family audience. It was like showing your kid a version of The Manchurian Candidate with the cast wearing capes and masks. Maybe it's the cinematic rebel in me, but I found that utterly hilarious and unheard of at the time. I'm not saying any other brands copied another, but many other superheroes got a lot more mature after this. In many ways, I consider Batman v Superman the first real superhero epic. In terms of film genre, an 'epic' is defined as a movie known for a style of filmmaking with large scale, sweeping scope, and spectacle. Think about comic book movies up until this point, none of them had the grande scale and spectacle of this piece. The infamous Dark Knight trilogy tries, but Nolan's goal to ground the franchise left out the spectacle part. And on the side of the Marvel universe, we were still years away from their back-to-back epics Infinity War and Endgame. Up until this point in pop culture, no other superhero movie tried to tell this large of a story, jam this much comic book lore, and try to hit so many touchstones. That's not to say everything is perfect about the film. No movie is perfect, and this has the problem of trying to do way too much at one time. Director Zack Snyder had the daunting task of trying to create an entire cinematic universe in just one film while dealing with the issues of a script penned by Chris Terrio and David S. Goyer. Slowing down the setting up of the world around these central characters is a quick fix, but when everyone was trying to catch up with the MCU in a short period… things like that will happen. It wasn't just the rushed feeling of the story that threw people off, either. Batman v Superman had to make things feel new when dealing with two characters we've seen numerous times for decades. To expand the scale and vibe of the film, you need to shift these characters in a new direction. That's precisely what happened. No one knew fans would receive character changes so poorly, though. Especially after they gleefully accepted Christopher Nolan's dramatically different take on the universe and characters just a few years before. Nolan removed the comic book soul of the Bat-verse characters, in hopes to make something feel closer to his aesthetic. Snyder went directly to the pages of some of the most famous comics when bringing this universe to life. Even if he changed a character, it was still a conscious 180 reflection of what we were more used to seeing. For a long-time DC fan, these changes felt like seeing an Elseworld story brought to life. If you don't know what 'Elseworlds' are when dealing with DC Comics, it's basically DC's excuse to change characters and tell different stories without ruining the canon. Batman v Superman felt like an Elseworlds story, with Superman losing his trademark smile and Batman feeling like a grittier, darker version than usual. Maybe it's because I've read numerous comics with both characters, seen both Donner-era Superman as well as the both cinematic Batman universes, and binged every animated series. Still, I welcomed these changes, especially when it was clear that the entire point of changing them was to rebuild them from the ground up. In most art circles, there's a saying that you have to know the rules before you break the rules. If you want to rebel against something as a filmmaker, writer, or painter, you must understand what you are rebelling against first. Zack Snyder and company clearly knew what they were doing, making direct choices to shift these characters. They were breaking the rules of DC, but doing it for a reason and with genuine knowledge. That's where my love for this movie comes from; it feels like it loves being a comic book movie. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has no problem in being a campy, weird, extremely dark superhero epic. I admire that, especially now when one of the biggest comic book movies of the last year is created by a guy who didn't want it to be anything like a comic book movie. Eight years later, there's nothing like the hate, love, and conversations about this film. In 10 years, I still expect Batman v Superman to still be in the hearts and mouths of many people. It will take another cosmic shift in the pop culture landscape to dethrone this misunderstood masterpiece. What are your thoughts on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice eight years on?

US President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered a series of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas in Yemen. It comes as the Houthis, an Iranian-backed rebel group, said 13 civilians were killed in airstrikes in the capital Sanaa on Saturday evening. And it comes a few days after the group said they would continue attacks on Israeli ships sailing in water off Yemen, in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The Houthi media office said the US strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. President Donald Trump said he ordered the airstrikes promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels stopped attacks along the vital waterway. He said in a social media post: Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate. He said on social media: Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors - as they targeted targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when the ceasefire in Gaza took effect.|2025-03-16|https://www.itv.com/news/2025-03-15/donald-trump-announces-airstrikes-on-houthi-held-areas-in-yemen
Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Wes Streeting suggested hundreds more quangos could be in the firing line after the Prime Minister announced the end of the body overseeing the health service in England. He said: The abolition of NHS England – the world's largest quango – is the beginning, not the end. Patients and staff alike can see the inefficiency and waste in the health service. My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy. NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it was established to cut down on political interference in the NHS – something Mr Streeting described as an act of backside-covering to avoid blame for failures. Sir Keir Starmer delivers a speech announcing the abolition of NHS England / Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visit to Yorkshire / Sir Keir Starmer announced the abolition of NHS England in a surprise move on Thursday (Oli Scarff/PA) But on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the Government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid duplication . In his Sunday Telegraph article, Mr Streeting suggested more was to come, saying new NHS England chair Penny Dash had identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration . The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Mr Streeting, who in January of this year said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS. He told the Health Service Journal he could spend a hell of a lot of time on reorganisation and not make a single difference to the patient interest , saying instead he would focus on trying to eliminate waste and duplication . But in the Sunday Telegraph, he said he had heard former Conservative health ministers bemoan not abolishing NHS England, adding: If we hadn't acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn't have been possible. The Government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline services. But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.|2025-03-16|https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/national/25011411.quangos-firing-line-nhs-england-scrapped---streeting/

The San Francisco 49ers are welcoming back nine-time Pro Bowl fullback Kyle Juszczyk with a two-year, $8 million contract, multiple media outlets reported Saturday morning. Per ESPN, Juszczyk accepted less than what the Pittsburgh Steelers were offering to return to San Francisco. The 49ers released Juszczyk on Tuesday in a move that saved the club more than $2.9 million toward this year's salary cap. Juszczyk was set to make a $4.1 million base salary in 2025 with a $6.5 million cap figure in the final season of a five-year contract. Juszczyk, 33, produced 26 yards and a touchdown on five carries, and he had 200 yards and two TDs on 19 receptions in 2024. In eight seasons with the 49ers, Juszczyk had 60 carries for 212 yards and five touchdowns plus 184 catches for 1,895 yards and 13 scores. The Baltimore Ravens selected Juszczyk in the fourth round of the 2013 NFL Draft out of Harvard, and he spent four seasons with the franchise. Overall, in 189 NFL games (142 starts), he has 67 carries for 237 yards and six touchdowns to go with 281 receptions for 2,664 yards and 18 TDs.|2025-03-16|https://www.wjoxam.com/news/reports-49ers-bring-back-fb-kyle-juszczyk-on-2-year-deal/

Fourth St., Louisville, KY. (Courtesy UL Photographic Archives) [Editor's Note: Elizabeth E. Reilly is a curator at the University of Louisville Photographic Archives, which is one of the treasures of Louisville history and one of the top research resources for Broken Sidewalk. She writes regularly at the UofL Libraries Blog, where this post was originally published. You can peruse the archives' online collections here, but don't blame us for hours of your day gone missing.] When working with historical photographs of a town or city, it's exciting to come across images of recognizable buildings. This is partly why so many people visit the Photographic Archives to search for old photos of their home or street—to compare and contrast the now and then; to get a glimpse into the past of something that is familiar. In fact, looking at old photographs is a great way to learn the history of a city like Louisville, and now websites like Historypin make is very easy to compare old photographs with current-day views according to location. While comparing images of a location from different eras, I often notice significant architectural differences in the buildings. Usually I see a reduction of ornamentation—which coincides with architectural trends through much of the twentieth century; Victorian and Beaux Art architecture is quite ornate, while later styles like Art Deco, International, and Modernism favor more streamlined and functional design. Comparing historic photographs with current day views can reveal the removal of decorative elements such as turrets, parapets, finials, and cresting (Fig. 1). (Figure 2.) 2532 S. Fourth St., Louisville, KY. (Courtesy UL Photographic Archives) Recently I came across an image of a Louisville building from around 1909 that I recognized. I checked the address and indeed the photograph was of a building that I had photographed last year, on South 4th Street, near the UofL Belknap campus (Fig. 2). Comparing the historical photograph with the Google Street View of the same address revealed a peculiar change in the building from 1909 to present day: the removal of the top floor! Close inspection shows that the building pictured in the historical photo is the same building that stands today. The placement of the windows, flat arches over the windows, structure of the façade, and the columns all match in both images. However, the brick building contained a third floor in the 1909 photograph, and now only shows two floors. Perhaps a fire could be the cause of this, but it's a brick building and it's hard to imagine a fire destroying the top floor entirely… Does anyone have any other ideas for why the third floor may have been removed from this building?|2025-03-16|https://brokensidewalk.com/2012/photographic-archives-help-solve-architectural-mysteries/

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

Most brand-new EVs cost a lot of money. In January 2025, Americans spent over $55,000 on average on a fresh-off-the-car-hauler battery electric car. That is $7,000 more than the standard vehicle. But, for millions of drivers, electric vehicles are worth the premium. The cars aren't just tree-hugging transportation alternatives for the environmentally-minded; they're some of the most capable, luxurious cars on the market. They also have some of the best automotive tech. In the world of advanced luxury EVs, one SUV outperforms its competition. It blends nimble and exciting driving dynamics with a well-appointed cabin. Sure, it's expensive. But, it's a vehicle that nearly every owner raves about. To give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Rivian and other authoritative sources. 2024 Rivian R1S driving in action Model Overview Rivian is one of the top names in the EV space, and the 2024 Rivian R1S might just be one of the best all-electric SUVs on the market. Let's find out. The Rivian R1S Blends Rugged Utility With Premium Appeal Rivian built the R1S — its full-size, seven-passenger SUV — from the ground up. The big electric SUV combines genuine off-road capability with the refined touches expected in a premium vehicle. Unlike competitors that merely gesture at adventure readiness, Rivian produced an SUV capable of crawling over rock-strewn trails and parking in front of an upscale restaurant. Inside the cabin, Rivian masterfully balances minimalist design and thoughtful functionality. The roof-spanning panoramic window floods the SUV with sunlight, while tasteful wood, chrome, and leatherette accents highlight its handsome curves. The latest R1S, which received technical updates for 2025, blends the luxurious feel with a more supple ride, better battery performance, and some new color options. Car shoppers who need to be convinced of the R1S's brilliance need not look too far; just ask a Rivian owner. The car company has dominated vehicle ownership satisfaction surveys for several years. 2025 Rivian R1S Specs Powertrain Dual Electric Motor Dual Electric Motor Triple Electric Motor Quad Electric Motor Horsepower 533 HP 533-665 HP 850 HP 1,025 HP Torque 610 LB-FT Up To 829 LB-FT 1,103 LB-FT 1,198 LB-FT Transmission Single-Speed Single-Speed Single-Speed Single-Speed Driveline AWD AWD AWD AWD Battery Capacity 92.5-kWh Battery 108.5-kWh Battery 140.0-kWh Battery 2.5 Seconds 0-60 MPH 4.5 Seconds Up To 3.4 Seconds 2.9 Seconds 2.5 Seconds Range 258 Miles 329-410 Miles 371 Miles TBA in 2025 Fuel Economy (Combined) 79 MPGe 72-78 MPGe 76 MPGe TBA in 2025 Starting Price $75,900 $82,900 $105,900 TBA in 2025 A Modern Take On Adventure-Ready Styling Front three-quarters shot of the 2025 Rivian R1S. The R1S's design language deftly sidesteps the aggressive posturing common among traditional SUVs. Unlike grunting gas guzzlers, the Rivian's squared-off, uninterrupted lines give the car a modern look. The front end is topped off with distinctive oval headlights that create a recognizable silhouette. green 2025 Rivian R1S front driving 2025 Rivian R1S R1S Engine Dual, triple, or quad electric motors Horsepower 533-1,025 HP Torque 610-1,198 LB-FT Driveline AWD 270-410 Miles Towing Capacity 7,700 Pounds 0-60 MPH 4.5-2.5 Seconds But behind the aesthetic, each design detail comes with a well-intentioned purpose. The flush door handles, for example, improve aerodynamics without sacrificing usability. Even the company's infotainment system, which consolidates most of the car's interior controls, gives drivers and passengers a ton of customizable utility. And, like other EVs, the R1S will age like wine. Rivian has continuously sent over-the-air updates to owners that have improved tech usability, charging speeds, and even battery range. Luxury Interior Doesn't Sacrifice Practicality The 2025 Rivian R1S interior. Beyond the premium stitching and interesting wood accents, the R1S's interior features a laundry list of practical touches. Rivian added washable flooring and stain-resistant fabrics to withstand muddy boots and wet gear. Storage solutions abound with thoughtfully placed compartments, including a cavernous front trunk and configurable cargo area. The SUV remains practical in the back, too. Rear passengers enjoy generous head and legroom despite the panoramic glass roof, and the third row can comfortably accommodate adults, a rarity even among three-row SUVs. green 2025 Rivian R1S front driving Related Rivian isn't worried about the anti-EV bent the current administration is taking. Performance That Leaves Gas Cars Eating Dirt Rivian R1S Even in its cheapest form, the R1S is plenty athletic. Dual-motor variants of the SUV have 533 horses and 610 lb-ft of torque, while the standard gas SUV typically has between 200 and 300 horsepower. Rivian's electric powertrain also translates into immediate torque. Flooring the accelerator when the car is stopped will make the R1S sprint to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds. These numbers only get more impressive in the higher-trim models. We're talking about 1,100 horsepower and a 2.9-second zero-to-60 speed, which is faster than most Porsche 911s. Lightning-Fast Acceleration Meets Off-Road Capability Rivian R1S Off-Roading The Rivian remains plenty capable off the roads, too. The car isn't just a sprinter. The SUV features an adjustable air suspension that allows drivers to optimize ground clearance based on terrain demands. The higher the trim level, the more options Rivian owners can tap into. The car comes standard with All-Purpose, All-Terrain, and Snow modes. Higher-level trims introduce Sport, Soft Sand, Rally, Drift, Rock Cawl, and Conserve modes that will standardize the car's throttle response, suspension feel, and steering tightness. In other words, the R1S is extremely versatile. The Suspension Reminds You... It's An Off-Roader At Heart Rivian R1S / Michael Frank TopSpeed One of the most consistent complaints about the R1S is the suspension feel in the city. The large SUV is tuned for off-roading, making the ride harsher than other luxury EVs. For 2025, Rivian softened the suspension to handle owner complaints. The company also lets passengers modify the car's dynamics. If drivers want a more supple ride, they can always adjust the drive modes in the infotainment system. Rivian calls its All-Purpose mode (available in all trim levels) the best balance of comfort, performance, and efficiency . Other common complaints about the SUV are its lack of Apple CarPlay or Android Auto, and its poor reliability track record.

Tech-Driven Cabin Has Features Abound The interior of a 2025 Rivian R1S. The 2025 Rivian R1S doubles down on its tech-forward ethos with a cabin filled with smart, intuitive features. A massive 15.6-inch central touchscreen remains the nerve center of the SUV, running Rivian's custom-built UI. Plus, the company updated the infotainment system to include cheeky sketches that add to the vehicle's sense of whimsy. Gear Guard — a yellow, fuzzy-looking character carrying a camera — pops onto the infotainment when drivers are away from the car to warn potential thieves they're being filmed. Hand-drawn sketches of the R1S also populate all the animations. Behind the wheel, drivers get their own 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster with easy-to-read updates. Factor in Amazon Alexa voice integration, seamless user profiles, and a robust suite of driver-assistance tech, and Rivian's family hauler feels more like a Silicon Valley flagship than a rugged off-roader. Infotainment System That Finds Your Nearest Charger Interior shot of the 2025 Rivian R1S showcasing the dash, steering wheel, and touchscreen system. Rivian's infotainment system isn't just about crisp graphics and fluid animations — it's built to make EV ownership seamless. So, there are no worries about taking the big car on an extended family haul, as smart navigation quickly locates nearby charging stations throughout a long trip. The infotainment system also communicates with fast chargers to validate their availability, charging speeds, and popularity. Drivers can also select how much charge they want when they reach their destination. The Rivian infotainment system will even account for energy-zapping factors, including interior climate controls, weather, and elevation changes. Thoughtful Touches Surround All Passengers Rivian R1S Torch Rivian also built a ton of little Easter eggs in the cabin. Drivers will find a rechargeable flashlight hidden inside their door. The speaker in the center console is easily removed from the car and can work as Bluetooth stereo equipment. Rivian has sent several over-the-air updates that have allowed owners to change charging and vehicle lock chirps to a slate of different sounds. For example, on Halloween 2024, Rivian updated its fleet with the ability to play the Knight Rider TV series theme song. A man charging a Rivian EV at a fast-charging station Related Rivian has opened up its first next-generation charging location with access to for brands. Charging And Range Compete With The Market's Best The 2025 Rivian R1S keeps pace with the EV elite, offering over 400 miles of range in its top-spec cars. Even the lower-tier R1S models use a lithium-iron-phosphate Standard pack that achieves a respectable 270 miles of range. Drivers can boost their battery with roughly 140 miles of range in 20 minutes of fast charging. Standard batteries can achieve a maximum charge rate of 200 kW on a DC fast charger, while top-trim speed charging is 220 kW. With the correct fast-charging conditions, Rivian says drivers will juice their battery from 10 percent to 80 percent in 30–41 minutes. Rivian Is Expanding Its Charging Horizons Photo of Rivian vehicles charging at Joshua Tree Charging Outpost Additionally, the cars can now plug into even more speed-charging stations. Rivian's Adventure Network, the company's proprietary fast charging station, is continuing to grow, giving owners exclusive high-speed chargers. The company said it plans on opening over 3,500 stations across the U.S. Now, the R1S also plays well with Tesla's Supercharger network, giving Rivian owners access to the largest charging company in the US. Tesla says more than 60,000 superchargers line America's highways.|2025-03-16|https://www.topspeed.com/most-well-rounded-luxury-ev-suv/

Wide receiver Mike Evans notched two second-half touchdowns to lead visiting Tampa Bay's 40-17 rout over the offensively inept Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday. The often-injured Evans caught scoring passes of 57 and 35 yards as the Buccaneers outscored the Chargers 27-0 in the second half. Tampa Bay (8-6) remained atop the NFC South with second-place Atlanta (6-7) set to play at Las Vegas on Monday. The back-sliding Falcons swept the Buccaneers this season, however, and hold the first tie-breaker. Tampa Bay won its fourth consecutive game. The Chargers fell to 8-6 but held the sixth wild-card spot in the AFC. They face seventh-seeded Denver on Thursday. Evans finished with 159 yards on nine catches. Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield went 22-for-27 passing for 288 yards and four touchdowns. The punchless LA offense lost one of its calling cards in the second half, too. Quarterback Justin Herbert's streak of 357 consecutive passes without an interception ended in the third quarter as he battled a lingering ankle injury and withering pressure. Herbert, who hadn't been intercepted since Week 2 against Carolina, fell one short of tying Tom Brady for fourth on the all-time list of most starts without a pick. Herbert finished 21-for-33 for 195 yards and two touchdowns as LA was outgained 506-206. Los Angeles led 17-13 at halftime after scoring on its first three drives. The Chargers jumped in front for the first time, 17-10, with 7:12 left until the break when Herbert tossed a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Quentin Johnson. The four-play scoring drive was set up at the Tampa Bay 27 when Tarheeb Still intercepted Mayfield, who has six turnovers in his last two games. Turnovers buoyed the Chargers greatly in the half, as the offense managed just 142 yards. Tampa Bay had taken a 10-7 lead just seconds into the second quarter. Rookie wide receiver Jalen McMillan, who scored twice in a win over Las Vegas last week, exploited a busted coverage for a 26-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield less than four minutes into the game. Chase McLaughlin went 4-for-4 on field goal tries. Rachaad White also had a receiving touchdown for the Buccaneers.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/mike-evans-buccaneers-pummel-chargers/
Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://1070thegame.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
None Posted by Jon Catalyst Grey • February 23, 2025 at 5 p.m. PST • Comments: 16 If you've ever wondered why the Marvel vs. Capcom series plays so differently from the Street Fighter series, it's by design according to the former producer of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, Ryota Niitsuma. While Niitsuma left Capcom in 2020, he's remained a beloved figure in the Fighting Game Community for his exceptional work on Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Tatsunoko vs. Capcom. One of the keys to making Marvel vs. Capcom 3 so successful was doing the opposite, or what wouldn't be possible in the Street Fighter series, which is a tactic he also mentioned the team who made Marvel vs. Capcom 2 employed. When they made Marvel vs. Capcom 2 and 3, basically they're trying to make something that's the opposite of Street Fighter. Street Fighter is very rigid [in its gameplay], everything you do is standard, you have to stick to the basic fighting game rules, Niitsuma said through a translator back in April of 2023. But in Marvel you just do whatever Street Fighter can't do, and that's a key to success, Niitsuma stated. This is backed up further by another former Capcom developer, Seth Killian, who was asked in 2010 about what makes a Marvel vs. Capcom game. Obviously it's things like super jumps and a large character cast and the tagging and all that, but for me I think it came down to — it sounds a bit silly, but this is exactly what we agreed — at the beginning it just wasn't insane enough, said Killian. One of the gauges of insanity is how much crap there is on the screen. It doesn't have to be constant crap on the screen at all times, but if you are playing well, or you want to generate a giant storm of crap, if you are able to do that, then — when people pass by and say, 'I have no idea what's happening there' then you've nailed it, said Seth. You can start it slow and play it like any other Street Fighter game, but the Marvel games have a level of insanity just waiting there underneath. So when you start becoming a little more virtuoso, there's just a screen of nuttiness, Seth Killian concluded. It's pretty clear from how Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 turned out that the developers of that game were on the same page, as it received extremely high praise from the Fighting Game Community. As such, when it comes to discussing a new sequel, especially since signs are pointing to an increasing possibility of a new entry to the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise, it's going to be important for the new team to keep some of the old gameplay ideas and approaches intact. Zany, over the top gameplay you can't find in the Street Fighter franchise with a lot of effects and many things happening at once on screen seems like it should be important for the developers to keep intact this time around as well. Also, delivering a large roster and likely 3v3 gameplay seems like other boxes the developers need to check as well. What things do you feel are important to the heart of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise? Feel free to sound off in the comments below.|2025-03-16|https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/feb/23/marvel-capcom-producer-street-fighter/
HYDERABAD: Upset over derogatory online posts about him and his family members, Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy on Saturday warned individuals posing as journalists and posting offensive and abusive content about public representatives that they would be stripped and paraded in public . Replying to queries raised by members in the assembly on the motion of thanks to the governor's address, he said a law could be passed to stop vicious campaigns online. He said the time had come to define who is a journalist . Let media organisations, their associations, I&PR and other authorised agencies define a journalist, list out their names and give them to govt. They can be exempted. Others will be treated as criminals and action will be taken as per law, he added. If you cross line, results can be dire: Revanth to KCR Even as BRS boycotted his speech, Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy lashed out at the opposition party, blaming it for the abusive posts against his family. They (BRS) condemned the arrest of two women journalists recently, who had posted derogatory and abusive language about my family members and me. I have been patient, but how long should I be tolerant when bad language has been used in social media posts against the women in my family? he asked. The CM said that his blood is boiling over the language used against his family's women members, and asked if BRS netas would keep quiet if abusive words were used for their mothers, sisters and wives. I will have them (people who put up such posts) stripped and paraded because they have no right to comment on women in my family, a visibly angry Revanth said. Using the choicest abuses in Telugu, a farmer was heard saying in a video on a local YouTube news channel that he would beat up Revanth's family members and Congress functionaries for failing to keep their election promises. A case was registered on March 10, and two women running the YouTube channel were arrested on March 12. Police later accused the women of shooting the video inside BRS office. They (BRS) brought paid artists to their party office, recorded it and posted it on social media. Now, they are upset because police cases have been registered against the two women, Revanth said. Addressing opposition leader & ex-CM K Chandrasekhar Rao, Revanth said: Do not be under the impression that you can derive political mileage by hurting us psychologically. If you cross the line, the consequences will be dire. I am being tolerant and stopping the youth, or else they would hit the roads, strip you all before beating you black and blue.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/those-who-post-abusive-content-will-be-stripped-paraded-in-public-revanth-reddy/articleshow/119059673.cms
BOISE, Idaho - The audio of a 911 call made on the day four University of Idaho students were stabbed to death reveals confusion as the callers realized at least one of the students was not waking up. In the audio released Friday, a woman called 911 at 11:55 a.m. on Nov. 13, 2022. She sounded very upset while saying, Something happened in our house. General view of the house at 1122 King Road, Moscow, Idaho, on Sunday, May 21, 2023. The home is boarded up following the murder of four students here in November last year. (Derek Shook for Fox News Digital) She broke down crying while giving the address. At that point another woman took the phone. One of the roommates who's passed out and she was drunk last night and she's not waking up, the second woman told a dispatcher. Oh, and they saw some man in their house last night. The initial caller came back on the line, asking if she could tell the dispatcher what happened and saying, At 4 a.m... The dispatcher cut her off, saying she needed to know what was going on at that time and if someone was passed out. The woman said they would go check and then said the student was still passed out and not waking up. The dispatcher told them help was on the way. The caller or callers at that point sounded like they may have been crying and breathing heavily while telling the dispatcher that the person who was not breathing was 20 years old. A male voice was then heard on the line saying hello and the dispatcher asked them to stop passing the phone around. The male also told the dispatcher that the woman was not breathing. The call ended shortly afterward when police arrived. Bryan Kohberger is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves. The students were killed in the early morning at a rental home near their campus in Moscow, Idaho. A judge previously entered a not-guilty plea on Kohberger's behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted. Kohberger's trial is scheduled to begin Aug. 11 and expected to last more than three months.|2025-03-16|https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/911-idaho-student-murders-case

Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning The airstrikes come days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. This image provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen March 15, 2025 Credit: U.S. Navy via AP WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in Sanaa and in the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

With more than a third of Colorado — some 24 million acres — preserved as public land, the news last week of mass firings in some of the agencies tasked with managing those lands has prompted concerns about the capacity of remaining employees to regulate use and prevent deadly wildfires. Mikayla Moors, 27, was nine months into her permanent position as a forestry technician with the U.S. Forest Service based in Fort Collins when she got the news her job was cut. In her role, she traveled throughout the region to assist understaffed districts in Colorado, South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. She recorded data in the field, served as an extra set of eyes for sensitive species and assisted in forest regeneration surveys. Moors previously spent two summers with the National Park Service at Rocky Mountain National Park and then worked as an intern for two winters with the Rocky Mountain Conservancy, the park's philanthropic partner. She finally got her foot in the door with a permanent position as a forestry technician — something she says is hard to achieve — and is now unemployed. I put in my work as a dedicated, passionate civil servant, caring for the land and serving the people, Moors said. I just want to try and find the place where I belong and where I can do my best work and because I'm so early in my career, I was still looking for that. Moors was one of more than 90 U.S. Forest Service employees who received termination notices in Colorado last Friday, part of a purge of 3,400 workers nationwide in the Forest Service, according to a statement by Gov. Jared Polis. The cuts have also targeted at least 2,300 employees from various agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior including the National Park Service, according to Reuters. Other published reports put the number of jobs cut in Colorado as high as 150. Originally, more than 5,000 seasonal jobs at national parks were also on the chopping block, but The Associated Press reported Feb. 20 that the National Park Service confirmed it would reinstate those jobs. A day later the NPS said it would employee a total of 7,700 seasonal employees, higher than the three-year average of 6,350. About 50 permanent jobs had also been reinstated, the service said. The Park Service has about 20,000 employees. The directive to cut the U.S. Forest Service jobs came from an executive order signed by President Donald Trump in his first days in office, aiming to significantly reduce the size of government. Most cuts targeted workers who were, like Moors, in a probationary period, either as new employees or after moving to new positions. On Feb. 13, Moors received an email that said she was being fired. Part of the emailed memo read: The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest. The same sentence has been widely reported in the termination emails sent to other federal workers nationwide. Moors received exceeds expectations on all categories in a recent performance report she shared with The Gazette. It's a lot of time that we spend dedicating ourselves to working on furthering our careers for the mission of the agencies we choose to work for, Moors said. I can't imagine doing any other kind of work. It is just so fulfilling, and it's really my life's mission to serve others. Facing uncertainty Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, one of four in Colorado, has been making do with less for years as crews monitor the steep, deep canyon gouged by the Gunnison River in the western part of the state, with its extreme vistas. The Valentine's Day layoffs just cut a significant chunk of the park's staff, said Sheridan Steele, an executive council member for the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks, an advocacy group founded by National Park Service retirees. Steele was previously Black Canyon's deputy superintendent. That, of course, has all kinds of ramifications, Steele said. This is in the face of tremendous increases in visitation since COVID and a decline in budget anyway … it's putting people in a bad spot. Steele said there are 74 total permanent staff member positions at Black Canyon, 14 of which were already vacant and could not be filled before the federal layoffs. The National Park Service, like all other federal agencies, has had a freeze on new hires with few exceptions since Jan. 20. The probationary layoffs numbered 10, and three Black Canyon staff took the fork in the road buyout referring to emails sent to federal employees offering a deferred resignation dated for September of this year. The losses bring the total number of vacancies to 27, leaving just 47 full-time employees to monitor the 30,000-acre park. Steele said the immediate impacts in the park could be longer entrance lines, overflowing bathrooms and limitations on campgrounds. Diminished staff could also indirectly dampen tourism numbers, an economic driver for the area, he said. There (would) be some economic impact to the surrounding community. Black Canyon depends on the local community for the motels, the restaurants, souvenir shops and gas stations, Steele said. A question of safety Steele said he was also concerned about the potential impacts of lower staffing numbers on safety in the park system. The park, like many rugged parts of the state's federal land system, is a draw for extreme outdooring. The park's sheer canyon walls and whitewater rapids both attract thrill-seekers, sometimes resulting in rescue operations or even fatalities. The park has seen 43 reported public safety incidents since 1988, some involving deaths and all requiring some intervention by park staff. Those numbers are eclipsed many times over by Rocky Mountain National Park, the most visited in the state. Steele also served as the deputy superintendent of that park during in his career. Steele said the number of visitors has gone up well over 50% since 2012, while the number of staff has gone down around 16% before any federal layoffs. With further decreases in staffing anticipated, Steele thinks safety in Colorado's signature park is at risk. In a place like Rocky Mountain, where we had 40 to 60 major rescues a year, you've got to have trained staff ready to make those rescues or meet the emergency medical needs, Steele said. If you have fewer staff with that expertise, response times will be slower, or could (take) longer to get help, and that would be, in some cases, really unfortunate. When asked if a decrease in staff or a lack of seasonal workers could cause visitor deaths, Steele said it would be hard to prove a direct cause but thinks it could be a contributing factor. Because of a lack of staffing, Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument some 35 miles from Colorado Springs announced it will now be closed Mondays and Tuesdays. The Facebook announcement had garnered more than 46,000 reactions and more than 10,000 comments in less than 24 hours. Stretched thin Understaffing in Colorado public lands is not new. Last fall, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Forest Service, announced a hiring freeze on seasonal employees outside of firefighting due to ongoing budget constraints. The agency has also increasingly allocated its finite resources to fighting wildfires. Bill Kight, a retired public affairs officer for the White River National Forest, said that the Forest Service has been cutting positions and equipment for a decade. Over the last 10 years, the budget has been decreasing instead of increasing, he said. Before her dismissal, Moors filled in around the region in places the Forest Service was understaffed. She said that the Forest Service was chronically understaffed and underpaid, with starter and seasonal wages near the poverty level. I was living on poverty wages my entire career just to get that one position where maybe I can make a little more and live semi-comfortably still serving the people, Moors said. A recent statement from the USDA said that Secretary Brooke Rollins supported the firing of probationary, non-firefighting employees in the mass layoff this month, but some Coloradans close to the issue say the cuts put already decreased firefighting capacity in danger. I can't see how the number of people being dismissed is not going to affect the fire season, said Kight. Featured Local Savings While firefighters were meant to be exempt from the cuts, most Forest Service and National Park Service employees contribute to fire prevention and mitigation, said Kight. Non-firefighters also monitor for fires and educate the public on safe practices, he said. Wildland fire response is a collaborative effort shared by a variety of entities, from tiny local fire districts to massive federal agencies. In Western states especially, the feds play a crucial role. While state agencies have invested heavily in their own wildfire crews, they say the federal agencies are critical partners. Before the layoffs, Brad White, chief of Grand Fire Protection District No. 1 in Grand County, already had concerns about his federal partners in firefighting efforts. Seasonal hiring is an important part of the federal firefighting effort each year, with hiring and training typically a months-long process ending in mid-spring. The last time White heard from local Forest Service officials, he said, he seasonal hiring process had not yet begun for 2025. While large fires have broken out across public lands, the responding ability of federal firefighters and equipment is also relied upon in major incidents beyond those lands to provide mutual aid to state and local partners. Wildfires that require an interagency response have been an increasingly grave concern in Colorado in recent decades. Four of the five largest wildfires in the state's history occurred in the period between 2018 and 2020, according to state figures. White said no one was answering the phones at his neighboring ranger district in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests as of Thursday. There's a lot of questions, and we don't know what this fire season is going to look like or how much help we're going to have, he said Grand County used to have three Forest Service fire engines and one for the National Park Service in the area, according to White. Now, the federal firefighters have one engine to share among zones, a strategy that White worries may spread resources too thin. The way fire danger works is not that one county has fire danger, and the rest are low, he said. Typically, you've got whole regions that are experiencing heat and wind. Taking up the slack Dan Williams, a Teller County commissioner, has some of the same concerns about his county, which includes a large percentage of federal land including the Pike-San Isabel National Forest. He also has not heard from federal officials since the layoffs. Let's just say there's a big fire out west of us in California, he said. We do the right thing and send our people, our equipment and our airplanes, and then we look to our left or right and we get a fire, and we find out that not only has (the federal government) not sent firefighters, but there's also a significantly reduced workforce here. White and Williams said they expected state and local firefighting and prevention resources to attempt to take up the slack this year. The day after Labor Day in 2024, volunteers with a local fire protection district canvassed part of national forest land in rural Teller County looking for improperly doused campfires. They found 58, according to Williams. We're not going to let the forest catch on fire, he said. Now, in light of layoffs and freezes on some federal funding related to mitigation work, Williams fears the community may come to rely more on piecemeal efforts. 'What do we do?' is really the question, he said. Do we expect money to come from somewhere else, or are we expected to shoulder the burden? Because everyone is facing cuts right now. All Forest Service employees work fire adjacent in some way, Moors said. Whether that's educating people and ensuring campfire safety, working on preventing wildfires in the first place, on all 193 million acres of national forest and grasslands, (those employees) are being called to the front lines to fight the fire when it happens. Moors said her house was saved last summer by wildland firefighters and fellow Forest Service colleagues. I wonder if the people who saved my house still have a job, Moors said. 'Reckless endangerment' The Trump-mandated layoffs have seen some pushback by Colorado elected officials. On Friday, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet introduced several amendments to the Senate fiscal year 2025 budget resolution. One includes reinstating roughly 5,500 recently fired National Park Service, Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Land Management employees. Senate Republicans have made it clear they are willing to turn their backs on hard-working Americans in order to cut taxes for the wealthiest in this country, stated Bennet in a news release Friday. In a statement released Feb. 14, Gov. Jared Polis called the firings reckless endangerment. However, Republican U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, who represents the El Paso County-based 5th Congressional District, said he has faith that the executive mandates are clearing the way for a more efficient and effective government. President Trump is following through on his commitment to root out waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government. While the President's process is in its early stages, I am closely monitoring the impacts to Coloradans, he said in an emailed statement to The Gazette. Teller County's Williams said he was joining the National Association of Counties in Washington in a few weeks to lobby for federal staffing and funding for public lands. He said that beyond the layoffs, millions in funding for wildfire mitigation projects in his county are also at stake. He said that organic material previously collected for pile burns, a standard fire mitigation measure, cannot sit idle in the Pike-San Isabel National Forest. Those piles of ever increasingly dry wood just become fire risk to the community, he said. Legal challenges to the layoffs and firings have had mixed results so far, ranging from temporary stays to outright denials. A lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the National Treasury Employees Union and others on Feb. 12 challenged multiple executive actions, including the directive to fire hundreds of thousands of new federal workers. The lawsuit, according to a statement released by NTEU, asked the judge to declare that the mass firing of probationary and other employees and the deferred resignation program, collectively, are unlawful. The suit was denied. NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said in a statement that federal employees will get their day in court. The public may not feel the pain immediately, but come spring and summer, it will be chaos, Rocky Mountain National Park tour guide Rod Strand predicts. These aren't just jobs; they're callings. And now, those who have dedicated their lives to protecting and educating the public about our national treasures are being tossed aside under the guise of 'performance issues.' It's an insult, and it's a loss that will be deeply felt — by the staff, by visitors, and by the communities that depend on these parks.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/colorado-state-parks/federal-layoffs-could-impact-firefighting-recreation-on-colorado-public-lands/article_a2556c86-f088-11ef-96de-bf8cccb017c3.html
LAWRENCE, Kan. (KCTV) - Near hurricane-force winds tested the mettle of area firefighters as they battled a 200+ acre wildfire near Clinton Lake. Lawrence-Douglas County Fire Medical announced on Saturday afternoon, March 15, that a grass fire that started on Friday night has been brought under control. Firefighters from multiple agencies were called to battle several wildfires that night, including one east of Stull. The Stull fire burned more than 200 acres near N. 1600 and E. 400 Rd. Residents had been asked to evacuate but were given the all-clear after about 2 hours. No buildings were lost or injuries reported as a result. Firefighters said they battled near hurricane-force winds during the treacherous fire. Most of the land was managed by the Corps of Engineers and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. Both agencies continue to monitor the area, as trees are expected to continue to smolder over the next few days. These conditions and the large fires created challenges for firefighters and first responders, but the teamwork and coordination helped us protect lives and property amid the threat of these fires, said John Mathis, interim fire chief for Douglas County Consolidated Fire District No. 1. County officials noted that the Kansas State Fire Marshal has begun a preliminary investigation into the fire's cause. No further information has been released.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/200-acres-burn-near-clinton-lakes-northwestern-bank-gale-force-winds/
The dueling tariffs between Canada and the United States are a concern to South Dakota because of its proximity to the northern country, but farmer and ranchers have faith in President Donald Trump's decisions, new South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said on Newsmax Saturday. I think the farmers and ranchers in South Dakota recognize that Donald Trump is a New York real estate guy, and he understands the art of the negotiation, the Republican governor, who took office after former Gov. Kristi Noem became the Homeland Security Secretary under Trump, told Newsmax's Saturday Agenda. South Dakota is very dramatically an agricultural state, Rhoden added, and it has a good working relationship with the Trump administration. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Paul Skenes is the Opening Day starter for the Pittsburgh Pirates, a first-time distinction for the 2024 National League Rookie of the Year and All-Star Game starter. Manager Derek Shelton did have other options, but he said there was one obvious choice. Well, he's really good, a smiling Shelton said of Skenes. I think he deserves it from what he did last year, the way he's performed. I think we have a really good rotation with some other guys who can do it. Mitch (Keller) has done it in the past and has done a really good job. Just felt like Paul was the best choice. The Pirates shared a video of the moment Shelton informed Skenes he would be the Opening Day starter. Skenes, 22, was among the top three in NL Cy Young voting at the end of last season, posting a record of 11-3 with a 1.96 ERA and 170 strikeouts in 133 innings. He'll take the ball March 27 at Miami, facing the Marlins and 2022 NL Cy Young winner Sandy Alcantara.|2025-03-16|https://www.wjoxam.com/news/pirates-pick-obvious-first-time-opening-day-starter/

Smaller VAT hike 'will still hit poor' Economic justice groups say even a bigger zero-rated basket for food items will not help 16 March 2025 - 00:00 Khulekani Magubane Financial reporter A one percentage point VAT hike over the next two years will eat into social grants that poor households depend on, say economic justice groups, warning that even the expansion of the zero-rated basket to include more goods — as announced in the budget on Wednesday — is not good news for those reliant on social welfare. ..

For decades, thousands of Canadian seniors who've flocked south to escape winter with our friendly neighbours have enjoyed the title of 'Snowbird.' Now, they'll simply be 'aliens,' in the eyes of U.S. President Donald Trump's rapidly changing — and hostile — government. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Amid a growing trade war between Canada and the U.S., details are emerging about new rules for snowbirds and other Canadians staying more than 30 days in America. Despite conflicting information from official sources, it appears snowbirds will now have to register with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration services, after a January executive order from Trump. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Here's what we know so far: On inauguration day, Trump signed the Protecting the American People Against Invasion order, as part of a crackdown on illegal immigration. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Many of these aliens unlawfully within the United States present significant threats to national security and public safety, committing vile and heinous acts against innocent Americans, the order reads. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW New alien registration requirements will go into effect April 11, according to a draft of the rule published this week in the U.S. federal registry, the official journal of the American government. It will require all aliens over 14 staying in the country for more than 30 days to register, and be fingerprinted. Parents must register their children under 14. Failure to do this could result in a fine of up to $5,000 or up to six months in prison. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security told the Star last week that Canadian citizens are 'registered' when they are inspected and admitted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at U.S. ports of entry. Canadians who were lawfully admitted into the United States as non-immigrant visitors are not required to be further registered. However, a different spokesperson said in an email after the draft rule was published that certain Canadians planning to visit the United States for longer than 30 days will be required to complete an alien registration form. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW It is important to note that this rule will not affect Canadian visitors staying for less than 30 days, nor will it impact Canadian members of the NEXUS program or those travelling under the Visa Waiver Program, as these travelers (sic) have already submitted their biometric identification as part of those programs, they added. The Department of Homeland Security fully supports this rule, which aligns with the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts to enhance the safety and security of the United States. The spokesperson directed all other followup questions to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond to followup questions by deadline. Unregistered aliens include Canadian visitors who entered the United States at land ports of entry and were not issued evidence of registration, the draft rule on the registry reads. But it appears at the moment Canadians don't need to be fingerprinted. Stuart Friedman, a U.S. and Canadian immigration lawyer working in the border cities of Southfield, Mich., and Windsor told the Star that's his understanding, despite the harsh language in President Trump's executive order. There are several forms that already qualify a person as being registered, including an I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, per the new rules. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Canadian travellers typically get this form when they cross by air or sea, but not by land. If travellers don't have one or another form of registration, they're considered unregistered, and need to fill out a new form called the G-325R. To get that form, travellers must register at https://my.uscis.gov/. Friedman noted that people need to carry the registration document with them at all times and update the information within ten days of an address change, or face fines or possible jail time. I doubt incarceration will be sought against Canadians, but fines might be a different issue, he said. The 'good news' is that there is no fee (for the form) and it can all be done online. Rudy Buttignol, president of the Canadian Association of Retired Persons (CARP), said he's heard from members across the country who are coming back from the U.S. early, cancelling trips or rethinking next year's plans. It's the uncertainty that's really unnerving people and disturbing them, he said, citing contrary reports about fingerprinting. The ramblings from the president seem to be so random and idiosyncratic that people don't know from day-to-day if something is going to change. ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW Even seniors who were planning short visits of less than 30 days, says Buttinol, are now nervous — and angry — about border crossings. It just seems mean-spirited.

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://wgy.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
https://park.takamiyagarden.com/ Japanese Gardens in Fukuoka City, 福岡市内にある日本庭園 Scattered throughout Fukuoka's city and residential areas, you'll find beautiful Japanese gardens that can be visited casually. Each garden, adorned with ponds, stones, trees, and flowers, is designed to highlight different viewing spots where it appears the most beautiful, offering a remarkable spectacle for each season. Whether you're leisurely strolling to find these spots or quietly sitting and gazing at the garden, it is a soothing experience. Japanese Gardens in Fukuoka City, 福岡市内にある日本庭園 Tips! Japanese gardens are classified by their design and methods of appreciation. There are mainly three types; it's handy to know this: 1. Pond Garden (Chisen) Many of the gardens in Japan are Chisen , or Pond Gardens, designed around a central pond. There are gardens enjoyed by boat and strolling gardens where you can walk around. 2. Dry Landscape Garden (Karesansui) These gardens express ponds or seas through sand and stones, without using water. Such gardens are commonly found within temple grounds. 3. Hill and Pond Garden (Chikuzan Rinsen) These gardens organically connect various elements such as teahouses, forests, and fields. Five Representative Gardens in Fukuoka City Ohori Park Japanese Garden Located within the popular Ohori Park, an oasis for citizens, the Ohori Park Japanese Garden opened in 1984 to celebrate the park's 50th anniversary. This garden, designed in the hill and pond strolling style, was crafted by Kinsaku Nakane, a renowned Japanese landscape artist who also designed gardens for the Adachi Museum of Art and Boston Museum of Fine Arts. With its extensive area of about 1.2ha, the garden, surrounded by white plaster walls and trees, offers numerous attractions. The garden is designed around a large pond with a backdrop of artificial hills. It features three different waterfalls, a dry landscape garden, and a teahouse in sukiya style. It is arranged for visitors to stroll around through garden paths. As it's located right in the city, you should definitely visit it while walking in Ohori Park.

Tanaka, a tea lover, hired famous sukiya craftsmen from Kyoto and collected materials to build a formal teahouse Shofuan and a spacious hall in 1952. These were preserved and renovated to open as Shofuen to the public in 2007. The garden includes a tea-ceremony ground, depicting Mount Fuji and Suruga Bay, an Iroha maple over 100 years old, and Ayabe stone lanterns.

Zenemon, also known by his elegant pseudonym Rakusui , enjoyed tea ceremonies in his teahouse named Rakusuian . After the war, the location was used as an inn, but it reopened as Rakusuien in 1995. The first thing you will notice is the Hakata Wall at the entrance, which originated from burnt stones and tiles hardened with clay during Toyotomi Hideyoshi's post-war reconstruction of Hakata. The Japanese garden is a pond-stroll style, featuring a waterfall lined with natural stones and nature that changes with the seasons. In one corner of the garden, there is a suikinkutsu, a water cave. It is designed for enjoying the echoing sound of dripping water, made in a hollow under a water basin for hand-cleansing. If you listen closely, you can hear a faint sound. If Rakusuian, the replica of Zenemon's teahouse, is not in use for a tea ceremony, you can enjoy matcha tea with a sweet for ¥500.

The 71-year-old admitted to police he was aware she was in the trap for about two hours but left her meowing in pain , RSPCA South Australia said in a statement on Sunday.

(HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) A man used brickwork next to his fence to funnel his neighbour's cat into a steel-jaw trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) After the injured cat was freed, an RSPCA inspector and police attended the man's property to find the steel-jaw trap had been reset. It had been set next to a hole in a fence and surrounded by brickwork, funnelling cats entering through the hole to walk directly into the trap. These are barbaric devices that inflict terrible injuries and cause enormous suffering, RSPCA SA Chief Inspector Andrew Baker said. It's tragic to think that some animals could become trapped and never found, leaving them to die in agony. One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) Mr Baker hoped the prosecution of the man, convicted of animal cruelty and setting a steel-jaw trap, would deter others from using them. From RSPCA's perspective, there's no good reason to own a steel-jaw trap, he said. We encourage anyone who has one to turn it into scrap metal so that there is no possibility of it ever falling into the hands of a person who wants to harm animals. According to the RSPCA, the man was placed on a six-month good behaviour bond on Friday and ordered to pay Lunar's vet costs, exceeding $4000.

California homeowners are facing a 22% increase in insurance premiums if State Farm, the state's largest single insurer with roughly 1 million home insurance policies in California, can justify it with data in a public hearing next month, California's top insurance regulator said Friday, reports the Los Angeles Times. State Farm claims it is committed to its California customers and aims to restore financial stability. I expect both State Farm and its parent company to meet their responsibilities and not shift the burden entirely onto their customers, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. The facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Shani Daily Horoscope March 16, 2025: Today's Zodiac Sign Predictions & Shani Chalisa Remedies / TOI TOI Shani, i.e. Saturn, is the planet of our karmas. It teaches us valuable lessons by encouraging us to learn from our mistakes. Saturn wants us to grow, evolve, and continuously improve as we move forward in our life journey. It also wants us to introspect about our actions to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Currently, Saturn is transiting into the sign of Aquarius, and from this position, it will be casting its influence on the lives of all zodiac signs. Let us discover Saturn's cosmic guidelines for you today and how you can seek his blessings in this Daily Shani Horoscope. Shani Horoscope Today for Aries Today, you should enjoy leisure activities, although you must stay alert about your financial situation, according to Saturn. The positive feeling of generosity can exist alongside careful money lending because some individuals may fail to return borrowed funds. Today, Saturn teaches you to strike a proper equilibrium between giving and taking care of your financial well-being. You should concentrate on developing good financial behaviours while staying away from impulse purchases. Finding your own definition of financial discipline will help you generate stability as you embrace the present moment. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Do Surya Namaskar every morning to strengthen Sun, which reduces Shani's adverse effects. Shani Horoscope Today for Taurus Household responsibilities will probably transform in unpredictable ways throughout this day, so maintain both patience and wise judgment. According to Saturn's wisdom, you should listen to experienced elders before making significant decisions. Their experience provides you with valuable directions when facing uncertain situations. Making steady and thoughtful decisions helps people handle the unpredictable aspects of modern life. Pay attention to long-lasting outcomes by resisting quick adjustments during this period. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Fast on Saturdays to honor Shani and reduce negative effects. Shani Horoscope Today for Gemini Love will surprise you today by generating unexpected feelings. Saturn guides you toward handling fresh romantic experiences with both enthusiasm and safety measures. True connection between people develops through the combination of patient development and genuine commitment. Before moving forward in relationships, you should dedicate time to understanding your true relationship needs. Examine previous experiences to identify repeating habits you need to eliminate, along with the principles you intend to uphold. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Wear black shoes and keep them clean and polished. Shani Horoscope Today for Cancer The day brings financial opportunities particularly suitable for business owners. Saturn encourages you to go beyond short-term achievements even though you can celebrate this moment. The path to financial stability requires disciplined choices which presents your daily task to create decisions that build long-term prosperity. Think twice before spending your money on short-lived pleasures because you should investigate ways to reinvest into secure future investments. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Carry or wear a Shani Yantra for protection. Shani Horoscope Today for Leo A journey is approaching with new experiences and opportunities, yet Saturn urges you to assess your expenses before making any commitments. Travel offers people enrichment, but financial responsibility remains essential in today's world. Examine if the upcoming travel will advance your future objectives or function as a spontaneous withdrawal from reality. The lessons of Saturn about responsibility demand that you make choices that strengthen stability rather than waste your financial resources. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Assist the elderly and handicapped, especially on Saturdays. Shani Horoscope Today for Virgo Saturn provides you with mental clarity right now, so you should learn to trust your decision-making abilities and intelligence. Your instincts now match your logical assessment when it comes to important life decisions, including career choices and financial and personal commitments. The key to success today lies in maintaining patience while dismissing all doubting thoughts about your decisions. Successful people today embrace their choices by taking full responsibility for them while refusing to waver from their decisions. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Practice honesty and integrity in all dealings. Shani Horoscope Today for Libra Today, Saturn demands that you maintain care when handling financial and legal responsibilities. Any attempt to break the rules or take shortcuts might result in severe, unwanted problems. The combination of honesty and structure will create stronger results for your future. Make all financial decisions with extreme precision by examining details thoroughly and seeking expert advice to confirm everything upholds ethical standards. Saturn teaches discipline through its wisdom, and you can strengthen stability by making ethical decisions with careful planning. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Regularly read scriptures related to Saturn. Shani Horoscope Today for Scorpio The present energy prompts you to protect your relationship from external interference. The influence of Saturn makes you understand patience alongside trust, so you must prevent external influences from distorting your decisions. Your situation may lead others to develop incorrect assumptions about it. Direct communication with your partner and your inner wisdom should be your guide before you react. Determine if outside opinions help or create obstacles for your relationship. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Plant and nurture Peepal trees and never harm them. Shani Horoscope Today for Sagittarius According to Saturn's teachings, the recognition you have earned today requires you to accept the rewards with dignity. You should accept praise from your colleagues and superiors, yet genuine achievement results from sustained efforts and commitment rather than mere recognition. Your current success should drive you to establish better professional objectives along with skill development. The planet Saturn only grants its rewards to those who maintain discipline; thus, you should concentrate on long-term stability rather than temporary recognition. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Perform Tailabhishekam (oil bath) to Shani deity. Shani Horoscope Today for Capricorn Unexpected encounters with past acquaintances will reveal hidden emotions which may surface today. The enlightenment from Saturn shows you how to deal with this matter through steady and balanced conduct. Accept all emotions that emerge from this encounter by maintaining a calm attitude and being patient. Your current situation determines the space which past experiences will occupy. Look back on this encounter to determine its purpose for your growth because it might help you achieve closure or forgiveness or remind you of your current achievements. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Refrain from consuming alcohol and non-vegetarian food on Saturdays. Shani Horoscope Today for Aquarius The high level of your energy today demands meaningful direction from Saturn. Positive thinking needs structure and discipline to achieve real success. You should concentrate on achieving a goal that demands consistent effort by taking specific steps towards completion. According to Saturn, true growth emerges only through steady dedication, even though enthusiasm brings significant power. Consider which areas require consolidation because you need to focus your passion on building enduring achievements. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Wear an iron ring made from a horse's shoe on your middle finger. Shani Horoscope Today for Pisces The lesson from Saturn for today concerns developing patience during leadership roles. Your ideas hold worth yet attempting to impose them on others might trigger opposition. Diplomacy, together with understanding, should lead your actions. Leaders should display inner self-assurance instead of using controlling methods in their professional roles and personal relationships. A single appropriately chosen word delivers stronger results than issuing a loud command. Shani Chalisa Remedy: Offer food grains to crows, as they are considered representatives of Shani.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/astrology/horoscope/shani-daily-horoscope-march-16-2025-todays-zodiac-sign-predictions-shani-chalisa-remedies/articleshow/119036228.cms

MUMBAI: Bombay high court has allowed a woman's plea for medical termination of her over-35-week pregnancy by a procedure for stopping the heartbeat of the fetus. The woman (26) learned about the fetal anomaly last month. A J J Hospital medical board report unanimously recommended termination of the pregnancy, observing the fetus suffers from a congenital macrocephaly (abnormally large head) with a brain defect. There is a possibility of the fetus being live-born requiring NICU stay. It opined the baby is likely to have drug-resistant seizures, developmental delay, intellectual deficits, severe weakness, gait disturbances, poor vision making the baby incompatible with life . The woman moved HC urging permission for the procedure as per the Centre's Aug 2018 guidance note to medical boards with respect to methods of termination beyond 20 weeks of gestation. Clause allows stopping of fetus' heartbeat: Woman's lawyer Conscious of the right of the petitioner to reproductive freedom, her autonomy over her body and her right to choice, medical condition of the petitioner and having considered the findings and opinion of the medical board, the court permitted the woman to medically terminate her pregnancy. ...In view of the guidance note issued by the Union of India and adopted by the State of Maharashtra, we permit Dr... to perform the MTP procedure as contemplated under Clause V (c) of the guidance note, if, in the opinion of the medical practitioner, it is so required... Justices Revati Mohite Dere and Neela Gokhale directed this past Tuesday. The woman's advocate, Meenaz Kakalia, referred to Clause V (c) in the guidance note which, in cases of pregnancies over 24 weeks gestation, provides for stopping of fetal heartbeat (by ultrasound-guided procedure) to avoid the fetus being delivered alive. She said state govt has also adopted Centre's guidelines and has provided for stopping the fetus's heartbeat in such situations.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fetal-anomaly-detected-late-bombay-hc-allows-26-year-old-to-end-pregnancy-at-35-weeks/articleshow/119059127.cms
The Atlanta Falcons' standoff with Kirk Cousins continues even as both sides pass an important deadline. Cousins was due a $10 million roster bonus for the 2026 season if he was on the roster past 4 p.m. EST on Saturday. Many believed the bonus was a deadline for Cousins to be released or traded. With Michael Penix Jr. ready to start next season, it felt like it made sense for the Falcons to move on. But the saga came to a surprising end – even though a final resolution could be coming in the final months. Falcons Hold Onto Kirk Cousins Through Saturday Deadline According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, the Falcons will not trade or release Cousins before his 2026 roster bonus becomes guaranteed on Saturday afternoon. The decision isn't a surprise if you've followed general manager Terry Fontenot's plan to keep Cousins as a backup next season. But NFL Network's Mike Garafolo provided the twist revealing the bonus was subject to offset language. Garafolo pointed out that this means the team that is paying him next year will pick up Atlanta's portion for part or all of the guarantee. If Cousins is traded in the future, the Falcons may not be responsible for the bonus, but that's where things become complicated. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero explained that Cousins made $62.5 million in the first year of his contract and is due $27.5 million in 2025. With the $10 million roster bonus, Cousins will have made the $100 million that was guaranteed in the contract. This reveals the reason why the Falcons didn't release Cousins. Cutting him with a pre-June 1 designation wasn't a possibility since it increased his 2025 cap hit from $40 million to $65 million. Cutting him with a post-June 1 designation would clear $32.5 million in cap space for 2026, but Atlanta would still be on the hook for the $10 million bonus. At this point, the best scenario is to hold for a trade. Teams like the Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and New York Giants could be interested in a deal, but they'd have to be willing to take on the contract and convince Cousins to waive his no-trade clause. That could also happen later in the summer if a quarterback gets hurt or a team can't find a suitable solution in next month's NFL Draft, but it shows that a decision doesn't have to be made right now. It's a situation that defies cap management and requires a degree in mathematics. But it brings a temporary solution for what may be a long-term problem for the Falcons.|2025-03-16|https://atlallday.com/falcons-kirk-cousins-saga-comes-surprise-end-01jpdkwqw9j4
Son refuses to bury slain Mufti Shakir to protest 'non-provision' of security Son refuses to bury slain Mufti Shakir to protest 'non-provision' of security Pakistan Published On: Sun, 16 Mar 2025 00:57:09 PKT PESHAWAR (Dunya News) - Slain Mufti Muneer Shakir's son has refused to bury his father in protest against not providing him with security despite repeated requests, Dunya News reported here on Saturday. The son of slain Mufti Muneer Shakir has refused to bury his father in protest against not providing him with security despite repeated requests to the KP government and police officers concerned. In a statement, Abdullah Shakir said his father had filed applications with SHO, CCPO and DCP concerned for providing him with security, but he was neither given security or issued a weapon licence. Why my father was not given security. I ask KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur and police officers why they did not make security arrangements for the protection of my father despite he was getting life threats from terrorists. I would not let the burial of my father unless the KP CM and police give me satisfactory answer to my questions with regard to the provision of security to my father, the son of murdered Mufti Muneer Shakir said. In a bomb blast in the vicinity of Urmur Police Station on Saturday, Mufti Muneer Shakir succumbed to the fatal injuries he received. Three other people were also injured in the incident who have been shifted to the local hospital. The police said the incident happened a few minutes before Iftar. After the blast, rescue teams, police officers and CTD officials reached the spot and ordered the preliminary investigation.|2025-03-16|https://dunyanews.tv/en/Pakistan/873581-son-refuses-to-bury-slain-mufti-shakir-to-protest-nonprovision-
Del. Jackie Addison (D-Baltimore City) wipes away a tear during two hours of emotional debate in the House Saturday on the so-called Second Look Act. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters) A bill that would let some inmates ask a judge to reduce their jail time after they have served decades cleared a preliminary vote in the House of Delegates Saturday. The emotionally charged debate over the so-called Second Look Act lasted more than two hours. House Democrats led by Judiciary Committee Chair Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City) beat back wave after wave of Republican amendments. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement It's not easy, but this is what we have to do, I believe, as a country of laws, and it's a country that believes that people do, in fact, change, said Clippinger, adding that crafting the bill was not a political exercise. A limited number of people would likely be eligible under the proposal. The individuals that would qualify for this today, looking back retrospectively, deserve a second look, said Del. N. Scott Phillips (D-Baltimore County). First, the law would only apply to people who were convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 and 25. It would not be available to anyone who was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, and an eligible inmate could only apply for a hearing before a judge after serving 20 years. We came to it soberly, and we came to it thoughtful, and we believe that what is important is to look at that person and say: What have you done to change yourself? What have you done to be a different person today than you were 20 years ago? Clippinger said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Clippinger acknowledged that for some who have lost loved ones, there is no amount of time in prison that brings closure. Let's be clear, the victims will absolutely agree it will never be enough because they've lost their loved one, because they've lost the person they're closest to, because they are feeling unlimited pain, and they want someone else to feel that pain, Clippinger said. And so now we look at our criminal justice system to try to make them completely whole, and the truth is, the uncomfortable truth is, we never, ever can do that. An inmate would be able to petition for a petition reduction just three times, and would have to wait at least five years between petitions if they are turned down. House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany), an attorney, said persons convicted of serious crimes have a litany of appeals and motions to reduce sentences. Additionally, those that have sentences that allow for parole can plead their case before a state board. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He called the title of the bill a misnomer. So, it's not the Second Look Act, he said. It's the, I don't know, 14th, 15th Look Act. About 350 people would be currently eligible under the bill, Clippinger said. Republicans offered amendment after amendment to add specific crimes to the list that would be prohibited from seeking a sentence reduction, including the murder of children, pregnant women, homicides related to domestic violence, and crimes involving the deaths of police and parole officers. Each time, they were easily rebuffed. Each time, Republicans forced a roll call vote that might one day be used as an electoral cudgel in a coming campaign. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The bill — a priority of the Legislative Black Caucus — was one of dozens moved by the House during a rare Saturday session as the legislature approached a milepost Monday. The House and Senate are each racing to send legislation to the opposite chamber. Bills that do not make the Monday deadline have a more difficult time passing both chambers before the end of the 90-day session. A similar bill, also called the Second Look Act, has been introduced in the Senate, but has not yet moved out of the Judicial Proceedings Committee.|2025-03-16|https://www.yahoo.com/news/second-look-act-clears-key-230007728.html
Washington Capitalsforward Alex Ovechkin scored in the third period against the San Jose Sharks on Saturday to bring him within seven goals of Wayne Gretzky's goal scoring record. It was career goal No. 887 for Ovechkin. He now needs eight goals to surpass Gretzky's total of 894. The goal came with 9:06 left in the period when Ovechkin deflected Martin Fehervary's shot from the blueline past Sharks goaltender Georgi Romanov. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Ovechkin, 39, was drafted by the Capitals at No. 1 overall in 2004. He's played in 1,474 games over 20 seasons, earning the Rocket Richard Trophy as the league's top scorer nine times. He already owns the NHL record for power play goals (321) and shots on goal (6,810). In 2018, Ovechkin and the Capitals won the Stanley Cup, beating the Vegas Golden Knights in five games.

Ash, which will be released in December. She is one of Hollywood's most beloved leading ladies, her on-screen performances earning her multiple awards over 30 years, including an Oscar. But as these exclusive pictures show, British actress Kate Winslet is taking the lead behind the camera for the first time. The Titanic star, 49, was seen filming her directorial debut, Goodbye June, on the streets of London alongside an all-star cast including Andrea Riseborough, Toni Collette and Timothy Spall. The Netflix project is described as a contemporary family drama about 'fractured siblings who must come together under sudden and trying circumstances'. And it is certainly a family affair for the actress as her 21-year-old son, Joe Anders, whose father is Bond director Sam Mendes, wrote the screenplay. But Ms Winslet – who won plaudits for her role as Lee Miller, the model who became a Second World War photographer, in the 2023 biopic Lee – showed she is not ready to turn her back on acting any time soon, also starring in the production. She was seen in character wearing a cream wool coat, neutral trousers and jumper, on a set which had been designed to look like the outside of a Cheltenham hospital. Later, she scrutinised the footage and wrapped up warmly in a padded jacket to direct her co-stars. The mother-of-three previously told Elizabeth Day's podcast, How To Fail, that people in the industry had encouraged her to direct, saying that it could 'change the culture' of male-dominated Hollywood.

Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.kazu.org/npr-news/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation

GLENDALE, Ariz. — Bo Jackson addressed the White Sox clubhouse Saturday morning, and he had an attentive audience. A walking mythological creature, right-hander Davis Martin said. One of the greatest athletes of all-time and the only professional athlete to be named an All-Star in two professional sports, Jackson, who played for the White Sox from 1991-93, told players to keep it simple. Just a motivational speech to go out there and have fun, infielder Brooks Baldwin said. Play like it's old-school ball. Have fun and play hard. Jackson, 62, a Sox ambassador since 2014, has been seen in camp in recent days. Martin saw him at the fence watching a B game when he pitched three hitless innings against a Japanese independent team Thursday. I can't embarrass myself in front of Bo Jackson, I need to lock in here, Martin told himself. Growing up in Texas, where football is king, Martin knew all about Bo. So did Baldwin, whose father, Chuck played baseball at Clemson from 1984-87 when Jackson was winning a Heisman Trophy in football and attracting scouts on the baseball field. When my dad played first base he said he could hear footsteps in the dirt when Bo was coming down the line, Baldwin said. First baseman Andrew Vaughn has heard Jackson before, and his presence is always felt. The guy is all-time, Vaughn said. DH options Manager Will Venable's plan to keep the designated hitter spot fluid hasn't changed. Brandon Drury is one possibility but several other infielders play multiple positions including first base as well. The extra outfielder will also fit in, especially when Andrew Benintendi's broken bone in his hand heals. There's going to be a lot of factors on a given day with who we have on the mound, what kind of defense we want behind him, what does that mean for our outfield, our infield, and having a DH spot, Venable said. Just gives us a lot of flexibility to match up how we want. Shortstop open Venable said shortstop is still open and wasn't tipping his hand if a leading candidate exists among Chase Meidroth, who hasn't played in the majors, and Jacob Amaya, a .182 hitter in 77 career games. The pair was 7-for-47 between them entering Friday, although Meidroth has drawn seven walks. Amaya, the better defender with the better arm, made two nice plays Saturday, including a diving stop on his backhand and strong throw to first. He was also 1-for-2. You have to factor everything, Venable said. Whoever's going to be out there is going to be someone that we have a high level of confidence in defensively, but also offensively and on the bases. Major league shortstop, you've got to be able to do a lot of things well. Perez likes adjustment Veteran lefty Martin Perez lowered his hands in his set position at the suggestion of pitching coach Ethan Katz and liked the results over four innings of one-run ball with six strikeouts, two walks and five hits, one a homer by Ezequiel Tovar in the first. I feel better and was trying to get back to [where his hands were, at his belt in] 2022 with that rhythm on the mound, Perez said. Today was really nice to feel what I feel. Sox 2, Rockies 1 Diamondbacks 9, Sox 8 After the Sox were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position, Tristan Gray and Jordan Sprinkle came through with RBI singles against the Rockies in the ninth in Glendale. Sprinkle replaced third baseman Josh Rojas in the fourth when Rojas left with a sore right big toe. Rojas got clipped making a swipe tag at third base. In Scottsdale, Wilfred Veras' two-run double keyed a four-run eighth but the Sox were walked off on Trey Mancini's homer in the ninth. *Korey Lee (.409) was 2-for-2 against the Rockies and Miguel Vargas (.393) was 1-for-3 with an RBI against the D-backs. *Sean Burke, likely making the starting rotation, gave up three hits and two walks in 3 2/3 innings of two-run ball at the Diamondbacks. *Mike Clevinger, bidding for a closer's role, threw his third scoreless inning. Penn Murfee and Steven Wilson also kept their spring ERAs to 0.00. On deck: Sox at Rangers, 3:05 p.m., Sunday, Surprise, Bryse Wilson vs. Jack Leiter.

Police in Idaho are investigating an incident in which a man on parole from a rape conviction shot at his ex-wife and then killed himself. Caldwell Police said they were called to the scene just after 10 p.m. on Thursday and found Jeramie Kuhlman lying near a tree with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, KBOI said. Witnesses told police that Kuhlman shot at his ex-wife before turning the gun on himself. The two apparently had an argument before the gunfire. Kuhlman was taken to a hospital in Boise, where he died. Kuhlman was accused of breaking into a woman's home in 2008 and raping her in front of her toddler, KBOI reported.

TOKYO (AP) — The Tokyo Series — a.k.a. the celebration of Shohei Ohtani — begins this week in a festive atmosphere. The Japanese two-way star is among the most beloved athletes in the world and coming off one of the best seasons in the history of Major League Baseball while earning his third MVP for the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers. It's easy to forget that almost exactly one year ago, his career was briefly on the rocks. The Dodgers were playing the San Diego Padres in Seoul, South Korea, last March when a bombshell was revealed: Ohtani's interpreter and close friend Ippei Mizuhara was being criminally investigated for ties to an illegal gambling ring and had stolen a huge amount of money from the baseball star. Eventually, Mizuhara would plead guilty to bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player's bank account. He was sentenced to nearly five years in federal prison in February. Ohtani was never implicated in the scandal, but it was the first whiff of controversial news for a player with a squeaky-clean reputation. Looking back, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said it was a valuable lesson. He's really become his own man, Roberts said. I think his English has gotten considerably better. He's handling a lot of matters by himself and not having any type of conduit. I think he's opened himself up more to staff, the players, his teammates. It's just good to see him become his own man, and I say that in an honest and positive way. Ohtani is no longer a young man by baseball standards — he turned 30 last July — and is in the prime of a one-of-a-kind career. He revealed last spring he was married to Mamiko Tanaka and the couple is expecting a baby later this year. Combined with the Mizuhara situation, the developments have forced Ohtani to mature, becoming a more well-rounded individual. That could serve him well as he deals with the reality of his surgically-repaired body. Ohtani had surgery during the offseason to repair a torn labrum in his left (non-throwing) shoulder that he suffered during the World Series. He's also trying to return to the pitcher's mound after needing major elbow surgery in 2023 for the second time in his career. Roberts said Ohtani's improved maturity was noticable earlier this month after the manager suggested that the player slow down his throwing program, instead concentrating on hitting for a few weeks to get the shoulder ready for his designated hitter role in 2025. Last year, Ohtani might have tried to push through without resting. This year, he took Roberts' advice. He's smart, he wants to pitch, he wants to hit, but he really understands that he had a major surgery (on his shoulder) and he's coming off another major surgery in his elbow, Roberts said. So to be as good as he expects to be, I think there's got to be some sacrifices. I think as you get older, you have more experiences, you're more likely to listen to stuff like that. It's fair to wonder if we've already seen the best of Ohtani, considering it's going to be nearly impossible to recreate last season, when he became the first player in MLB history to have at least 50 homers and 50 stolen bases in the same season. His stolen base attempts in 2025 figure to be down drastically — particularly early in the season — as he tries to protect his left shoulder. His projected return to the mound is in May, which could eat into his plate appearances later in the season. It'll be a delicate balance, but Ohtani and the Dodgers seem to be on the same page. I'm going to let the team dictate that, Ohtani said. I do want to play as much as possible, as many games as possible, but if the team feels like I should get a break, I'll follow that. If there's anything we've learned about Ohtani over the past seven years, it's that it would be foolish to put limits on what he can accomplish. The three-time MVP and the Dodgers open the season as favorites to capture a second straight World Series title. Ohtani hasn't lost his flair for the dramatic, either. In his first spring at-bat after shoulder surgery, he hit an opposite-field homer against Yusei Kikuchi. He does not cease to amaze, Roberts said. Every time Shohei gets up to bat, you've got to watch because something special might happen.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/world/2025/03/15/one-year-after-interpreters-scandal-shohei-ohtani-enters-the-tokyo-series-with-newfound-maturity/
In today's dynamic beverage industry, color is everything. It's not just about appearance—it's about branding, perception, and market positioning. Consumers associate vibrant, natural hues with freshness, quality, and health benefits. Enter chlorophyll, a plant-derived pigment that's revolutionizing the world of green beverages. Unlike artificial dyes, chlorophyll provides a rich, natural green hue while aligning perfectly with the clean-label movement. But color isn't the only advantage. Chlorophyll offers functional benefits, making it an attractive choice for health-conscious consumers. However, for manufacturers, understanding FDA regulations is essential to ensure compliance. This article explores why chlorophyll is the top choice for green beverages, its advantages over synthetic colorants, and how to integrate it effectively into your formulations. The Shift to Natural Colorants in the Beverage Industry The demand for natural ingredients is skyrocketing. Consumers today are wary of artificial additives and are actively choosing beverages that use plant-based colorants over synthetic dyes. For years, the industry relied on artificial green dyes like FD&C Green No. 3, but growing concerns about health risks and sustainability have triggered a shift. Consumers are pushing brands toward cleaner, eco-friendly solutions, and chlorophyll is leading the charge. Brands that embrace natural colorants gain a competitive edge, boosting brand trust and product appeal. Chlorophyll, with its rich green tone and natural origin, is a strategic choice for forward-thinking beverage companies. Chlorophyll in Beverages: A Natural Solution for Vibrant Green Drinks Chlorophyll is the universal green pigment found in plants. Extracted from alfalfa, spinach, and other leafy greens, it serves as a powerful natural colorant in various beverages. Unlike synthetic alternatives, chlorophyll provides a deep green shade while reinforcing a brand's commitment to clean-label, plant-based ingredients. It is widely used in: Soft Drinks & Sodas – Adding a natural green twist to carbonated beverages. Energy Drinks – Enhancing functional and wellness-focused products. Beers & Hard Seltzers – Creating unique craft brews with an eye-catching hue. Cocktails & Alcoholic Beverages – Perfect for artisanal and health-forward mixology. Beyond aesthetics, chlorophyll offers antioxidant properties that can be marketed as a functional benefit, making it a valuable ingredient in the booming wellness beverage sector. Why Choose Chlorophyll Over Synthetic Green Dyes? Chlorophyll powder provides multiple advantages over synthetic colorants: Clean-Label Appeal – Consumers prefer natural, recognizable ingredients over chemicals. Eco-Friendly – Derived from plants, supporting sustainability efforts. Safe & Non-Toxic – Unlike artificial dyes, chlorophyll doesn't pose potential health risks. Stable & Versatile – Works across various beverage formulations. Cost-Effective in the Long Run – Reduces risk of regulatory scrutiny on artificial dyes. While synthetic dyes like Green No. 3 face growing scrutiny, chlorophyll emerges as a trusted, plant-based alternative, allowing brands to meet market demand for transparency and health-conscious choices. Liquid vs. Powdered Chlorophyll: Which One to Use? When formulating beverages with chlorophyll, choosing the right form is essential. Liquid Chlorophyll Easily blends into beverages. Provides a smooth, even color. Ideal for large-scale production where quick mixing is needed. Powdered Chlorophyll More concentrated, allowing for precise color control. Longer shelf life and easier storage. Best for custom color formulations and premium products. Each option offers unique benefits, so beverage manufacturers should select based on product type, stability needs, and production process. Navigating FDA Guidelines for Chlorophyll in Beverages The FDA regulates the use of chlorophyll in foods and beverages to ensure consumer safety. Manufacturers must comply with: Concentration Limits – Only approved levels of chlorophyll can be used. Labeling Requirements – Chlorophyll must be listed accurately in ingredient declarations. Purity Standards – Ensuring chlorophyll meets safety criteria for consumption. Staying updated on regulatory guidelines is critical. Brands should consult with regulatory experts to avoid compliance issues that could delay product launches or lead to recalls. Consumer Trends Driving Chlorophyll's Popularity Several market trends are fueling the demand for chlorophyll in beverages: Plant-Based Movement – More consumers prefer natural, vegan-friendly ingredients. Functional Beverages – Wellness drinks featuring antioxidants and detox benefits are on the rise. Clean Label Demand – Brands using recognizable, natural ingredients gain consumer trust. Sustainability Push – Chlorophyll aligns with eco-conscious product development. By embracing chlorophyll as a natural colorant, beverage companies stay ahead of evolving consumer expectations while boosting their brand image. How to Successfully Formulate Beverages with Chlorophyll To achieve the best results when using chlorophyll, manufacturers should follow these best practices: Start with Small Test Batches – Monitor color impact and adjust concentration. Ensure Stability – Consider factors like pH levels and storage conditions. Pair with Complementary Flavors – Works well with citrus, mint, and herbal profiles. Balance the Color Intensity – Overuse can alter flavor perception. Choose the Right Format – Liquid for fast mixing, powder for longer shelf life. Strategic formulation ensures consistent, visually appealing, and market-ready beverages. The Future of Chlorophyll in the Beverage Industry Chlorophyll is more than just a natural green colorant—it represents a movement toward healthier, more sustainable products. As consumers continue to reject artificial additives, brands that incorporate chlorophyll will stand out in an increasingly competitive market. From soft drinks to craft beers to energy drinks, chlorophyll is transforming the beverage industry with its vibrant color, clean-label appeal, and functional benefits. In that regard, a trusted leading company in natural colorants like IMBAREX offers high-quality solutions tailored to market demands. Their expertise ensures that your products remain visually stunning while also fitting the growing demand for clean-label, natural ingredients.

Severe weather conditions are expected to keep law enforcement and first responders busy through the weekend. With the potential for damage, fires, and accidents, local authorities are urging residents to take precautions and help ease the strain on emergency services. Sergeant David Holloway with the Signal Mountain Police Department shared that their team has been preparing for the worst since Monday. They have been actively sharing safety reminders and providing tools to help residents navigate potential escalations in the weather, including the possibility of tornadoes. Know where to go when sheltering from a tornado You should have a safety plan, and have multiple ways to receive warnings, says the weather service. Police departments around the county right now, especially when this weather is severe, it stretches us thin, said Holloway. As the storm moves through the area, first responders are encouraging the public to stay home if possible to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads and allow them to focus on critical incidents. When it rains and winds like we get right now, there are definitely a lot of downed trees. Give us a chance to get there, our first responders, our fire department, our public works. If you don't need to be on the road, don't, Holloway advised. Storm shelters and alert options in the Tennessee Valley If your county is not listed, reach out to Emergency Management where you live. The weather is expected to calm briefly before intensifying again later on Saturday evening. Holloway suggested that residents use this break to prepare for the worst. He says you should stock up on necessary items like batteries for flashlights or portable chargers for your phones. My power has been out for about 20 minutes now. You should expect power to go in and out, or be out for long periods of time, he added. For those who do need to venture out on the roads, Holloway stressed the importance of being cautious. Drivers should be aware of scattered debris and flooded roadways. The biggest thing is make sure your headlights are on so people can see you, he said. First responders are also asking for patience in the event of an emergency. With a high volume of calls expected, response times may be delayed, but officials are assuring residents that help is on the way. Power outages in the Tennessee Valley Here is where you can keep track of any power outages in Tennessee Valley. It's everybody's personal responsibility to get prepared to take care of themselves and their family, and this is the day to do that, said Amy Maxwell with the Hamilton County Office of Emergency Management. As severe weather continues to impact the region, officials stress the importance of personal preparedness and caution. By staying off the roads, stocking up on essentials, and being patient, residents can help ensure that first responders can focus on saving lives and addressing the most urgent needs.|2025-03-16|https://www.local3news.com/local-news/severe-weather-strains-first-responders-public-urged-to-stay-safe-prepared-at-home/article_5dae22aa-01bb-11f0-87c4-431a5750a339.html
Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Wes Streeting suggested hundreds more quangos could be in the firing line after the Prime Minister announced the end of the body overseeing the health service in England. He said: The abolition of NHS England – the world's largest quango – is the beginning, not the end. Patients and staff alike can see the inefficiency and waste in the health service. My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy. NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it was established to cut down on political interference in the NHS – something Mr Streeting described as an act of backside-covering to avoid blame for failures. Sir Keir Starmer delivers a speech announcing the abolition of NHS England / Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visit to Yorkshire / Sir Keir Starmer announced the abolition of NHS England in a surprise move on Thursday (Oli Scarff/PA) But on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the Government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid duplication . In his Sunday Telegraph article, Mr Streeting suggested more was to come, saying new NHS England chair Penny Dash had identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration . The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Mr Streeting, who in January of this year said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS. He told the Health Service Journal he could spend a hell of a lot of time on reorganisation and not make a single difference to the patient interest , saying instead he would focus on trying to eliminate waste and duplication . But in the Sunday Telegraph, he said he had heard former Conservative health ministers bemoan not abolishing NHS England, adding: If we hadn't acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn't have been possible. The Government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline services. But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.|2025-03-16|https://www.clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk/news/national/25011411.quangos-firing-line-nhs-england-scrapped---streeting/

OTTAWA — Mark Carney will make his first foray on the world stage as Canada's 24th prime minister on a trip to France and the U.K. in coming days. The Prime Minister's Office said in a release Saturday the aim of the trip is to strengthen two of our closest and longest-standing economic and security partnerships, and to reaffirm Canada's Arctic security and sovereignty, with an additional stop in Iqaluit, Nvt. Carney will leave Sunday and return Tuesday. He said he was invited by French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for visits to reinforce historical relationships and discuss trade and security. The PMO release said Carney and Macron will focus on their shared commitment to build stronger economic, commercial, and defence ties, and Carney will talk about Canada's efforts involving artificial intelligence. His discussions with Starmer will focus on strengthening transatlantic security, growing the AI sector, and the strong commercial relationship between Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as bilateral trade, the PMO said. Carney will also meet with King Charles. On Tuesday, he will stop in Iqaluit to reassert Canada's sovereignty in the Arctic. Carney will also meet with Nunavut premier P.J. Akeeagok. The PMO said Carney will reaffirm support for growing a stronger economy across the North, reinforcing its sovereignty and security, and emphasizing our continued commitment to advancing reconciliation with First Nations, Inuit, and Metis throughout the country. Carney has no plan yet to visit the United States, though he said he looks forward to speaking with U.S. President Donald Trump at the appropriate moment. He was sworn in to succeed Justin Trudeau at a ceremony at Rideau Hall Friday, along with a leaner Liberal cabinet, ahead of an election call that is expected soon. In his first press conference as prime minister, Carney said his government will focus on growing the economy, making life more affordable and making the country more secure.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/03/15/prime-minister-mark-carney-to-visit-france-uk-for-first-foreign-trip/

(CNN) — Do you find yourself reaching for an alcoholic drink to unwind and drift off to sleep? Whether it's an old-fashioned, a hot toddy or even an espresso martini, many people have a favorite evening beverage that signals the end of a long day. But what's the history behind this nightly ritual? The tradition of enjoying a drink to promote better sleep — known as a nightcap — dates to the early 18th century. The term nightcap originally referred to a literal hat worn at night before modern heating, designed to keep the head warm for more restful sleep. Over time, people began associating this warming sensation with the effects of an evening alcoholic drink, an idea that persists in popular culture today. However, as health officials continue to issue warnings about the dangers of alcohol, it might be time to ditch the nightly habit. In January, then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on the cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption and called for updated health warnings on alcoholic beverages. And the negative impact of alcohol can also extend to your sleep. Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant, which is why it causes drowsiness, said Dr. Anthony Reffi, a clinical psychologist and assistant scientist at Henry Ford Health's Sleep Disorders and Research Center in Detroit, via email. However, it negatively impacts sleep quality, causing night-time awakenings that leave people feeling tired the next day. How does alcohol affect sleep? The effects of alcohol on sleep vary and are influenced by factors such as sex, body weight, metabolism and the amount of alcohol consumed, Dr. Deirdre Conroy, clinical director of the behavioral sleep medicine program and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, said via email. While a higher dose of alcohol generally makes it easier to fall asleep, it also increases the likelihood of waking up in the middle of the night, Conroy said. Alcohol works by inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitters in the brain — the chemicals responsible for firing up functions in the body and keeping it alert — making people feel sleepy more quickly, said Dr. Timothy Roehrs, former director of research at the Sleep Disorders and Research Center of Henry Ford Health System. Drinking alcohol before bed raises blood alcohol content, which disrupts rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep, a critical phase of the sleep cycle responsible for cognitive functions such as memory, concentration and mood regulation. During the first three to four hours of sleep, alcohol is reaching its peak concentration in the body, which explains the initial onset of that sleepy sensation. However, in the second half of the night, people will experience a rebound effect, resulting in more frequent awakenings and disturbances as the night progresses and alcohol is metabolized, Reffi said. Moderate and high doses of alcohol also reduce the overall amount of REM sleep an individual gets in a night, Reffi added. Research also shows that people with chronic insomnia may find temporary relief from alcohol use before bed, but the effects are short-lived. One study conducted at Henry Ford Health's Sleep Disorders and Research Center found that participants who drank a high dose of alcohol before bed initially slept longer than those who consumed a low dose or none. However, when assessed a week later, those differences disappeared, and the high-dose drinkers were sleeping less and experiencing fewer minutes in deep sleep, Reffi said. Beyond affecting the quality of your sleep, regular alcohol consumption before bed can have long-term consequences, such as increased tolerance to its sedative effects and a higher risk of alcohol dependence. Additionally, combining alcohol with other medications taken at bedtime could intensify its calmative effects, potentially leading to injuries if you get out of bed during the night, Conroy said. Exploring healthier sleep habits If you're hoping for more restorative sleep, it may be time to reconsider your evening routine and explore healthier alternatives to a nightly drink. Nonalcoholic beverages have become an increasingly popular choice for those looking to unwind without the negative side effects of alcohol. Many brands now offer options that mimic the same bite associated with cocktails while still providing a satisfying drink to help people relax before bed, Reffi said. Alternatively, herbal teas or choices such as a sleepy girl mocktail can also provide a calming effect similar to alcohol. However, drinking too much liquid before bed can also lead to disruptions and frequent trips to the restroom in the middle of the night, so it's best to avoid drinking too much close to bedtime. It's also important to steer clear of caffeine for at least eight to 10 hours before sleep to avoid interfering with your body's natural sleep cycles. For those who consistently struggle with sleep disruptions, talking to a trained professional can help uncover any underlying issues, Conroy said, but establishing a consistent wind-down routine can help signal to your body that it's time to rest. She added that incorporating relaxation techniques, avoiding stimulating activities before bed and limiting naps can greatly improve sleep quality as well as exercising regularly. Try other activities that help promote relaxation before bed: read, meditate, journal, pray or spend time with loved ones, Reffi said. Avoid activities that stress you out before bed — turn off the news, get off social media and put your phone on do not disturb. The-CNN-Wire ™ & © 2025 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Denmark's Holger Rune beat Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-4 to reach the Indian Wells ATP Masters final on Saturday, denying the Russian world number six a third straight trip to the title match. Rune, ranked 13th, snapped a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals and will face either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Britain's Jack Draper on Sunday. It means everything, Rune said. The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing. Playing Daniil is one of the toughest challenges for me on tour. I obviously had the right tactics, but it was still so difficult because he puts in great effort and is super solid. In a rematch of last year's quarter-finals, the 21-year-old Rune showed admirable discipline against the Medvedev's vaunted defense, sticking in the rallies and keeping the Russian off balance with a variety of shots while making judicious use of his powerful forehand. After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes. He gained the decisive break for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev. The second set was a more straightforward affair after Rune broke Medvedev at love for a 2-1 lead. After two nervy points as he served for the match, Rune rallied from 0-30 down and survived another mammoth rally to give himself a match point, punctuating the victory with a forehand winner. It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got good leg work, so I can reach many balls, Rune said. It's about finding the right pace and which shots to hit, because so many players miss too many shots against Daniil. He makes you go for more, so I'm super proud that I managed to find the right rhythm. Rune, whose ascent has slowed since he burst on the scene in 2022 with a victory over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final, reached his first tour-level final since Brisbane in January of 2024. bb/sev|2025-03-16|https://www.youralaskalink.com/news/national/rune-shocks-medvedev-to-reach-indian-wells-atp-final/article_fd449364-1923-5e4f-8318-0a6d79916317.html

SARASOTA, Fla. (WWSB) - For the second week in a row, more than one hundred demonstrators, many with signs in hand, lined sidewalks near the Tesla dealership at the Mall at University Town Center. The protest, organized by We Are Indivisible Sarasota, is geared at expressing concerns over massive cuts of jobs and departments at the federal government level by Tesla founder Elon Musk. If you were going to make cuts, you'd bring an accountant or an auditor with you, to analyze if you were going to find waste, not a bunch of twenty-year-old computer programmers who wouldn't know waste if it bit them in the face, said protest organizer Jeff Fox. Those opposed to the drastic changes were met by several President Trump and Elon Musk supporters who feel the changes should be looked at as progress, and a new way of moving forward. I applaud the efforts happening at doge right now, I've been on their website myself to see the progress they've made and they're showing all the waste, and the fraud that's happening at the federal level, added Rachel Frank, with the Sarasota County Republican State Committee. Both sides said they encourage people, if interested, to reach out to both their local and state leaders to express their feelings and thoughts over the new measures implemented by the Trump administration.|2025-03-16|https://www.mysuncoast.com/2025/03/15/demonstrators-gather-tesla-dealership-over-us-democracy-concerns/
The Canadian government is considering canceling its contract with U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin in light of the imposed tariffs by the Trump administration, the CBC reported. In June 2023, Canada signed a $19 billion contract to purchase 88 of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. But the Canadian government is looking for alternatives to their air defense in response to the ongoing tariff war and President Donald Trump's repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Canada has already paid for 16 of the aircraft and is weary about supporting and maintaining a mixed fleet of fighter jets that would require their own unique training, hangers, infrastructure, and supply chain, all of which would increase cost. The first shipment of F-35s is scheduled to be delivered early in 2026. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Team Liquid PH is on top of the world in the ongoing Mobile Legends Professional League Season 15 after an impressive sweep over defending champion ONIC PH during Week 3, Day 2 of the tournament last Saturday at Green Sun Hotel in Makati. KarlTzy, Oheb, Jaypee, Sanford, and Sanji needed just 11 minutes in Game 1 to draw first blood against the reigning M6 world champion ONIC PH. In Game 2, Kiel Oheb Soriano scored a Maniac, killing four of five ONIC players en route to winning the series in 16 minutes. Nice game to them; they are a strong team. I think our rivalry [Oheb vs Kelra] is now just a healthy rivalry, unlike before when it was toxic. Respect [to him], he is a world champion, Oheb said after the match as Team Liquid PH improved its season standing to 5-0. Earlier in the day, fan favorite Aurora scored a 2-1 win over Omega to also maintain its unbeaten streak in the season.

Violent tornadoes that ripped through parts of the U.S. proved deadly as well as destructive as whipping winds moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, with at least 17 people killed and scores of homes decimated. The most fatalities as of Saturday morning were in Missouri, authorities said, which was pounded by scattered twisters overnight that resulted in at least 11 deaths. The Missouri State Highway Patrol also reported that multiple people were injured. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. However, rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said. Officials in Arkansas said on Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency in their respective states. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving toward the state later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma due to fire. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) have burned so far in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. This is terrible out here, said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes, some of which could be long-track and violent, are expected Saturday afternoon and evening. The region at highest risk stretches from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi in the afternoon and then Alabama and western portions of Georgia and the Florida panhandle in the evening, the Center said. Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Apart from Oklahoma, wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. SEC cancels Party in the Park The Southeastern Conference already had canceled outdoor activities around Saturday's men's basketball tournament semifinals in Nashville, Tennessee, due to the weather forecast. With Saturday bringing heavy rain leaving water pooling at the Music City Walk of Fame Park across from Bridgestone Arena, league officials canceled Sunday's SEC Party in the Park. They also opened arena doors a bit earlier to let fans in out of heavy downpours. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.|2025-03-16|https://www.kimt.com/news/monster-storm-across-the-us-sparks-scores-of-tornadoes-and-fire-killing-at-least-17/article_f26d88a6-019b-11f0-95c7-873ebbd23bf5.html

Gavitt made the comments on CBS in the lead-up to Sunday's announcement of the field of 68 teams. Flagg sprained his left ankle during Duke's win against Georgia Tech on Thursday in the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament quarterfinals. The 6-foot-9 forward — named the ACC player and newcomer of the year by The Associated Press on Tuesday — missed Friday's semifinal win against rival North Carolina. Afterward, coach Jon Scheyer ruled Flagg out for Saturday night's title game against No. 13 Louisville.

The Motor Company has just announced its wildest limited-edition motorcycle since the V-Rod Destroyer. This is the largest displacement, most powerful production Harley-Davidson to ever go on sale. It is a touring motorcycle called the CVO Road Glide RR, directly inspired by the racing machine in the MotoAmerica King Of The Baggers series. It is fast, it has racing-spec components, it is a limited-run model that will be sold only in the US market, and it will, in the right hands, surprise a sports bike or two. Yet, for the vast majority, the CVO Road Glide ST will make more sense. That's a very controversial statement, but we'll stand by it for a number of reasons – reasons that we'll list below. So sit back, grab your favorite drink, and let us tell you why you'd be better off with a CVO Road Glide ST rather than a CVO Road Glide RR. To ensure accuracy, the information compiled in this article was sourced from authoritative sources, including the respective manufacturers' official websites. Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR side profile cinematic view Related The Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR is a lot more exclusive than the ST. The CVO Road Glide RR Costs Over Twice As Much As The CVO Road Glide ST 1 CVO Road Glide RR = 2 CVO Road Glide STs + Change The CVO Road Glide RR is made with some of the best materials in the business. There are swathes of carbon fiber, billet aluminum, and everything is handcrafted to perfection. Don't believe us? Look carefully at the fairing, and you'll notice that the orange-to-black paint job doesn't really have any black in it. That is the exposed carbon fiber weave. Harley has made this negative space a design as well, which is incredible. And incredibly difficult to repair, too, should something go wrong. Race bikes tend to have a few spare fairings handy, but imagine ordering one of these if you bin it. Oh, and you won't need just the fairing. The saddlebags are also made of carbon fiber, as is the seat base, fender, side covers, tank console, fork nacelle, and radiator shrouds. Rider on a 2025 Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide ST Remember us mentioning aluminum? Here are the things made of the metal on the RR: intake manifold, footpegs, wheels, brake calipers, and the entire swingarm. Aluminum is really light and strong, but it is a pain to work with when it comes to repairs. All of these parts are handmade for the CVO Road Glide RR, which brings us to its price. Harley-Davidson doesn't even mention its price on its website. Hey, if you have to ask, you can't afford it, right? Well, the company is asking for $110,000 for each CVO Road Glide RR. It seems a little excessive when you realize that a CVO Road Glide ST costs under $45,000. And that is also a model that Harley says is modeled after its racing bike. Differences In Materials Used Model CVO Road Glide ST CVO Road Glide RR Swingarm Mild steel, two-piece drawn and welded section; forged junctions; MIG welded One-piece billet aluminum performance swingarm from Harley-Davidson Factory Racing Fairing material ABS Carbon fiber Wheels Cast aluminum Custom billet aluminum The CVO Road Glide RR Is Limited To Just 131 Units It's A Gentle Way Of Saying Already Sold Out 2025 Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR tank and fairing graphict close-up detail Harley-Davidson has called its CVO models limited run models. But production is always plenty for all of us to enjoy them. They might as well be, though since they are priced at such a high premium compared to the models they are based on. For example, the CVO Road Glide ST retails at $44,999, the CVO Road Glide for $45,999, and the regular Road Glide retails for just $27,999. That's a difference of $17,000-18,000, which means you could have a Street Bob and a Road Glide for the price of a CVO. Of course, Harley will argue that it is putting all of its latest tech into the CVOs, not to mention exclusive features. But therein lies the truth – these are supposed to be exclusive models that showcase the capability of the manufacturer, quite like a liter superbike. So it is alright that they cost a lot of money. Their price also makes them limited run models by default. 2024 Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide ST tank close-up detail Harley-Davidson KOTB Bradley Smith Action 2 Related A MotoGP veteran joins the H-D factory racing team in 2025 However, the CVO Road Glide RR has been officially stated to be a limited-run model. Only 131 will be made and all will be put on sale in the US market only. This is a standard marketing strategy – if demand outstrips supply, the value of the item increases. The high price of the CVO RR ensures that it will remain a collectible, and we expect most of them to go into collections as investments. In the same way as a Ferrari halo model, we expect that the 131 units are already spoken for. Or will run out really soon, simply because of the investment angle. If an ordinary person (well, an ordinary person with at least $50k in disposable income) wants a CVO Road Glide, the safest bet would be a CVO Road Glide ST. Pricing Differences Model CVO Road Glide ST CVO Road Glide RR Price $44,999 $110,000 The CVO Road Glide RR Is A Special Bike With Bank-Breaking Maintenance Race Bikes Need A Lot Of TLC Milwaukee-Eight 131 in a 2025 Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR engine close-up detail The Screamin' Eagle 131 ci in the CVO Road Glide RR is an amazing engine--Harley-Davidson's most powerful production unit today. It is also now the largest V-twin as well as the largest twin-cylinder engine ever fitted to a production motorcycle in history. The power output lies at 153 horsepower and 150 pound-feet of torque from its 2,153 cc displacement. This is 26 horsepower and 5 pound-feet more than the CVO Road Glide ST's output. Interestingly, the RR has a lower compression ratio than the ST, which means it should run just fine on the same fuel as the ST. All the exotic materials make the RR 50 pounds lighter than the ST. So power-to-weight ratio would be quite impeccable here. Moving on, while you go fast, you stop faster, too. The RR has Brembo brakes that Harley says have taken lessons from MotoGP, the pinnacle of two-wheeled racing. The specs certainly make them look up to the task: the GP4-RX calipers are machined from a block of aluminum and finished in a heat-dissipating nickel plating. The brake discs themselves are Brembo T-Drive discs which are fully floating discs – something that you will not see on many road bikes, no matter the category. All that sounds wonderful, we know. But a little-known and discussed feature of any race vehicle is the maintenance required. Harley-Davidson CVO Road Glide RR performance intake and exhaust system Engines are rebuilt every few races, exotic lubricants and fuels are used, and every single part is meticulously examined after every race to make sure it will do the job it is meant to. The CVO Road Glide RR isn't an all-out race bike, but with the kind of equipment it has, you will need to make sure you get the right tools as well as technicians, neither of which will be cheap. One more thing you'll need to do with the CVO Road Glide RR is regular chain maintenance and lubrication. Yes, this is the second Harley-Davidson with a chain final drive, after the Pan America 1250! In comparison, the CVO Road Glide ST has a belt final drive, so it is a maintenance-free system. Of course, this also means swapping the chain and sprocket kit once it has worn out, and that will happen, with the way this bike is intended to be ridden. Finally, in race trim, the CVO Road Glide RR has a pommel at the front of the seat, on the tank. That is to prevent the rider from sliding up onto the tank under braking, and to anchor the outside knee during cornering. The pommel has been left out of all the press materials because it looks… ungainly. And that's being kind to it.

This allows you to upgrade the performance of your current Harleys. Browsing through the Screamin' Eagle parts list reveals that you can upgrade a 2025 CVO Road Glide ST with the Screamin' Eagle 135 ci Stage IV performance crate engine. This 2,212 cc V-twin offers 145 pound-feet and 130 horsepower at the rear wheel. Accounting for transmission losses, that's almost as much as the CVO Road Glide RR's figures. Browse further through the Screamin' Eagle catalog, and you'll find Öhlins inverted front forks, rear shocks with remote reservoirs, the King 6 racing transmission, and any other matching parts that you might require. All of this will cost you an extra $20,000 or so over the cost of the CVO Road Glide ST, which still brings the overall price to $65,000. That's around 60 percent of the cost of the CVO Road Glide RR. Of course, you won't have the exotic carbon fiber and billet aluminum. But what you will have is a usable motorcycle.

image_2024-10-29_144434132 / The Honourable Mme Justice Chantal Ononaiwu, Judge of the Caribbean Court of Justice - Advertisement - On Tuesday, 29 October 2024, the Honourable Mme Justice Chantal Ononaiwu was sworn in as a Judge of the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ), becoming the second Jamaican national to join the Bench of the regional Court. The swearing-in ceremony was conducted by the Governor General of Jamaica, His Excellency the Most Honourable Sir Patrick Allen, at King's House, Kingston, Jamaica. In his remarks during the ceremony, the Honourable Mr Justice Adrian Saunders, CCJ President, noted that Article IV(1) of the Agreement Establishing the Court requires that when the Court… at least three [judges] must possess expertise in international law including international trade law. Mme Justice Ononaiwu is not merely an expert in international law, she is more specifically an expert in international trade law and an active practitioner in the field. She has appeared as counsel before the CCJ in many of the Court's seminal cases dealing with the CSME. She has experience in adjudicating WTO international trade disputes. The job she previously held involved negotiating international trade issues on behalf of the Caribbean Community. Indeed, she led the coordination of CARICOM's external trade policy. Caricom's undoubted massive loss is the CCJ's gain, but I venture to suggest that the region would benefit even more greatly from her tenure on the Court. Mme Justice Ononaiwu was chosen from a pool of 12 applicants by the Regional Judicial and Legal Services Commission (RJLSC), an independent body of 11 individuals responsible for appointing the Judges and staff of the Court. Applicants must have either served as a judge for at least five years or have a minimum of 15 years of experience in the practice or teaching of law. Additionally, candidates are evaluated on criteria including high moral character, intellectual and analytical abilities, sound judgment, integrity, and an understanding of people and society. With over 20 years of legal experience, Mme Justice Ononaiwu brings specialist expertise in Caribbean Community (CARICOM) law and international law, including international trade law. Her varied legal background includes roles as an adjudicator, litigator, legal advisor, and university lecturer. Mme Justice Ononaiwu also has significant expertise in commercial law, having worked in the international business and financial services sector as the Director of Value Proposition Development at Invest Barbados. Additionally, she served as Vice-Chair of the International Chamber of Commerce Digital Standards Initiative Legal Reform Advisory Board. She has also lectured on international trade and investment law, public international law, and criminal law at The University of the West Indies. Prior to her appointment to the CCJ, she served as Director of External Trade at the CARICOM Secretariat and previously as a Trade Policy and Legal Specialist.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/new-judge-sworn-into-the-caribbean-court-of-justice/

basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-poll and (AP) — Tionna Lidge scored 11 points and grabbed 10 rebounds — the senior's first career double-double — to help No. 1 seed Southern beat Alcorn State 64-44 on Saturday night to win the Southwestern Athletic Conference Tournament. Southern (20-14) clinched its seventh NCAA Tournament appearance in program history, all since 2002. DaKiyah Sanders and Soniyah Reed also scored 11 points apiece for Southern. Destiny Brown made a jumper 15 seconds into the second quarter that gave the Braves their last lead at 22-20. They went scoreless over the next 7 1/2 minutes as five different Southern players scored in a 14-0 run — including 3-pointers by Reed and Taniya Lawson — and the Jaguars took a 36-24 lead into halftime. No. 6 seed Alcorn State (14-18), which beat Southern 59-55 in overtime on the road in the only regular season meeting between the teams on Feb. 1, made 2 of 10 from the field, 0 of 5 from 3-point range, and committed seven turnovers as it was outscored 16-4 in the second quarter. The Braves trimmed their deficit to 38-31 when Sharmayne Finley hit a jumper a little more than two minutes into the third quarter but the Braves got no closer. Brown led Alcorn State with 12 points and three blocks. Finley added 11 points and Nakia Cheatham finished with 11 rebounds to go with six points. Southern, which went into the game leading the SWAC in scoring defense (57.3 per game) and forcing 20.2 turnovers per game (No. 28 nationally), limited the Braves to their second-lowest scoring output of the season. Alcorn State scored 41 in a 52-point loss to No. 25 Mississippi on Dec. 30. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - A seasoned wide receiver is expected to stay in the Chiefs Kingdom for the 2025 season per multiple reports. NFL Insider Jordan Schultz announced on Saturday afternoon, March 15, that multiple sources have reported that JuJu Smith-Schuster has re-signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. The wide receiver and a key weapon for Quarterback Patrick Mahomes will stay in the Kingdom. Schultz noted that Smith-Schuster had 18 catches for 231 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 2024 season. The former Pro Bowler had interest from other teams, but preferred to stay in Kansas City. Smith-Schuster, who played with the Chiefs during the 2022 season, was released by the New England Patriots after the 2023 season. He was welcomed back to Kansas City in 2024. The Chiefs also recently re-signed veteran running back Kareem Hunt after he was originally released from the team in 2018 but picked back up in 2024.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/good-juju-reports-say-seasoned-wide-receiver-will-return-kansas-city/
In a night filled with historic tornado activity, a long-held Missouri tornado record appears to have just been broken by a woman that was carried a record distance by a twister. On March 12, 2006, Matt Suter was caught up in a tornado in Fordland, Missouri and was carried 1,307 feet away yet he miraculously survived. That was the standing Guinness Book of World Records distance. Matt's record appears to have been broken by a woman in Society Hill, Mississippi who was picked up by a massive wedge tornado and carried a quarter-mile yet she lived. This is that wedge tornado in Mississippi that the woman survived as shared by The Weather Channel. When I see stories like this, I am reminded that miracles are very real. You can call it coincidence or luck if you want to, but I won't. Someone was obviously watching over this Mississippi woman's life just like He did for Matt Suter in Missouri back in 2006.

China Vanke has sold nearly three quarters of the more than 200 units on offer at its Le Mont project on the first day of sales, despite earlier reports indicating that some Hong Kong banks were refusing to extend mortgages to prospective buyers. By 5pm on Saturday, 162 of the 228 available flats at the new Tai Po residential project developed by Vanke Hong Kong, wholly owned by China Vanke, had been sold, said Sammy Po Siu-ming, CEO of Midland Realty's residential division. The flats - ranging from 214 sq ft to 873 sq ft - include 28 studios, 67 one-bedroom units, 93 two-bedroom units, 24 three-bedroom units, nine four-bedroom units and seven special units. They are part of a six-tower residential complex, projected to be completed by July 2026. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Prices for the units range from HK$2.38 million to HK$11.41 million (US$306,000 to US$1.47 million), while the price per square foot is between HK$9,185 and HK$14,392. That is over 30 per cent lower than prices of comparable properties in the neighbourhood two years ago, according to property agents. The Le Mont project is located in Tai Po.

China Vanke, once the largest real estate developer on the mainland but now battling a liquidity crisis, faced renewed challenges after several banks in Hong Kong rejected mortgage applications from potential buyers of the project. Standard Chartered and Chong Hing Bank were not accepting applications for the project, agents said earlier this week. The banks were assessing the risk of a Vanke default and its capacity to complete the project, according to a lawyer. As of Friday, Hang Seng Bank, HSBC and Bank of East Asia confirmed they would provide mortgage financing for buyers, joining OCBC Hong Kong and Bank of Communications, according to a Vanke spokesman. Bank of China (Hong Kong) and ICBC (Asia) also indicated they would extend mortgages for the project.|2025-03-16|https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-vankes-le-mont-project-093000888.html
WASHINGTON — More than 50 universities — including Montana State — are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of President Donald Trump's campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs that his officials say exclude white and Asian American students. The Education Department announced the new investigations Friday, one month after issuing a memo warning America's schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life. Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the color of their skin, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. We will not yield on this commitment. Most of the new inquiries are focused on colleges' partnerships with the PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from underrepresented groups get degrees in business with the goal of diversifying the business world. Department officials said that the group limits eligibility based on race and that colleges that partner with it are engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programs. The group of 45 colleges facing scrutiny over ties to the PhD Project include major public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and Rutgers, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a statement, the PhD Project said it aims to create a broader talent pipeline of current and future business leaders who are committed to excellence and to each other. This year, we have opened our membership application to anyone who shares that vision, it said. In an email to the Montana Television Network late Friday, MSU Vice President of Communications Tracy Ellig wrote: Montana State University is surprised by the notice it received from the U.S. Department of Education. MSU strictly adheres to all federal and state laws in the hiring of its faculty and staff. Indeed, the following statement is one of the first thing job applicants encounter when seeking a job at MSU: Montana State University is an equal opportunity employer. MSU does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, political ideas, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, marital status, national origin, physical or mental disability, or any other protected class status in violation of any applicable law. In compliance with the Montana Veteran's Employment Preference Act, MSU provides preference in employment to veterans, disabled veterans, and certain eligible relatives of veterans. Ellig added: MSU is unaware of any complaint made internally with regards to the PhD Project. Arizona State said the business school is not financially supporting the PhD Project this year, and on Feb. 20, told faculty that the school would not support travel to the nonprofit's conference. A statement from Ohio State said the university does not discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity or any other protected class, and our PhD programs are open to all qualified applicants. Six other colleges are being investigated for awarding impermissible race-based scholarships, the department said. Those schools are: Grand Valley State University, Ithaca College, the New England College of Optometry, the University of Alabama, the University of South Florida and the University of Oklahoma at Tulsa. An initial press release from the Education Department erroneously identified the University of Tulsa as one of the schools under investigation. Additionally, the University of Minnesota is being investigated for allegedly operating a program that segregates students on the basis of race, the department said. The Feb. 14 memo from Trump's Republican administration was a sweeping expansion of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that barred colleges from using race as a factor in admissions. That decision focused on admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina, but the Education Department said it will interpret the decision to forbid race-based policies in any aspect of education, both in K-12 schools and higher education. In the memo, Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, had said schools' and colleges' diversity, equity and inclusion efforts have been smuggling racial stereotypes and explicit race-consciousness into everyday training, programming and discipline. The memo is being challenged in federal lawsuits from the nation's two largest teachers' unions. The suits say the memo is too vague and violates the free speech rights of educators.

President Trump's approval ratings are showing signs of weakening nearly two months into his second term. While his efforts to crack down on immigration seem largely well-received, Trump's performance on the economy has taken a hit amid whipsawing tariff plans followed by stock market losses. Though it was one of his biggest strengths throughout the 2024 campaign, the public's view of Trump's handling of the economy has started to drag on his overall approval rating. Analysts said it's not a given that Trump's approval will fully drop underwater, but recent historical trends indicate a frustration that sets in with sitting presidents after a grace period. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement This would have been for [former Vice President] Harris, as well, said Scott Tranter, the director of data science for Decision Desk HQ. Ever since 2016, the phenomenon is, it's not a Democrat or Republican thing. [People] just don't like the person in power. Here's what voters think of Trump's job performance on major issues: Overall job approval Trump started his second administration with some of his highest approval ratings of either term, at times receiving majority support, almost completely unseen throughout his first term. A CBS News poll taken just a few weeks into the second term put his approval rating at 53 percent, while a Harvard CAPS/Harris survey found it to be 52 percent at the one-month mark. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But polls with his disapproval rating higher than his approval rating have started to become a bit more common. Trump's approval rating fell lower than his disapproval rating for the first time in his second term in RealClearPolitics's average on Wednesday. The first Gallup poll of Trump's second term put his net job approval at -1 point, but the second one a few weeks later found it to be -6 points. Still, his approval is notably better than where he was at this point in his first term, when he was underwater by more than 5 points on average. Tranter said one major difference is Trump's popular vote victory in 2024, unlike in 2016. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement That has reverberations into the overall approval rating, he said. Still obviously a controversial figure, but he has expanded the people who are going to pretty much like him no matter what. But Trump's approval rating is still lower than most of his predecessors, both upon being sworn in and at this point in his term. Dating back to Harry Truman's administration, every other president started their term with a majority of the country approving of their performance in Gallup polling. The closest to Trump's starting point were Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, with 51 percent. The Hill political editor Chris Stirewalt's weekly average shows Trump standing at 45.6 percent approval and 49.8 percent disapproval, based on an average of several major polls. His net approval is –4.2 points, which is 1.2 points lower than last week. Economy Polls along the campaign trail last year showed Americans largely bought into Trump's promises to fix the economy, with many trusting him to handle the issues better than Harris. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But shortly into his second term in office, the polls signal frustration over steep losses in the stock market and a potential trade war with some of America's closest allies. You're looking at the first real indicator of negativity in terms of the Wall Street move, primarily coming from a demographic that's a Trump-based demographic, which are men with money, and there's been a lot of anxiety and selling pressure in the stock market over the last week, said David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. An Emerson College Polling survey released this week found nearly half, or 48 percent, of voters disapproved of Trump's job performance on the economy. A new CNN poll found that disapproval figure even higher, at 56 percent. Half of respondents in the CNN poll also said Trump's policies have worsened the country's economic conditions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement And polling from the Economist/YouGov found Trump's approval on jobs and the economy ticked down from 49 percent to 43 percent between late January and early March, while his approval on inflation dropped from 45 percent to 38 percent. The latest numbers are a blight for Trump as the White House continues to pledge to turn back the economic plague unleashed by the Biden Administration. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are worried that Trump's tariff plans are hurting the economy, and voicing concern about downturns in the stock market. Immigration Since returning to the Oval, Trump has kicked off mass deportations and worked to end birthright citizenship as part of a major crackdown on immigration. Like the economy, immigration was a top issue for Trump supporters during the 2024 race, as he railed against the Biden administration's border actions. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement In a Pew Research survey taken shortly after Trump's inauguration, 59 percent of U.S. adults said they approved of the administration ramping up deportations, and 58 percent approved of sending additional military to the southern border. CNN found 51 percent approved of his handling of immigration, his highest positive rating among a range of issue areas tested. Emerson found Trump performed best on immigration, at 48 percent approval. Gallup polling from February also found that Trump's approval on immigration, at 46 percent, was higher than his overall job approval, at 45 percent. Though his support from Democrats on immigration was in the single digits, he scored a notable 40 percent approval from independents, the highest of a half-dozen issues tested. Ukraine war Previous widespread bipartisan support for continued U.S. aid to Ukraine has given way to division on the best path forward. But an increasing number of voters say they want the war to end through negotiations, a position Trump has vocally supported. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement But as the war lingers, that hasn't translated into support for his handling of the conflict. A Quinnipiac poll found 55 percent disapprove of how Trump is handling the war, while just 38 percent approve. Trump, who has repeatedly claimed that Russia's war on Ukraine would not have happened on his watch, controversially paused U.S. military and intelligence assistance to Kyiv and clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a meeting at the White House. Nearly 6 in 10 voters in new Quinnipiac polling disapproved of the way Trump handled that meeting, and more than 6 in 10 said that supporting Ukraine is in the national interest. Roughly half thought Trump is too tough on Ukraine, and just 2 percent said he's too tough on Russia. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement An Economist/YouGov poll also found that while 46 percent of U.S. adults thought Zelensky wasn't disrespectful at that meeting, as Vice President Vance had suggested, 51 percent said Trump was the one who showed disrespect. Tranter said voters may give Trump a longer leash to end the war because it's not as critical as reducing costs, but they want to see it done. He said it on his campaign, I'm going to solve it. So… all this back and forth, all these talks, not solving it, that's a pretty black and white thing. Tariffs After months of threats, Trump imposed 25 percent tariffs this month against Canada and Mexico, marking a turning point in the relationship between the U.S. and two of its top trading partners. Days later, he added exemptions for most imports from those countries, delaying tariff implementation until early April. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Trump's plans have been met with sharp pushback from world leaders and the looming threats are having economic impacts in the U.S. and beyond. More than half of voters in the Quinnipiac survey, or 55 percent, think Trump is being too tough on Canada. Icy exchanges on tariffs chill a longstanding friendship and voters make it clear they feel that's no way to treat our neighbors to the north, said Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy in a release. The CNN polling found Trump with just a 39 percent approval rating on tariffs. The Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.|2025-03-16|https://www.yahoo.com/news/where-trump-approval-rating-stands-210000312.html

🎨 Concept Overhaul & Game Vision After the presentation, I knew I had to step up. I went all in on creating concept sketches for the entire gameplay, laying out mechanics, environments, and key interactions. The goal? To ensure everyone team, professors, and future players can see the heart of our game. Concept 3 Despite the rough start, my team had my back. They reminded me that this is just one hurdle in a long journey. That moment reaffirmed that an incredible group of people surrounds me, and I refuse to let them down. Concept 14 💻 Programming: Hidden Mechanics & Mini-Game Milestones In the coding department, things are rolling along smoothly. We made huge strides in implementing a hidden mechanic (more on that later—secrets are fun!) and, to my surprise, most of the minigames now have their core methods working! That was an unexpected but very welcome win. 👩‍🎨 Art Department: Animation in Motion The art team is deep in animation work, focusing on both our protagonist and the guards. We're combining bone animation with frame-by-frame drawn sequences to strike the right balance between fluidity and style. Seeing the character come to life has been incredibly rewarding. 💪 The End of the Week: A Win in Disguise By the week's end, I was able to fully lay out the game's core concept in a way that finally clicked. Though I can't share everything just yet (gotta keep some mystery!), my professors seemed satisfied. That validation, combined with my team being on the same page, gave me the reassurance that we're all running toward the same goal. Concept 5 The grind continues, and next week, we tackle even more challenges. Will we have another redesign? Probably. Will it be worth it? Absolutely. Onward!

SHERMAN COUNTY, Kan. (KWCH) - 4:45 p.m. update: KHP is now reporting that over 70 vehicles were involved in the pileup. 2:15 p.m. update: At least eight people died in the crash, Trooper Tod with the Kansas Highway Patrol confirmed Saturday afternoon. KHP set up a phone number for family members searching for loved ones who were involved in the crash, which is 785-827-4437. I-70 remains closed as crews continue to investigate and clean up the crash. A pileup involving dozens of vehicles resulted in multiple fatalities Friday afternoon and has shut down both eastbound and westbound lanes of I-70 between Goodland and Colby. According to Goodland Fire Chief Brian James, Kansas Highway Patrol and about 10 other agencies are still working the scene Saturday after extreme winds led to blowing dust and zero visibility Friday afternoon. James said over 55 vehicles were involved in the pileup between mile marker 28 and 29, with more than 30 patients taken to nearby hospitals and an unknown number of deaths. We had to think outside the box to get patients transported to hospitals in Goodland and Colby by using our fire department support vehicle with AEMTs in the back, to using patrol vehicles from Goodland Police Department, Sherman County Sheriff's Office and Kansas Highway Patrol, James said. I'm sorry for the lives lost in this incident, but I'm grateful for the ones we could save. James said Goodland and Brewster firefighters are returning to the crash site Saturday to cut deceased people out of their vehicles. The Thomas County Commission declared a State of Local Emergency in response to the crash. The American Red Cross has established a shelter for those in need. The shelter is located atColby Community College (Steve Lampe Athletic Center), 1255 S. Range Ave. KHP said the stretch of I-70 between Goodland and Colby will remain closed for an extended period of time.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/least-8-dead-over-55-vehicles-involved-pileup-i-70/
Six Americans who were imprisoned in Kuwait have been released in an agreement with the United States, a representative for their families confirmed to ABC News. The Americans, many of whom are veterans and former military contractors, were convicted on drug charges, Jonathan Franks, a crisis management consultant, said. For years, however, the prisoners have vigorously maintained their innocence, Franks said. Several more prisoners are expected to be freed in the coming weeks as part of the agreement, Franks added. This morning, the Kuwaiti government released six of my clients as part of an agreement that will ultimately free fifteen of my clients in short order. Each was convicted on drug charges, and each vigorously maintains their innocence, Franks said. Convictions for possession of drugs in Kuwait may include long jail sentences or the death penalty, according to an advisory by the U.S. State Department. According to the U.S. Embassy of Kuwait website, American citizens are subject to Kuwait's laws and regulations. Those laws can differ significantly from those in the United States, and the U.S. government may only be able to offer limited assistance to those charged, the website says. Kuwait is a small Middle Eastern country borders Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The prisoners' release comes amid President Donald Trump's emphasis on freeing Americans held abroad. President Trump has made it a priority to bring home Americans detained overseas. We are pleased that Kuwait released Americans from prison, a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to ABC News. Kuwait is a vital ally in the region, and we look forward to continuing to work with Kuwait and other partners in these efforts across the world, the spokesperson added. In February, three prisoners, including an unnamed American and a journalist dubbed a political prisoner, were released from Belarus.|2025-03-16|https://abcnews.go.com/International/6-american-prisoners-kuwait-released-land-back-us/story?id=119716730
Denmark's Holger Rune beat Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-4 to reach the Indian Wells ATP Masters final on Saturday, denying the Russian world number six a third straight trip to the title match. Rune, ranked 13th, snapped a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals and will face either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Britain's Jack Draper on Sunday. It means everything, Rune said. The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing. Playing Daniil is one of the toughest challenges for me on tour. I obviously had the right tactics, but it was still so difficult because he puts in great effort and is super solid. In a rematch of last year's quarter-finals, the 21-year-old Rune showed admirable discipline against the Medvedev's vaunted defense, sticking in the rallies and keeping the Russian off balance with a variety of shots while making judicious use of his powerful forehand. After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes. He gained the decisive break for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev. The second set was a more straightforward affair after Rune broke Medvedev at love for a 2-1 lead. After two nervy points as he served for the match, Rune rallied from 0-30 down and survived another mammoth rally to give himself a match point, punctuating the victory with a forehand winner. It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got good leg work, so I can reach many balls, Rune said. It's about finding the right pace and which shots to hit, because so many players miss too many shots against Daniil. He makes you go for more, so I'm super proud that I managed to find the right rhythm. Rune, whose ascent has slowed since he burst on the scene in 2022 with a victory over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final, reached his first tour-level final since Brisbane in January of 2024. bb/sev|2025-03-16|https://www.thedigitalcourier.com/news/national/rune-shocks-medvedev-to-reach-indian-wells-atp-final/article_bcf76443-907f-5f24-b829-01bb587249af.html
Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Wes Streeting suggested hundreds more quangos could be in the firing line after the Prime Minister announced the end of the body overseeing the health service in England. He said: The abolition of NHS England – the world's largest quango – is the beginning, not the end. Patients and staff alike can see the inefficiency and waste in the health service. My team and I are going through budgets line by line, with a relentless focus on slashing bloated bureaucracy. NHS England has managed the health service since 2012, when it was established to cut down on political interference in the NHS – something Mr Streeting described as an act of backside-covering to avoid blame for failures. Sir Keir Starmer delivers a speech announcing the abolition of NHS England / Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer visit to Yorkshire / Sir Keir Starmer announced the abolition of NHS England in a surprise move on Thursday (Oli Scarff/PA) But on Thursday, Sir Keir Starmer announced this would come to an end as he unexpectedly revealed the Government would abolish NHS England in an effort to avoid duplication . In his Sunday Telegraph article, Mr Streeting suggested more was to come, saying new NHS England chair Penny Dash had identified hundreds of bodies cluttering the patient safety and regulatory landscape, leaving patients and staff alike lost in a labyrinth of paperwork and frustration . The move towards scrapping NHS England and other health-related quangos marks a change in direction for Mr Streeting, who in January of this year said he would not embark upon a reorganisation of the NHS. He told the Health Service Journal he could spend a hell of a lot of time on reorganisation and not make a single difference to the patient interest , saying instead he would focus on trying to eliminate waste and duplication . But in the Sunday Telegraph, he said he had heard former Conservative health ministers bemoan not abolishing NHS England, adding: If we hadn't acted this week, the transformational reform the NHS needs wouldn't have been possible. The Government expects scrapping NHS England will take two years and save hundreds of millions of pounds that can be spent on frontline services. But during the week, Downing Street would not be drawn on how many people were facing redundancy as a result of the changes.|2025-03-16|https://www.chardandilminsternews.co.uk/news/national/25011411.quangos-firing-line-nhs-england-scrapped---streeting/

WASHINGTON — (AP) — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.

Tied for fourth place in the Eastern Conference, the Indiana Pacers and Bucks look for another moment when they meet in Milwaukee on Saturday night. It will be the fourth — and final — regular-season meeting between the two teams who are each 37-28. The two teams met on Tuesday with the Pacers winning on an incredible four-point play by All-Star guard Tyrese Haliburton with 3.4 seconds left. After that shot, Haliburton was asked about the parallel to the late-game heroics by Pacers legend Reggie Miller. There's definitely a lot of Reggie moments in this building, Haliburton said. And you know, I'm just trying to create some of my own. A big part of being a representative of this organization is that I follow in the footsteps of a lot of greats. And, you know, [I'm] trying to create my own path behind that … Just trying to create my own moments so that the same way that kids and fans looked up to him when he was here, they can look at me the same way. Haliburton had 14 points in the Pacers 112-100 win in Philadelphia Friday night. The short-handed Sixers led by as many as 16 points before Indiana surged in the second half. Pascal Siakam, who was questionable before the game with a bad elbow, had 27 points in the win. I can come up with a lot of reasons why we had a slow start. Nobody wants to hear it, Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. We need to compete better right off the bat to start the game. The second half was how we needed to play. Milwaukee ended a three-game losing streak Thursday night over the LeBron-less Lakers. Giannis Antetokounmpo played only 30 minutes in the win and had 24 points. He remains the NBA's second leading scorer behind Shai Gilgeous-Alexander at 30.5 points a game. We're a veteran team, said Damian Lillard, who had 22 against the Lakers. You have to be able to move on from those moments where it's like âman, if we would've done this or we would've done that then we win for sure two out of those three games.' But I think we showed our maturity. We showed what a veteran team should show. Brook Lopez has put up two big games in a row, scoring 23 in each. He's 17-20 from the field in his last two contests. Brook has been playing really well, Bucks coach Doc Rivers said. We got him in a great place right now, he defends the basket as well as anybody in the league. Antetokounmpo, who committed the foul on Haliburton's four-point play, has averaged only 24.5 in his career against Indiana. For Milwaukee, it's been a season with adversity. The team started 2-8, and is without Bobby Portis who has been suspended for using an illegal medication until April 8. When we move the ball, it's hard to guard us, Rivers said. We have so much shooting on the floor. We have great cutters, when we do that consistently…we had 20-plus assists tonight. We will take that every night. The Bucks are 8-4 since the All-Star break and 23-11 this season at Fiserv Forum. Indiana is 4-6 in back-to-back games this season. Milwaukee leads the season series 2-1.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/tyrese-haliburton-eyes-another-reggie-moment-as-pacers-visit-bucks/
- Advertisement - By Dr Desryn T. A. Collins In the world of 2025, a time marked by an unprecedented conflagration of superlative developments, the ability to read, write, and think critically is not merely an essential skill – it is a powerful tool for fostering integrity, empathy, and respect in society. In recent times, Antigua and Barbuda, like many other nations, has faced challenges related to misinformation, social conflicts, abuse of authority and a growing need for ethical leadership. This year, the theme for the National Literacy Festival: Promoting Responsible Expression: Literacy for Integrity, Empathy, and Respectspeaks directly to these issues. While we continue to blaze the literacy trail, encouraging consistent attention to the importance of literacy and investment in programmes that safeguard the literacy development of all citizens, we must also ignite a passion for communication that is characterised by integrity, empathy and respect. Literacy is the foundation of personal success and national prosperity. It is universally acknowledged that students who read at or above their grade level perform better academically. Those students whose names populate Principals' Lists and Honour Rolls are good readers, often avid readers. Students must develop the skills to negotiate texts from all genres, particularly informational texts if they are to excel at school and secure success beyond the classroom. The importance of literacy, though, extends far beyond the classroom. The recent report from the World Bank which contends that the education system in the Caribbean is in crisis also predicts a dismal future for the region if the current trend is not reversed. Notwithstanding the fact that the very World Bank claims the literacy level in Antigua and Barbuda is 99%, that report should not be disregarded. Neither can we ignore the data from our National Assessments and the performance of our students at the CSEC examinations. If unsatisfactory exam performance points to literacy challenges, then we have a serious issue. A literate society is a productive society. The converse is also true. Individuals with strong literacy skills are more likely to secure meaningful employment, contribute to economic growth, and participate actively in community and national affairs. Countries with high literacy rates tend to have lower crime rates, better healthcare outcomes, and stronger democratic institutions. We should never underestimate the value of literacy. Unfortunately, we often separate our efforts to advance personally from our responsibility to each other. We strive for economic prosperity while we set flames to social harmony. Yet, literacy should facilitate effective interaction and communication, the essence of social harmony. True literacy should awaken us to our responsibility to interact with each other and communicate with integrity, empathy and respect. When we interact with integrity, we prioritise moral uprightness, we make a distinction between truth and falsehood and we do not participate in the spreading of fake news. Empathy ensures that people understand and respect different viewpoints, promoting unity rather than division. None of us can doubt the need for a higher level of empathy in our society. Respect, too, is sadly lacking in many of our interactions and in how we communicate. When we respect each other, we treat each other with consideration, and we have regard for the viewpoints of others even when we disagree. We never insult, slander or shame our fellowmen. Yes! We must express ourselves as literate people; but, we must do so with respect, with empathy and with integrity. This year, we want to refocus the nation's attention to these values as essential elements of a progressive and inclusive society. As we celebrate National Literacy Festival in our schools, and as Antigua and Barbuda continues on a path of development, every citizen must recognise that literacy is a shared responsibility. Schools play a fundamental role in teaching reading and writing, but the process must be reinforced at home and in the community. Parents, guardians, and community leaders must foster a culture where children and adults alike see literacy as a lifelong skill that opens doors to knowledge, opportunity, and civic engagement. All sectors of society must actively participate in the push to advance literacy and promote integrity, empathy and respect in the way we interact with each other. We must build a society in which every man, woman and child thinks critically, communicates effectively, and engages responsibly with the world.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/promoting-responsible-expression-literacy-for-integrity-empathy-and-respect/
/ Contributor via Getty Images Image Alt Lil Yachty Image Size landscape-medium Image Position center Lil Yachty's comments about Black Lives Matter being literally a scam clearly didn't go unnoticed, and the organization came back swinging. In a statement responding to his remarks on a March 2 episode of Quenlin Blackwell's Feeding Starving Celebrities, they accused the rapper of drinking the white supremacist ideology Kool-Aid. His comments are wrong, BLM told FOX News in a relatively lengthy statement earlier in the week. They are misinformed, unoriginal, and crafted to please the same people who profit from Black suffering. The real scam isn't Black Lives Matter. It is watching Black artists with massive platforms recycle the same tired attacks on Black movements while ignoring the actual systems killing us, they continued. Black Lives Matter has supported Black families who have lost loved ones to police violence. We have built programs, funded mutual aid, and fought in courtrooms and on the streets to protect our people. Lil Yachty's Comments On Quenlin Blackwell's Feeding Starving Celebrities They had bought mansions, and you probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about Black people and don't follow Black news, Lil Yachty told Blackwell during the airing. While it's true that the organization purchased a 6,500-square-foot California property for $6 million in 2020, the space, according to AP News, was intended as a refuge for those grieving loved ones killed in incidents of police violence. As for his other claims, the One Night artist might want to bring some actual evidence next time — let alone pick a more fitting platform to make them — before taking aim at the movement again. Controversy aside, Lil Yachty's Feeding Starving Celebrities was arguably one of the most entertaining we've gotten so far, largely due to his long history with Blackwell. The two chopped it up about dating, fashion, and more, all while cooking up a bizarre spread that included chicken tenders coated with Flamin' Hot Cheetos, scrambled pancakes, and orange juice, among other dishes.|2025-03-16|https://www.rap-up.com/article/black-lives-matter-checks-misinformed-lil-yachty-after-his-scam-comments
TOPEKA, Kan. (KCTV) - Federal aid is headed to the Sunflower State to help Kansans recover from the devastation of persisting grassland fires. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management has announced that crews continue to monitor and provide resources to counties that progress in battles against wildland fires. As a result, the Division said it requested a Fire Management Assistance Grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency as multiple fires threatened Kansas towns. The fire near Yates Center in Woodson Co. was found to be a major disaster and led to the request's approval on Friday, March 14. According to agency leaders, the grant provides a 75% federal cost share. It is available to states, local and tribal governments, to mitigate, manage and control fires on publicly or privately owned forests and grasslands. The destruction is required to constitute a major disaster. Kansas Governor Laura Kelly verbally declared a disaster emergency on Thursday due to continued dry conditions that affect much of the Sunflower State. The State Emergency Operations Center in Topeka was activated with partners to provide support to county and local responders. Agency officials noted that a combination of strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures continue to contribute to extreme fire risk. Any sparks that develop could quickly spread and become very difficult to control.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/federal-aid-approved-help-kansans-recover-devastating-grass-fires/

The Los Angeles Dodgers are currently in Japan preparing to kick off their season. As expected, this is adding significant mileage to an already arduous MLB regular season grind. More news: Mookie Betts At Risk of Missing Dodgers vs Cubs Tokyo Series in Japan When it comes to where the Dodgers rank in terms of total mileage added up for the 2025 regular season, a new study by New Jersey Bet was able to identify the exact number. This is a rare instance where the Dodgers rank at the top of the league in a category, but fans shouldn't be thrilled with it. With 55,893 miles to travel in 2025, L.A. has been given the worst travel schedule in the league. Although many of those miles are due to the Tokyo Series, that number is 12,741 more miles than last season. The report indicated that the West Coast teams will carry a brunt of the worst travel schedules as the teams that follow the Dodgers are the Athletics, San Diego Padres, Seattle Mariners, San Francisco Giants, and the Los Angeles Angels. As for the average of all teams, it is only 761 more miles per average road trip, but L.A. certainly has the disadvantage here. Not to mention, last season was also started overseas as Seoul, South Korea was where the Dodgers opened up 2024. Regardless, the step up from last year's miles to this current season is 12,741 miles. The defending champions will surely be tested on the road in 2025. Last year, the Dodgers were 52-29 at home and 46-35 on the road. With the significant increase in mileage, it will be interesting to note what the Dodgers' record is at the end of the season and if players comment on travel fatigue throughout the year. The excitement for 2025 has been building all season long, and the quest to becoming baseball's first back-to-back champions in a quarter-century begins Wednesday, March 18 against the Chicago Cubs at the Tokyo Dome.

MEXICO CITY: A group of volunteers searching for missing relatives first received a tip last week about a mass grave hidden in western Mexico. When they arrived at an abandoned ranch outside La Estanzuela, a small rural village outside Guadalajara, they discovered three underground cremation ovens, burned human remains, hundreds of bone shards and discarded personal items, and figurines of Santa Muerte - the Holy Death. The Mexican authorities, who were notified of the grisly discovery, said in several statements that they later found 96 shell casings of various calibers and metal gripping rings at the ranch. By last Friday, the discovery was dominating local newspapers and TV reports, and the search group was referring to the site as an extermination camp. It is unclear how many people died on the site, and none of remains have been identified. The authorities have yet to say who operated the camp, what crimes were committed there and for how long. But this week, the attorney general's office took over the investigation at the request of President Claudia Sheinbaum. Photos taken by authorities and by the volunteer group, Searching Warriors of Jalisco, at the abandoned ranch showed over 200 shoes piled together and heaps of other personal items: a blue summer dress, a small pink backpack, notebooks, pieces of underwear. The more than 700 personal items were a chilling hint about the number of people who may have died there. In a country seemingly inured to episodes of brutal violence from drug cartels, where clandestine graves emerge every month, the images shocked Mexicans and prompted outraged human rights groups to demand that the govt put an end to the violence. Over 120,000 people have been forcibly disappeared in Mexico since record-keeping began in 1962. Human rights groups and collectives of volunteers in search of missing relatives have warned that the number could be higher. The discovery at the ranch comes at a time where Sheinbaum faces intense pressure from President Donald Trump to crack down on organised crime. Partly because of his threats, Sheinbaum has shifted security issues back to centrestage on her agenda. But her govt faces significant challenges. One of the most violent criminal organisations in Mexico, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which emerged in the early 2010s, is now a major producer and trafficker of synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl and methamphetamine. The group, which operates in the state of Jalisco and across the country, has diversified into other criminal activities like illegal logging, human trafficking and extortion.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/at-mexico-extermination-camp-pile-of-200-shoes-found/articleshow/119060880.cms

Lunar the cat was left in pain for hours in a steel trap and had to have one of her toes amputated. Photo: HANDOUT/RSPCA SA Lunar the cat was left in pain for hours in a steel trap and had to have one of her toes amputated. Photo: HANDOUT/RSPCA SA Steel-jaw traps should be turned into scrap metal as there is no good reason to own the barbaric devices , Australia's leading animal protection group says. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading The call comes after a man was convicted in an Adelaide court for using the trap in his backyard to catch his neighbour's four-year-old cat, Lunar. The 71-year-old admitted to police he was aware she was in the trap for about two hours but left her meowing in pain , RSPCA South Australia said in a statement on Sunday. A man used brickwork next to his fence to funnel his neighbour's cat into a steel-jaw trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) A man used brickwork next to his fence to funnel his neighbour's cat into a steel-jaw trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) After the injured cat was freed, an RSPCA inspector and police attended the man's property to find the steel-jaw trap had been reset. It had been set next to a hole in a fence and surrounded by brickwork, funnelling cats entering through the hole to walk directly into the trap. These are barbaric devices that inflict terrible injuries and cause enormous suffering, RSPCA SA Chief Inspector Andrew Baker said. It's tragic to think that some animals could become trapped and never found, leaving them to die in agony. One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) Mr Baker hoped the prosecution of the man, convicted of animal cruelty and setting a steel-jaw trap, would deter others from using them. From RSPCA's perspective, there's no good reason to own a steel-jaw trap, he said. We encourage anyone who has one to turn it into scrap metal so that there is no possibility of it ever falling into the hands of a person who wants to harm animals. According to the RSPCA, the man was placed on a six-month good behaviour bond on Friday and ordered to pay Lunar's vet costs, exceeding $4000.

(AP) — Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that killed at least 18 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. EN ESPAÑOL: Lo último sobre el sistema de poderosas tormentas que ha causado muerte y destrucción en varios estados It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls.

Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said. Officials in Arkansas said on Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. In the meantime, I just released $250,000 from our Disaster Recovery fund to provide resources for this operation for each of the impacted communities. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma due to fire. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (about 69 hectares) have burned so far in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. This is terrible out here, said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes, some of which could be long-track and violent, are expected Saturday afternoon and evening. The region at highest risk stretches from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi in the afternoon and then Alabama and western portions of Georgia and the Florida panhandle in the evening, the Center said. Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Apart from Oklahoma, wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 260,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according the website poweroutage.us. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. ___ Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey. Walker reported from New York.

A new Mario Kart game for the Nintendo Switch 2 was revealed alongside the console back in January. Based on this reveal, the current expectation is that the new Mario Kart game is the big Nintendo Switch 2 launch game set to release with the console. A recent report claims this isn't true though. More specifically, the report claims that the new Mario Kart game will not be a Nintendo Switch 2 launch game. Videos by ComicBook.com The report comes the way of Nintendo insider Samus Hunter on X, a source that has proven reliable in the past. The insider does not say much about the new Mario Kart game, such as when it will release, but they note it will not be available at the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Considering it was the one and only game revealed alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 it would be surprising to see the new Mario Kart not available at the release of the console. However, Nintendo may be looking to repeat what it did with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, which injected huge life into the Nintendo Switch back in 2017 a month after the console launched. This gave the Nintendo Switch a second major release after the launch window, in a quick turn around, and proved successful for the game as well as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe went on to sell like hotcakes. All of that said, take this new information with a grain of salt, especially since it bucks expectation so hard. The source in question has proven reputable in the past, but this is still very much unofficial information. And so far Nintendo has not commented on it. Considering it never comments on rumors, and considering it's not going to disclose information about the release of this new Mario Kart, we don't expect this to change. If it does comment though we will be sure to update the story accordingly.

WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. The video in the player above is from a previous report. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets.|2025-03-16|https://abc7chicago.com/post/president-donald-trump-invokes-wartime-alien-enemies-act-1798-declare-invasion-gangs-speed-deportations/16028956/

President Donald Trump announced that he's ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen in a post shared on his Truth Social account Saturday (March 15). Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote. The president then directly threatened the Houthi rebels, writing, YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he added, while also warning Iran to cease its support of the group immediately. Trump also took aim at former President Joe Biden's past handling of the Houthi rebels following their attack on American warships in the Red Sea. Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden, he wrote. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.|2025-03-16|https://wflanews.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-trump-orders-powerful-airstrike-attack/

The Canadian government is considering canceling its contract with U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin in light of the imposed tariffs by the Trump administration, the CBC reported. In June 2023, Canada signed a $19 billion contract to purchase 88 of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. But the Canadian government is looking for alternatives to their air defense in response to the ongoing tariff war and President Donald Trump's repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Canada has already paid for 16 of the aircraft and is weary about supporting and maintaining a mixed fleet of fighter jets that would require their own unique training, hangers, infrastructure, and supply chain, all of which would increase cost. The first shipment of F-35s is scheduled to be delivered early in 2026. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Ronald Ray Longerbeam Marion Ronald (Ron, Ronnie) Ray Longerbeam, a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend, left this world on March 6, 2025, at the age of 78, after a sudden illness. Born on August 5, 1946, in Iowa City, Iowa, Ron was the beloved son of Seward W. Longerbeam and Inez Mickey D. (Dillon) Longerbeam, who both preceded him in death. Ron was a man of many passions and interests, known for his strong yet gentle spirit and a heart that embraced all those he encountered. He dedicated his life to his family, whom he adored deeply. He is survived by his loving wife, Joyce M. (Sigwarth) Longerbeam, their daughter, Chelsea Longerbeam, Grandson Caleb, and daughter, Carey (Joe) Snitker, and grandsons, Connor, Cody, and Cole. Ron attended high school and went on to have a fulfilling career as a heavy equipment operator and professional driver. Ron married the love of his life, Joyce on December 27th, 1980, at St Patrick's Church, Cedar Rapids, IA. His work ethic was as strong as his love for the outdoors, particularly during his cherished walleye fishing trips, which were often enjoyed with an ice-cold Old Style in hand. An avid motorcyclist, Ron took great pride in his Harley Davidson, especially his treasured Panhead and Ultra Classic. Life was an adventure for Ron, epitomized by a memorable road trip he took to celebrate his 60's, riding across the country to California and crossing the Golden Gate Bridge with his daughter Chelsea, a memory they both held dear. In addition to his love for family and the open road, Ron was a passionate fan of the Iowa Hawkeyes, the Chicago Cubs, and Da Bears. He often filled the air with the sounds of Lynyrd Skynyrd, ZZ Top, and other rock legends, reflecting his vibrant personality and zest for life. Ron's friends, many of whom he had known since childhood, were a testament to his warm and inviting nature. He had an uncanny ability to connect with people, always ready to lend a helping hand or offer advice—often with a humorous quip about what they were up to. Ron served in the United States Navy, a chapter of his life that he approached with pride and dedication. His commitment to service extended beyond his military years into the love and care he provided to his family and friends. The family expresses their heartfelt gratitude to the nurses and staff at the University of Iowa Hospital for their compassionate care and support for Ron and his family. A celebration of Ron's life will be held at a later date, where family and friends will come together to honor a man whose legacy of love, laughter, and unwavering support will forever remain in their hearts. Ron Longerbeam was not just a man; he was a force of nature, a loving patriarch, and a steadfast friend, leaving behind a world that was undoubtedly brighter for having known him.|2025-03-16|https://www.thegazette.com/obituaries/ronald-ray-longerbeam/
A Canadian comedian's joke about blocking U.S. access to Pornhub as a retaliatory measure in the ongoing trade dispute has sparked debate, with some calling it Canada's nuclear weapon in jest, the New York Post reported. A viral joke about banning American access to Canadian-owned Pornhub has emerged as an unconventional take on the ongoing trade war between the United States and Canada. The idea, introduced by Toronto-based comedian Matthew Puzhitsky, has gained traction online, with some supporters calling it a peaceful yet powerful form of retaliation. If Canada could ban Pornhub in the states, we [would] win the trade war. That's it. There is no trade war, Puzhitsky told The Post. His Instagram video promoting the idea has since gone viral, fueling conversations on both sides of the border about the potential impact of such a move. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Yuri Cordero: 'Univision never asked me to hide my faith' (exclusive) Vice president and executive producer of 'Primer Impacto' shares her faith journey, mission of empowerment at Highgrace By Javier Bolanos, Editor for Latin America of Diario Cristiano Wednesday, March 12, 2025 With nearly three decades in television and five Emmy nominations, Yuri Cordero is a leading figure in Hispanic media, setting trends and leading with innovation. / yuricordero.com Yuri Cordero, one of the most influential figures in Hispanic television, has dedicated more than 27 years to the Univision network, establishing herself as vice president and executive producer of the iconic program Primer Impacto, one of the longest-running programs on Hispanic television in the United States. Cordero is also the author of The Virtue of Process and founder of High Grace, a mentoring and personal development platform. In a recent interview with Christian Post Español, Cordero spoke about her faith journey, the challenges of working in secular media, and her mission to empower the Hispanic community. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Faith as a pillar in a secular environment Despite the pressures that often exist in secular media, Cordero has found a respectful and supportive environment at Univision. They've never told me not to talk about my faith or participate in conferences. On the contrary, they've always supported me, she said. However, she acknowledges that not all Christians in the media have the same experience, and encourages those who feel pressure to hide their beliefs to stand firm. If others don't hide who they are, neither will I. The Bible says I am not ashamed of the Gospel, she emphasized. Cordero has found creative ways to share her faith at work. One example is a box filled with Bible verses in her office where anyone can pick up an encouraging message. People think it's chocolate, but when they find out what it is, many come back looking for more, she said with a laugh. Cancer trial and its spiritual transformation In 2018, after covering the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at St. George's Chapel in Windsor. England, Cordero experienced a radical change in her life when she began attending a Christian church. It was very practical, more grounded language, and that touched my heart, she recalled. However, shortly after, she was diagnosed with cancer, an ordeal that, instead of distancing her from her faith, strengthened it. God had prepared me before cancer. Instead of asking myself 'Why me?' I understood that it was part of a larger plan, she shared. Facing the illness while working at Univisión wasn't easy. Very few people knew about my diagnosis because I didn't want them to treat me differently or feel sorry for me, she explained. Despite the fear and uncertainty, her faith sustained her, and she managed to overcome the illness. Highgrace: Empowering the Hispanic Community As part of her leadership mission, Cordero founded Highgrace, a space dedicated to providing mentorship and leadership training. Highgrace is named after my grandmother, Altagracia, who was the first to instill in me a love for God, she explained. Through this platform, she offers bootcamps and conferences on purposeful living and effective leadership. Knowledge gives authority, and leadership requires consistency and execution, she noted. In her role at Univision, Cordero has witnessed firsthand the challenges facing the Hispanic community, especially regarding immigration issues. Many families have been in this country for decades and have contributed enormously. Their cases cannot be simply ignored, she said. As a Christian, she emphasizes the importance of balancing respect for the law with the commandment to love one's neighbor. We are not here to judge, but to show love and support, she added. A personal miracle: The aneurysm test In 2023, Cordero faced another ordeal when she was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm. It was a very scary time because I couldn't get upset or maintain the pace of life I was living, she confessed. However, her faith once again became her refuge. After a successful surgery in January, she experienced a moment she considers a divine sign: The next thing I knew, I was in room 12, a number with great biblical symbolism. I felt God confirming to me that everything was under His control.|2025-03-16|https://www.christianpost.com:443/news/yuri-cordero-univision-never-asked-me-to-hide-my-faith-exclus.html

(Photo courtesy of OnScene.TV) Crews continued to work on repairs Saturday after a water main break on Graham Terrace left many area residents without water. Officials with the Padre Dam Municipal Water District expect service to be restored by approximately 5 p.m., according to the agency's online outage map. The break began on Graham at Mesa Road. According to OnScene.TV, as the water flow increased at 6 a.m., sinkholes began to form. Hundreds of residents will be affected, according to the report, with road closures in effect in addition to a lack of water service. A San Diego County Sheriff's deputy, though, was able to contact one resident, the owner of a car that was above one of the forming sinkholes. The driver was able to move the vehicle in time.|2025-03-16|https://timesofsandiego.com/life/2025/03/15/water-shut-off-in-santee-neighborhood-for-hours-following-water-main-break/
Win McNamee/Getty Images (WASHINGTON) — Following the Department of Education's gutting of nearly 50% of its workforce Tuesday evening, educators have expressed deep concern — not only for students' futures but for their own as well. Tara Kini, chief of policy and programs at the Learning Policy Institute, told ABC News on Friday the job cuts will have huge impacts on teachers. She pointed to the loss of federal money that previously funded teacher training programs as particularly devastating, especially for programs for teachers of special needs, marginalized and multilingual students. The fact that those grants will be able to go out the door means that we're going to have fewer teachers trained, particularly for high-need subject areas where there are shortages all over the country, she said. We will lose counselors, social workers, behavior specialists — people who ensure safety and stability for students who need it most, Robert Castleberry, a fifth grade teacher in Kansas and the American Federation of Teachers' Kansas secretary, said in a statement to ABC News. I hope this change by the government doesn't set educators back years while our states are working to try and figure out how to distribute all those funds, said Michael Brix, an instructor at the Peoria Public Schools' Woodruff Career and Technical Center in Illinois and a member of the Peoria Federation of Teachers. ​As President Donald Trump is expected to sign an executive order proposing to return education power to states, senior Department of Education officials stressed the massive reforms on Tuesday are going to help the department get funding to states in a more cost-efficient way. What we are doing now is not working, the officials said. It's just not, so it's time for change and that's what's starting tonight. But Kini said the cuts this will exacerbate preexisting issues of teacher shortages and lack of funding that has already been prevalent in America. Our schools are already grossly underfunded in Connecticut, said Jennifer Graves, special education teacher in New Haven, Connecticut, and vice president of New Haven Federation of Teachers. We are really, really struggling already and constantly working in a deficit model to support not only general education students but especially our most vulnerable populations — our multilingual learners and our students with disabilities. As a result, teachers could become more overworked and struggle to accommodate student demands, with Kini speculating that classes could get combined and offer less individualized attention. Or they may cut some courses like electives altogether because they don't have teachers to teach it, she continued. They may staff classes with substitute teachers or long-term substitute teachers … who aren't trained for the job, and none of those options are good for student learning. Mike Carvella, a third grade math and science teacher in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, told ABC News during a rally on Friday how students with individualized education plans, or IEPs, can be denied by private schools, causing them to flood the public school system and subsequently affect teachers. That's going to put more kids with IEPs into more underfunded public schools and put more pressure on public school teachers and public school districts to educate kids who are already marginalized and already have learning problems, he said. Kini noted the coronavirus pandemic in which teachers faced shortages and were forced to pick up more of the burden while simultaneously juggling their own responsibilities. She also emphasized how vital federal funding programs are for allocating resources to marginalized students. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds teacher training and professional development for special education teachers, and that's a huge chunk of federal funding that's going to be impacted. It's going to impact the numbers of special education positions, Kini said. The same is true for Title 1 funding for low-income students and Title 3 funding for multilingual students. IDEA is a law that ensures free public education to children with disabilities, including special education and other resources. The DOE promised that it would continue delivering all statutory programs, including funding for special needs and disadvantaged students, formula funding, student loans and Pell Grants for low-income students. Yet sources told ABC News that most of the reduction in force affected the Offices for Civil Rights and Federal Student Aid, effectively terminating many of the department's employees who are tasked with investigating discrimination within schools and helping the nation's students achieve higher education. Kini spoke to the job cuts at OCR, emphasizing that students will not be protected from unlawful discrimination and explaining how this would consequently force teachers to pick up an additional responsibility and play more of that watchdog role. When asked about the future of teaching, Kini expressed a bleak outlook over the likelihood of young people seeking to pursue education as a career. It would be a little bit of speculation there, but I think it would be a reasonable conclusion for a young person today to look at what's happening with the uncertainty in education, and particularly with the cuts to the U.S. Department of Education, and say, 'You know what? That doesn't seem like a stable career choice for me right now,' Kini said. Jim Ward, a retired educator and retired National Education Association employee who traveled from St. Louis, Missouri, to Washington, D.C., for Friday's #EDMatters Rally outside the department's headquarters, emphasized to ABC News how students remain the most important priority. All the dedicated educators that are here today are serving in those classrooms because they care about the needs of every single student, not just the ones that look like them — although their workforce is quite diverse, too — which you might not see in some of the more exclusive private schools, Ward said. Lori Stratton of Kansas also attended the rally, telling ABC News how meaningful it was for her to be present on Friday. I've been a teacher for 34 years. Most of my sons are in education. My husband's in education. Most of my family's in education. This is our business. You know, we are believers, she said. We have dedicated our lives to supporting students in public schools, and I feel like it's an American value. I feel like there is not a bigger democratic American value than supporting education.

electric car production line 730x402 at Massive Job Loss on Horizon for Auto Workers A few weeks ago in an editorial we touched on how the electric cars going mainstream will put many tuners out of a job. If you found that article a bit gloomy, you are going to find this one downright depressing. The redundancy is not going to be limited to tuners and aftermarket specialists. It'll be pertinent to all auto workers in all branches of the industry. Automation has nothing to do with the unemployment rates in Ohio. Well, maybe a little. We all know how robots are better and more efficient at putting together electronic stuff than bulky mechanical bits. So that could theoretically make them even faster at assembling electric cars than they are at regular cars, ergo forcing the capitalist automaker to replace more of its human workers with machines – preferably AI-enabled machines that are not only more versatile, but smarter than the human workforce. That's the thing with these new technologies we are developing. They will invariably end up being smarter, more efficient, and more productive than we could ever be, making us to them what monkeys are to us. But the threat electric cars pose to auto workers goes way deeper than that, and it has nothing to do with the capitalist automaker. You see, an EV, by nature, is a much simpler machine than an ICE car – one with a traditional internal combustion engine. Take the electric motor, for instance. It is the size of a melon, and it has basically one moving part. In the same time that it takes a current robot to assemble a gasoline engine, another specialized robot can put together five e-motors. So a job that didn't require human expertise in the first place, maybe only in a supervisory capacity, is getting further away from the man's reach and scope of capability. electric car production line 1 730x389 at Massive Job Loss on Horizon for Auto Workers So autonomous vehicles are going to put drivers out of work, and electric cars are going to make auto workers redundant. But it doesn't end there. The same characteristics that make an electric car easier to build will also change its maintenance routines. An EV has few or no oily bits. Its motor is electric, its drivetrain could all be drive-by-wire, even the suspension is computer controlled. If something goes wrong with any of these parts, having them swapped with a new part produced cheaply by some Chinese company is going to make a lot more sense than having them fixed. That is, if you can find someone who will be able to fix those complex electronic devices. What that means is, the EVs will also put a huge number of mechanics and technicians out of work. They can join their brethren from factories and transportation segments in the unemployed line. Now, you might argue that we have experienced something like this before with the rise of automation and assembly line robots, and we turned out to be okay at the end of the day. That is a good argument, but you have to take into account that back then we still had the option of employing the masses made redundant by a new technology in another field or branch of the same industry. What makes the situation seem dire now is that the smart, super intelligent, super clever technologies are wrapping their tentacles around every single field and branch. What's more, it was relatively easy to re-train an assembly-line worker so he or she could now work in, say, the interior trim department. But will be it easy, or even possible, to re-train them in the skills required for the new era, i.e. computer coding, robotics, artificial intelligence, network security, data collection, etc.? The more likely scenario is the emergence of what Professor Yuval Noah Harari calls the useless class, ex-employees and new workforce who don't have what it takes to be employed in any of the new fields, and can't be trained for it either because there is a computer that does that job better, cheaper and more.|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2018/04/massive-job-loss-on-horizon-for-auto-workers/
The Canadian government is considering canceling its contract with U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin in light of the imposed tariffs by the Trump administration, the CBC reported. In June 2023, Canada signed a $19 billion contract to purchase 88 of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. But the Canadian government is looking for alternatives to their air defense in response to the ongoing tariff war and President Donald Trump's repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Canada has already paid for 16 of the aircraft and is weary about supporting and maintaining a mixed fleet of fighter jets that would require their own unique training, hangers, infrastructure, and supply chain, all of which would increase cost. The first shipment of F-35s is scheduled to be delivered early in 2026. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

GAZA CITY, Palestine More than 150 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the ceasefire agreement took effect on Jan. 19, 2025, including 40 in the past two weeks, the Gaza Media Office announced Saturday. We have observed the occupation deliberately escalating its field crimes against civilians in recent weeks, targeting individuals collecting firewood or inspecting their homes, resulting in their deaths by Israeli army fire, the office said in a statement. The remarks came after an Israeli airstrike on Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, which killed nine Palestinians, including journalists and humanitarian aid workers. Condemning the attack as a heinous massacre , the Gaza Media Office accused Israel of escalating its aggression amid reports of increased military directives from Israeli leadership. The office rejected Israel's justification, saying the targeted individuals were all civilians working in a shelter area, conducting media documentation for a charitable organization. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) must take urgent action against Israeli war crimes, including those committed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the statement added. The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed that several injured victims were taken to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza following the attack. Eyewitnesses said the airstrike targeted a relief team distributing temporary tents to residents displaced by Israeli bombings. The Palestinian Journalists' Protection Center also confirmed that three journalists were among those killed, stating they were documenting humanitarian relief efforts for those affected by Israel's ongoing military campaign. The attack is part of a series of Israeli ceasefire violations, despite the truce brokered by Egypt, Qatar, and the US. The first phase of the ceasefire agreement, which lasted six weeks, ended in early March. However, Israel has refused to proceed with the second phase, which was expected to include further prisoner exchanges with Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stalled negotiations, seeking to extend the initial exchange period without fulfilling military and humanitarian commitments under the agreement. Hamas has reaffirmed its commitment to the ceasefire and urged mediators to enforce Israel's compliance and push forward with negotiations. Since October 2023, Israeli attacks have killed more than 48,500 Palestinians, most of them women and children, and left Gaza in ruins.|2025-03-16|https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/israel-kills-over-150-palestinians-since-ceasefire-including-40-in-past-two-weeks-gaza-media-office/3510710

A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country.James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there.Related video above: Trump threatens tariffs to enforce migrant deportations (01/27/25) I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody.The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear.Claiming the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang, Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the legal battle brewing over Trump's move. The judge was scheduled to consider expanding the prohibition on deportation just minutes after Trump's afternoon announcement. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month.Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization.Trump pledged to use the Alien Enemies Act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump's declaration even became public. The suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours.Boasberg agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was to preserve the status quo. Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States.Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch.If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal.It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court should halt that path in its tracks, the department argued.The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang.The White House is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador.Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.ksbw.com/article/trump-invokes-18th-century-law-to-declare-invasion-by-gangs-speed-deportations/64195674
SILIGURI: A real-life Jurassic Park is taking shape in the cloud-draped Eastern Himalayas - not to resurrect dinosaurs, but a last stand for species on the brink. Here, among red pandas and snow leopards, science is not cloning the past, but saving what remains of the present. Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park in Darjeeling is India's first frozen zoo - a genetic ark preserving the DNA of Himalayan wildlife in steel tanks filled with liquid nitrogen at temperatures plunging to -196°C. A collaboration between the zoo and Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, the cryogenic conservation initiative aims to ensure that even if these species dwindle in the wild, their genetic blueprints remain intact. This is an effort to preserve DNA samples, said Debal Roy, Bengal's chief wildlife warden. Frozen zoos are gaining traction across the globe Bengal's chief wildlife warden Debal Roy said, We will collect tissue samples from wild animals. If an animal dies naturally or due to unnatural causes such as road kill, we have decided to take their tissue samples and preserve them in this facility. Spread across 67.8 acres at an altitude of 2,150 metres (7,050ft), the zoo is India's highest-altitude zoological park and a leader in conservation breeding programmes for red pandas, snow leopards, and Tibetan wolves. It has also undertaken conservation work for species like the Markhor (screw-horned goat), Mishmi takin, and Himalayan black bear. Unlike traditional zoos, where animals are showcased for visitors, this facility has a dual role - housing live animals while also banking their genetic legacy. Frozen zoos are gaining traction globally, offering a last line of defence against extinction. In Darjeeling, bio-banking efforts began in July last year, with scientists collecting and preserving genetic material from captive animals such as red pandas, Himalayan black bears, snow leopards, and gorals. As of now, we have started with captive animals, zoo director Basavaraj Holeyachi said. We have developed a dedicated lab inside the zoo where we preserve gametes and DNA of endangered species. The process involves two levels of preservation: genetic sampling, which requires storage at -20°C and bio-banking, where tissues must be submerged in liquid nitrogen at -196°C. Scientists prepare the samples to prevent cell damage. The frozen zoo contains irreplaceable genetic material - living cell lines, gametes, and embryos - that are vital for conservation efforts, assisted reproduction, and evolutionary biology, Holeyachi said. In the future, stored genetic material could be used for assisted reproduction techniques, including the possibility of using surrogate mothers to revive species. As long as there is a continuous supply of liquid nitrogen, these tissues can be stored indefinitely, said an official. The facility's efforts have drawn international recognition, with World Association of Zoos and Aquariums recently shortlisting it for its red panda conservation initiatives. As habitats shrink and climate change alters ecosystems, the frozen zoo may hold the key to ensuring that the ghostly silhouettes of snow leopards and the playful rustlings of red pandas continue to be more than just echoes of the past.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-bio-banked-genetic-material-darjeeling-has-indias-first-frozen-zoo/articleshow/119059479.cms

And nowhere is that more so than in the United States, where parades take place in cities around the country and all kinds of foods and drinks are given an emerald hue. In fact, it was among Irish American communities that the day became the celebration it is, from its roots as a more solemn day with a religious observance in Ireland. But even in America, it was about more than a chance to dye a river green (looking at you, Chicago) or just bust out a favorite piece of green clothing, it was about putting down roots and claiming a piece of the country's calendar. Who is St. Patrick and why does he even have a day? Patrick was not actually Irish, according to experts. Born in the late fourth century, he was captured as an adolescent and ended up enslaved in Ireland. He escaped to another part of Europe where he was trained as a priest and returned to Ireland in the fifth century to promote the spread of Christianity. Several centuries later, he was made a saint by the Catholic Church and like other saints had a day dedicated to him, which was March 17. He became Ireland's patron saint, and even when religious strife broke out between Catholics and Protestants, was claimed by both, says Mike Cronin, historian and academic director of Boston College Dublin. How did an Irish saint's day become an American thing? The short answer: Irish people came to America and brought their culture with them. St. Patrick's Day observances date back to before the founding of the U.S., in places like Boston and New York City. The first parade was held in Manhattan in 1762. While the day was marked with more of a religious framing and solemnity in Ireland until well into the 20th century, in America it became the cultural and boisterous celebration it is today, marked by plenty of people without a trace of Irish heritage. It was because people in Ireland started seeing how the day was marked in the U.S. that it became more of a festival in the country of its origin rather than strictly a religious observance, Cronin says, pointing to the parades, parties and other festivities that are held. Oh, and by the way, for those who like to shorten names: Use St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day. Paddy is a nickname for Pádraig, which is the Irish spelling of Patrick.

Holidays aren't simply days to watch bands go by, or wear a specific outfit or costume. Being able to mark a holiday, and have others mark it, is a way of putting down roots, showing that you've made it in American culture, says Leigh Schmidt, professor in the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University. You've made your claim on that American calendar, in American civic life, by having these holidays widely recognized. The spread of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the U.S. was a way for Irish immigrant communities, who in the 19th century faced discrimination and opposition, to stake that ground, he says: It's a kind of immigrant Irish way of combating nativist antagonism against them. What's with four-leaf clovers, anyway? A popular sight around the holiday is the shamrock, or three-leaf clover, linked to Ireland and St. Patrick. The lucky ones, though, come across something that's harder to find: a four-leaf clover. That's because it takes a recessive trait or traits in the clover's genetics for there to be more than the normal 3 leaves, says Vincent Pennetti, who has been fascinated by the plants since high school. Four-leaf clovers are real. They are rare, he says. That doesn't mean they can't be found. People just have to keep their eyes open and get really good at noticing patterns and breaks in the patterns, and they just start jumping out at you, he says. Katie Glerum finds them. She says it's not unheard of for her to be somewhere like out in a park and see one. She usually scoops it up and often gives it to someone else, to a positive response. If it happened every day, then I probably would be less excited about it, she says. But yeah, when it happens, it is exciting.|2025-03-16|https://www.whas11.com/article/news/nation-world/st-patricks-day-2025-meaning-history/507-1a05aa0e-1e3b-4f87-a62b-9affdee6703e

Mr Trump said on social media: Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. Donald Trump gives a speech / Trump Justice / Mr Trump issued a new warning to Iran (AP) The move comes two weeks after the American leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons programme that Mr Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory on Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were injured. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the air strikes will not deter them and they would retaliate against the US. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The air strikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. These relentless assaults have cost the US and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Mr Trump said.|2025-03-16|https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/national/25011355.trump-orders-strikes-houthi-rebels-yemen-issues-new-warning-iran/
Special Correspondent Panaji Admitting that there is a drop in enrolment of students in schools across the country, Union Ministry of Education has said that in Goa there has been such a drop of 6,789 students over the last five years. The total enrolment of students in Goan schools during the academic year 2018-19 was 3,11,524, while it came down to 3,04,735 in the academic year 2023-24, it stated. The state has observed a decline in school enrolment, particularly impacting primary schools, potentially linked to the exodus of migrant families during the pandemic, and a declining birth rate. In Goa, the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) for students from pre-primary to second grade was 72% in 2024, with female enrolment at 118%, slightly higher than male enrolment at 112.9%. The state government aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020. In 2021, Goa's GER in higher education stood at 33.8 %. Union Minister of State for Education Jayant Chaudhary told the Rajya Sabha during the ongoing budget session of the Parliament that there are some major reasons for the fall in enrolment. The major reasons for drop-out of school children are to supplement household income, to attend domestic chores, not interested in studies, unable to cope up with studies, child suffering with some disability, poor health, education not considered necessary by parents, preparation of competitive examination, marriage etc, Chaudhary said. However, the central government assists states and Union territories through the centrally sponsored Scheme of Samagra Shiksha in order to reduce dropout, Chaudhury said, maintaining that also, based on the recommendations of National Education Policy 2020 (NEP 2020), with effect from the academic year 2022-23, the Unified District Information System + (UDISE+) has been revitalised to capture individual student-wise data and created student's registry. There has been a complete change in the manner of collection of data from 2022-23 onwards from gross enrolment data to individual student data, he said, pointing out, It makes comparison of data from previous years, statistically different/ inchoate. UDISE+ system records data on indicators of school education provided by all the states and Union territories. As per UDISE+, the number of students recorded for the year 2022-23 and 2023-24 is 25,17,91,722 and 24,80,45,828, respectively. In Goa, a concerning trend of declining school enrolment, particularly in government primary schools, has led to closures and mergers of many of these schools, with 57% of schools having less than five students and 42 having zero enrolment.|2025-03-16|https://www.navhindtimes.in/2025/03/16/goanews/enrolment-in-goa-down-by-6789-students-in-last-5-yrs/

Are you like just about every Michigander, and you have some plans to go up north this summer? Well, that trip is about to get a whole lot harder. No one likes construction, but it's a necessary evil to make sure that everything is safe enough for us to drive on. And that's especially important when it comes to a bridge that's over water, which is exactly what's about to see construction. Major Bridge Construction Will Affect Michigan Summer Travel Plans If you live south of Saginaw County in some fashion and you take I-75 to go up north, get ready for construction this summer. The Lansing State Journal reports that the Zilwaukee Bridge is going to have lane closures beginning this spring and running through the fall. Google Maps The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) is kicking off a $2.9 million construction project on April 15th. During this first phase of the project, the southbound lanes of I-75 on the Zilwaukee Bridge will be shut down. When is Construction on I-75 Happening? This first phase is anticipated to run from April 15th to June 27th. The second phase is expected to run from July 14th to sometime in November. 1240 WJIM AM logo / Google Maps Get our free mobile app There will be detours in place; Southbound traffic will be detoured to southbound Interstate 675 from the junction north of Kochville Road to the southbound I-75/I-675 interchange south of Wadsworth Road The southbound I-75 ramp to Adams Street will be closed, as well as the Adams Street ramp to southbound I-75. Traffic will be detoured via southbound I-675 and Tittabawassee Road (Exit 6) to Adams Street, and vice versa The northbound I-675 ramp to southbound I-75 also will be closed. Traffic will be detoured via northbound I-75, M-84 (Exit 160), southbound I-75 and southbound I-675 to southbound I-75. We don't know the detour info for the second phase just yet, as that will be announced before the start of that work. 15 Reasons Why Spring Is Genuinely Michigan's Worst Season What's great about Michigan is that it actually gets to experience all four seasons in the year. But just because we have all four seasons doesn't mean that we have to like them all. Case and point; Spring is the absolute worst season in Michigan. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely some redeeming factors like the fact that plant life starts to bloom again and that we finally start to see warmer weather after a frigid winter. But that doesn't change the fact that spring is the worst season in Michigan, and we have the receipts to prove it. Take a look at the list below for 15 reasons why spring is just the worst.

Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.wclk.com/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation
South Carolina will shoot for its fifth straight victory Tuesday night when it hosts No. 25 Clemson in the annual Palmetto Series rivalry game in Columbia, S.C.The Tigers have won five of the last seven meetings, but haven't won at the Gamecocks' Colonial Life Arena since 2018.Clemson (9-2) dropped nine spots in the AP Top 25 poll Monday after losing to Memphis 87-82 in overtime, and Tigers coach Brad Brownell sees Tuesday's game as another big challenge. It's a tough turnaround, Brownell said Saturday after the Memphis game. It's a big game for a lot of reasons, obviously, it's a rivalry game. We will find out what we're made of. Now you have to rally the troops. With these emotional highs and lows you really don't have that much time to adjust. That will be a real challenge for us. We have to compete and execute to win. As usual, Clemson's strength is its defense. They allow 64.6 points per game, which is 36th in the nation. Only two opponents have broken the 70-point mark against the Tigers.Offensively, Clemson rolls with a senior-heavy team that reached the Elite Eight last season. Chase Hunter is averaging a career-high 16 points this season and also setting personal bests in 3-point shooting (37.7 percent), rebounds (3.0 per game) and steals (1.4 per game).Tigers 6-foot-8 senior forward Ian Schieffelin is third in the nation in rebounds at 12 per game, while also averaging 13 points.The matchup between Schieffelin and South Carolina star sophomore Collin Murray-Boyles will be one to watch. Murray-Boyles was an All-SEC freshman team pick last season and is shooting 63.9 percent from the field and leading South Carolina with 15.7 points per game.Jamarii Thomas adds 12.5 ppg and Jacobi Wright averages 10.6 for coach Lamont Paris' South Carolina squad.Paris has his team on high alert against the Tigers.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/no-25-clemson-south-carolina-reignite-rivalry-series/

Erie County man faces weapons, firearm charges after pet pig's death An altercation with law enforcement following a pet pig's shooting death led to charges for an Erie County man on Friday night. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video CONCORD, N.Y. — An altercation with law enforcement following a pet pig's shooting death led to charges for an Erie County man. It all began with a 10 p.m. Friday phone call from a veterinary hospital to the Erie County Sheriff's Office. The call concerned 50-year-old Marc Reszka of Concord, who called the hospital in an upset state after he had euthanized a pet pig by shooting it with a firearm, according to a sheriff's office statement. A welfare check followed at Reszka's address on Springville-Boston Road. Officers said Reszka appeared disheveled and upset, and they observed a significant number of dried drops and smears of blood on the floor. Officers later found a dead pig in a garbage bag in the entryway. They also saw 11 firearms in plain view. Reszka has an active order of protection, which stipulates that he was to surrender all firearms, the sheriff's office said. When they attempted to place Reszka in handcuffs, the sheriff's office claims Reszka pushed officers away and began to run toward the woods. They said he ignored multiple warnings that he could be tased if he did not stop running. Officers tased Reszka, who fell to the ground. He was taken to Bertrand Chaffee Hospital for evaluation. After his release, Reszka was taken to the Erie County Holding Center, where he was being held. The charges faced by Reszka include two counts of criminal use of a firearm, one count of criminal possession of a weapon, 11 counts of criminal possession of a firearm, 11 counts of criminal contempt, resisting arrest, and obstructing governmental administration. A search of the New York State electric court filing system on Saturday did not show any court dates for Reszka.|2025-03-16|https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/crime/man-charged-pet-pig-euthanized/71-8a028392-5f64-457f-8929-59d824b0b8c3
Cagayan de Oro City – For three straight nights, nightly prayer rallies have been spreading across Mindanao like wildfire, with people coming out of their homes to pray and chant Ibalik Tatay Digong, a regional Partido Demokratiko Lakas ng Bayan (PDLBN) president reported early Sunday morning. Manny Lumanao said in a telephone interview with DAILYTRIBUNE from Butuan City that the vigils were held in towns across Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Maguindanao, Davao City, and even in the island province of Dinagat. People are coming out of their homes, including senior citizens holding candles, he said. Earlier, Benito Ranque, co-convenor of the Bring Duterte Home Movement, announced that daily prayer rallies would be held nationwide, seeking divine intervention for the return of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte. These rallies aim to demand Duterte's return after his arrest and detention at the International Court Detention Center in the Netherlands. The kickoff rally was held at Liwasang Bonifacio on Saturday night, with similar events planned across the country while Tatay Digong remains in prison. Lumanao said nightly prayer rallies had spontaneously formed in Butuan, Tandag, Surigao City, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao City. At dusk, people begin gathering in public places for spontaneous peace rallies, he said. Duterte refused to stay in Hong Kong According to Ranque, Duterte was informed in advance of the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant and was advised to stay in Hong Kong under China's protection. However, he decided to return to the Philippines to face the charges and expose those behind the special operation that led to his arrest and transfer to the ICC. Ranque claimed police were already waiting for Duterte at Davao International Airport and Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA), but he refused to change his plans. I know what I am doing. Let them arrest me, Duterte reportedly told one of his advisers. Ranque also alleged that Duterte was aware that the Office of the President had chartered a private jet to fly him to the Netherlands for his trial on alleged crimes against humanity before the international tribunal. Remulla admits role in Duterte's arrest Ranque further claimed that Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla admitted in a television interview that he was part of the special operation to arrest Duterte and transfer him directly to the ICC. The plane was chartered by the Office of the President. We brought him straight to the Netherlands at 11:03 p.m. (Tuesday) and surrendered him to the ICC, Ranque quoted Remulla as saying. Remulla also named President Marcos, Speaker Martin Romualdez, National Security Council Secretary Eduardo Año, and Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro as the core group behind the special operation. ICC arrest warrant allegedly leaked Ranque speculated that one of the planners leaked the arrest warrant to Duterte, allowing him to anticipate the move. But Tatay Digong had already made up his mind, and the rest is history, Ranque said. He also revealed that the ICC arrest warrant had been issued a month earlier but was kept sealed until ICC investigators William Rosato, Glen Khala, and interpreter Maya Bracken visited the country last November to interview witnesses in a five-star hotel along Roxas Boulevard. However, he claimed that the investigators left sooner than expected due to widespread rallies at Liwasang Bonifacio protesting their presence. Pitifully, not too many people understand how serious this is. The only reason they dared to arrest and investigate Tatay Digong this time is because they have the full backing of President Marcos, Ranque added.|2025-03-16|https://tribune.net.ph/2025/03/15/prayer-rallies-spreading-like-wildfire-in-mindanao
by James Coulter They only lost two games this season, but even with a record of 8-2, the Lake Wales Jr. Highlanders are on the road to the Super Bowl. thumbnail_XOPD5911 - DailyRidge.com They only lost two games in the season, but we take those losses as a learning opportunity, said Eric Stoudemire, Athletic Director for the Jr. Highlanders. By overcoming adversity, you learn from your mistakes and get better. So, the kids lift their heads and keep moving forward. It got us where we are at. thumbnail_SAZV7450 - DailyRidge.com The Jr. Highlanders are competing in a league with more than 50 teams. For them to be able to compete with athletes on a high level is nothing short of a miraculous accomplishment, Stoudemire boasted. Stoudemire and his colleagues started the Lake Wales Athletic and Education Association to help middle-grade student-athletes prepare for competing on the high school level. With the Lake Wales Highlanders winning state last year for the first time, they wanted to prepare young kids with the proper material necessary to achieve that same goal. thumbnail_KJTA4318 - DailyRidge.com We know that every kid won't be attending Lake Wales High School, but we want to prepare them for any high school they attend for the next level, Stoudemire said. The game of football is so competitive, but we have a great thing going. The league that we play in is very competitive as well. The kids get a lot of exposure. Every game that we play, the kids gain experience where they can [play against] future five-star players. thumbnail_XNZC1360 - DailyRidge.com As with any good student-athlete program, the organization focuses on the student part of the student-athlete first, ensuring that their players are making the grade as well as making the play. However, regardless of how well they do in the classroom, the players nevertheless benefit from being on the field if it means keeping them off the streets and out of trouble, Stoudemire said. We know that in those two hours a day out of the week, we have those kids in our possession, and we know those kids are not out in the street, they are not sitting around with negative thoughts on their mind and all that, he said. So, with that program, it keeps the kids busy and it keeps them under adult supervision so that we know where they are. If they are not at school, they are on the field practicing with us. thumbnail_FPKO6909 - DailyRidge.com Stoudemire owes their success thus far to the hard work and effort provided by the coaches and the parents. However, he feels their organization could receive more support from the city and the community. Moreover, he hopes that the experience and lessons they are providing to their student-athletes will help them to grow into upstanding young men and women who will become productive members of their community. thumbnail_GRID5535 - DailyRidge.com We all pray that our kids become successful and they give back like we give back, he said. We want these kids to open doors for the elderly, we want them to have manners, so we are teaching kids to be successful and meet their goals. It is not just football. We have young men and women, young boys and girls, who will become young men and women, so we want to put them on the path to become what they need to be.

Fresh off a statement win over Ohio State, No. 2 Auburn aims to extend its dominant run against visiting Georgia State on Tuesday.The Tigers (9-1), who received 12 first-place votes in Monday's AP Top 25 poll, followed a 98-54 win over Richmond with Saturday's 91-53 victory against the Buckeyes in Atlanta.AP Preseason All-American Johni Broome became the first Auburn player to record 20 points and 20 rebounds in a game since Kelvin Ardister in 1989. Broome tallied 21 points and 20 boards, increasing his team-best 19.7 points and nation-leading 12.7 rebounds per game. (Johni) is so incredibly talented, Auburn head coach Bruce Pearl said. A 20-20 game where he missed nine shots, and every one of them looked like they were going to go in. Following the Tigers' six-point loss at then-No. 9 Duke on Dec. 4, Auburn's two-game winning streak has provided historic offensive numbers. Looking to extend the trend Tuesday, Pearl's group won't take any opponent lightly. That was the largest margin of victory Auburn's ever had over a power five school, Pearl added Saturday. It's because we took a really well-coached Ohio State team and respected them. But now we've got Georgia State on Tuesday, so it's a short turnaround and then Purdue on Saturday in Birmingham. So we've still got two tests before Christmas break. Following Broome's lead, Chad Baker-Mazara chips in 12.6 points per game, while Tahaad Pettiford has added 11.1 points per contest in 10 games off the bench.Walking into the buzzsaw that is Auburn basketball, Georgia State (4-6) enters on a three-game losing streak. Tuesday marks the Panthers' third game against a Southeastern Conference opponent, they've already suffered a 35-point loss at Mississippi State and a 29-point drubbing at then-No. 8 Kentucky.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/no-2-auburn-going-for-third-straight-win-vs-georgia-state/

(AP PHOTO) They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote. Tehran should not threaten the American people, its president or global shipping routes, Trump said. If Iran does, it should BEWARE because America will hold you fully accountable, and we won't be nice about it! he added. The Houthi militia said late on Saturday that US-British strikes had hit areas north Sana'a. The Houthi-affiliated television station al-Masirah said that an American-British aggression targeted a residential neighbourhood in the Shu'ub district, north of the capital, Sana'a, with raids . Thirteen civilians were killed and nine others were injured in the airstrikes, a spokesman from Yemen's Ministry of Health and Environment told Lebanese broadcaster Al Mayadeen. The SABA news agency cited the Yemeni ministry as condemning the targeting of civilians and civilian objects, which it said constitutes a full-fledged war crime and a flagrant violation of all international laws and conventions. We affirm the right of Yemen and its armed forces to respond appropriately to the arrogance, intransigence, terrorism, and American-British aggression, the Yemeni parliament said, according to al-Masirah. The Houthi militia meanwhile in response to the strikes said that the aggression will not go unanswered, and our armed forces are fully prepared to respond to escalation with escalation . Residents in Sanaa said the strikes hit a building in a stronghold of the militant Houthi group. The explosions were violent and shook the neighbourhood like an earthquake. They terrified our women and children, one of the residents, who gave his name as Abdullah Yahia, told Reuters. The Houthis launched more than 100 attacks targeting shipping from November 2023, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. The attack marks the first strike to hit Yemen since the Gaza ceasefire deal took effect in January. (EPA PHOTO) The attack marks the first strike to hit Yemen since the Gaza ceasefire deal took effect in January. (EPA PHOTO) During that period, the group sank two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers in an offensive that disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa. The previous US administration of President Joe Biden had sought to degrade the Houthis ability to attack vessels off its coast but limited the US actions. US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say Trump has authorised a more aggressive approach, which appeared to match his rhetoric. The Houthi attack on American vessels will not be tolerated. We will use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective, Trump wrote. The attack marks the first strikes to hit Yemen since the Gaza ceasefire deal took effect in January. It also came a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red and Arabian seas, the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Gulf of Aden, ending a period of relative calm starting in January with the Gaza ceasefire.|2025-03-16|https://www.merimbulanewsweekly.com.au/story/8917702/trump-launches-strikes-against-yemens-houthis/?cs=14264

Gosho Aoyama's Detective Conan is one of the longest running manga series still coming out with new chapters every week, and now it's easier than ever for fans to check out the entire story so far. Detective Conan first hit the pages of Shogakukan's Weekly Shonen Sunday magazine back in 1994, and has released over 1100 chapters in the decades since. It's one of the most popular manga franchises in Japan, but has not had the same amount of success in North America due to the manga's availability. But now all of that has changed significantly thanks to a major update from Viz Media. Videos by ComicBook.com Viz Media, who licensed Detective Conan under the English title of Case Closed, has announced that ahead of Yaiba: Samurai Legend's premiere later this Spring, they are now offering all 1140 current chapters of the manga release with the Viz Manga service. While the service had been offering the latest simulpub chapter releases for the past few months, the entire backlog has been officially updated. So now is the perfect time to check out this classic series. Is It Detective Conan or Case Closed? One of the big debates that has sparked over the years is whether to refer to the series as either Detective Conan or Case Closed. The original release in Japan is labeled as Detective Conan, and that's ideally the name you should refer it to. But with Viz Media licensing it under Case Closed, and continuing its releases through that name, there's nothing wrong with using that title either. In fact, it's likely the one fans in North America are more used to thanks to the anime adaptation that had a brief run with Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block all those years ago. It would be easier to jump into the series and keep referring to it by the name you're used to. And either would be valid. There's a hope that it will soon kick off to a whole new realm of popularity as the manga is now more widely available in North America. That had been one of the issues before where if you missed out on some of the earliest volumes hitting shelves years ago, it became pretty much impossible to go back and find them. But now that they are all available digitally in this new way, fans can catch up with the over 1,100 chapters with ease and see why it's been such a hit in Japan. RELATED: Yaiba Reboot Anime Hypes Spring Release With New Trailer & Poster March 14, 2025 / — VIZ Media (@VIZMedia) / pic.twitter.com/LoYo1wIOMc / https://t.co/SebhTyirS7 / Viz Media / Shogakukan What's Next for Detective Conan? Detective Conan is such a massive hit for Japan that it's been taking over the box office with each of its movie releases. It's already gearing up to do the same with its 28th feature film, Detective Conan: One-Eyed Flashback, which is currently scheduled to hit theaters across Japan on April 18th. It's going to be breaking a record for the franchise to as it hits over 550 theaters, which is a first for the franchise's history. That further showcases how much fans are anticipating the new film. Once again, that's not as big of a factor in North America. The film has yet to announce any international release plans as of the time of this publication, and that could change in the future if there's enough demand from fans. That unfortunately might not be the case yet, but with all of the chapters now available to read with Viz Manga there's a chance that Detective Conan is going to be even bigger as more fans catch up in an easier way than ever before.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/anime/news/detective-conan-manga-read-online/
President Donald Trump announced that he's ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen in a post shared on his Truth Social account Saturday (March 15). Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote. The president then directly threatened the Houthi rebels, writing, YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he added, while also warning Iran to cease its support of the group immediately. Trump also took aim at former President Joe Biden's past handling of the Houthi rebels following their attack on American warships in the Red Sea. Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden, he wrote. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies.

A couple of key developments worth discussing are winter storm warnings, mountain pass travel, and when to expect dry weather to return, so let's dive right in. Winter Storm Warning Alert A winter storm warning is affecting the mountain passes, which is in effect until 11 a.m. tomorrow for elevations above 2000 feet. During this period, travel could become difficult, if not impossible, at times. Conditions are expected to worsen throughout the day, with Saturday night being particularly challenging. We're anticipating rounds of moderate to heavy snow, so if you have the option to delay your travel plans until tomorrow afternoon, our meteorologist, Abby Acone, highly recommends doing so. Even if you're a seasoned driver, remember that others on the road might not be as experienced. Not everyone adheres to washout restrictions, so it's something to keep in mind as you plan your journey. Mountain Passes and Washout Restrictions Navigating the mountain passes can be tricky, so make sure to check those washout restrictions. Meanwhile, Lapush is currently enjoying a few hints of sunshine. While you might catch some sunshine today, be prepared for blustery weather. Thunderstorms, small hail, graupel, and pockets of heavy rain are sweeping through southwest Washington. Areas like Hoquiam, Montesano, Skagit, and Whatcom counties are in for a big drink of water. Snohomish County is experiencing windy conditions, with gusts forecasted to reach around 40 mph. However, it's unlikely to be widespread or long-lasting enough to warrant a wind advisory. Futurecast: What to Expect Looking ahead, our second area of low pressure will bring more extensive lowland rain and mountain snow this evening. Hour by hour, expect damp weather at noon, showers continuing into the afternoon, and evening rain by ten. It's not going to be a constant downpour, and you might see hints of sunshine here and there. Be prepared for alternating downpours. Temperatures will vary, with some areas like Bellevue and Issaquah reaching the low 50s, while others like Lakewood, Gig Harbor, and Belfair North will feel cooler in the upper 40s. Out west, Long Beach might hit 50, but Aberdeen will likely fall short. Seven-Day Forecast: A Glimpse Ahead Tomorrow promises fewer showers, which will be a welcome change. Saint Patrick's Day will feature spotty showers and glimpses of sunshine. Tuesday looks mainly dry, with dry conditions during the daytime on Wednesday before rain returns in the evening. Scattered showers will accompany the arrival of spring on Thursday, marking the spring equinox. Let's embrace the change! Friday brings an atmospheric river, with lowland rain, mountain snow, and some wind. Overnight temperatures will dip into the mid-30s, so keep that in mind. As always, the weather can be unpredictable, and this forecast is subject to change. Stick with us for the latest updates as we break down the evolving conditions. Stay safe and weather-aware!

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://newstalk1130.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
(Bloomberg) -- President Emmanuel Macron's approval rating jumped 5 points as worries among French citizens over international crises soared, according to a poll by Ipsos-Cesi école d'ingénieurs for La Tribune Dimanche newspaper. Most Read from Bloomberg Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Support for Macron's actions rose to 27% in March, the survey published late Saturday showed. Concerns over international crises such as in Ukraine and the Middle East was among the top three issues for 33% of respondents, up from 17% in February. US President Donald Trump has pared back support for Ukraine and has indicated that the US may step back from its traditional security role in Europe. The surprise move has sent European countries scrambling to boost defense spending and rethink their military positioning. Support for French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou fell 2 points to 25%, according to Ipsos. Ipsos surveyed 1,000 adults online on from March 12 through March 14.

This fall's iPhone range already looks like it will break the mold by adding an iPhone 17 Air. But could 2025 be the year of the iPhone 17 Ultra as well? A new report suggests that it's on the cards. Well, 2025 has seen a big name change in just the last few weeks when what was predicted to be the iPhone SE actually turned out to be something quite different: the iPhone 16e. So, as MacRumors points out, another name change could be in prospect. You may remember reading reports that Apple flirted with the idea of introducing a super high-end Ultra model that would either replace its Pro Max device or sit above it in Apple's smartphone hirearchy. These reports appeared in the pre-launch iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 rumor cycles, but ultimately came to nothing. Now though, the rumor is back, the report says, citing the Korean news aggregator account yeux1122 on the Naver blog. To be clear, if we see the iPhone 17 Ultra, I absolutely don't believe it will be another phone that sits above the iPhone 17 Pro Max—that would mean five new iPhones and it's just too many, I'd say. Instead, it would be a renaming of the iPhone 17 Pro Max as part of a recognition that it wasn't just a bigger version of the iPhone 17 Pro. This fits with the iPhone 16e naming policy: there were so many design and component differences introduced in the 16e that naming it SE fourth-generation seemed impossible, in retrospect. The blog report points out that the largest iPhone this fall is already predicted to have a smaller Dynamic Island than the Pro, as well as a vapor chamber cooling system and a larger battery. The battery is not the germane difference here: reports say a bigger battery will mean an iPhone thicker than ever, which is a key design change. So, what would this mean? Theoretically, September would bring four new iPhones as usual but they would be called iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Air (or some other sobriquet suggesting thinness), iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Ultra. I like it, though I'd note that it can only happen if it's the beginning of a trend: if there's an Ultra, it needs to offer distinct upgrades from the Pro, more than just a different camera, battery size or price tag. More as we have it.ForbesiPhone 16e: Apple's New iPhone Has A Bluetooth Problem—A Fix Is Coming|2025-03-16|https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidphelan/2025/03/15/apple-iphone-17-ultra-report-says-all-new-iphone-coming-this-fall/

HAVE ANY OF THAT SEVERE WEATHER HEADED OUR DIRECTION ANYTIME SOON. YEAH, WE LOOK PRETTY QUIET FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. AND AN INTERESTING NOTE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE DUST STORMS THAT WERE IN TEXAS AND THEN SOME OF THE WILDFIRES IN OKLAHOMA. THAT'S SOME OF THE REASON WHY YOUR CAR WAS DIRTY AS YOU WOKE UP THIS MORNING. SOME OF THE RAIN PICKING UP SOME OF THAT DUST THAT CAME FROM TEXAS AND MAYBE EVEN SOME OF THE SMOKE FROM OKLAHOMA, AND THAT WAS ALL DUMPED OUT IN SOME OF OUR STORMS YESTERDAY. SO IF YOU WALKED OUTSIDE THIS MORNING, YOU'RE LIKE, MAN, I NEED A CAR WASH. THAT WAS PROBABLY THE REASON WHY. NOW, TOMORROW IT'S GOING TO BE MUCH CALMER. THE BREEZE WILL CALM DOWN. OUR TEMPERATURES WILL BE A TAD MORE MILD. GETTING INTO THE 50S MONDAY AND TUESDAY. SO MONDAY INCLUDES SAINT PATRICK'S DAY. WE'RE GOING TO BE MUCH WARMER OUTSIDE. A BIT OF A BREEZE ON MONDAY, SO WE MIGHT HAVE TO WATCH FOR MORE FIRE DANGER, BUT TEMPERATURES MAY GET CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES ON MONDAY. IT'S GOING TO BE A NICE WARM UP TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS OUR NEXT SYSTEM COMING THROUGH. THAT COULD BRING SOME CHANGE. ITS IMPACT WEATHER RIGHT NOW FOR THE CHANCE OF RAIN CHANGING OVER TO SNOW. IT WILL ALSO BE PRETTY WINDY, SO THERE'S THAT CHANCE THERE. WE COULD GET MEASURABLE SNOWFALL. LET'S WALK THROUGH IT HERE ON STORM PREDICTOR. I WANT TO GET THIS TO YOU FIRST. IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A MASSIVE SNOW STORM, BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE RAIN WINDS THERE TUESDAY NIGHT. AND THEN THAT WILL TRANSITION INTO SNOW SOMETIME EARLY WEDNESDAY. AND WE COULD GET A COUPLE OF INCHES OUT OF THIS. SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE A WHOLE LOT THAT. BUT THE SNOW COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE WIND COULD DEFINITELY BRING IMPACTS TO YOUR WEDNESDAY MORNING. SO JUST KNOW THAT NOW WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF DETAILS TO WORK OUT AND THINGS COULD CHANGE, BUT JUST WANT THAT ON YOUR RADAR HERE EARLY. THE SUN WILL EVENTUALLY SET IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF IN THE WESTERN SKY. WE COULD GET A PRETTY GOOD SUNSET OUT OF THIS. AS LONG AS WE KEEP THOSE CLOUDS RIGHT ALONG THE HORIZON. OUT OF HERE, 41 DEGREES. THE WINDS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST STILL BREEZY, 23MPH, 41 FOR OMAHA AND PLATTSMOUTH, 41 FOR TEKAMAH AS WELL. MIDDLE 40S FOR FAR SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA, BUT 30S FOR WESTERN IOWA. WIND SPEEDS ARE STILL GUSTING PRETTY STRONG. OR THESE ARE THE CONSTANT WINDS. THE STRAIGHT LINE WINDS HERE UP NEAR 25MPH. HERE ARE THE GUSTS UP NEAR 35MPH. SO THAT'S STILL DRAGGING IN A LITTLE BIT OF COOLER AIR. THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN COOLER THIS MORNING. AND NOW WE HAVE CLOUDS CLEARING OUT AS HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY DESCENDS INTO OUR VICINITY. SO WE'LL KEEP PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND THEN CLEARING OUT OVERNIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE, STAYING AROUND INTO THE MORNING HOURS. TOMORROW WE WATCH THIS WARM FRONT COME CLOSER TO US ON SUNDAY, BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE PASS THROUGH. BUT ONCE IT DOES, WHEN WE GET CLOSER TO MONDAY, THAT WILL BRING A BREEZY SOUTHWEST WIND. COULD GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF FIRE DANGER, BUT IT WILL WARM US UP QUITE A BIT AS WE GET NEAR 80 DEGREES. FOR YOUR MONDAY. HERE'S HOW WE LINE UP FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING, WITH TEMPERATURES DESCENDING INTO THE 30S WITH THE BREEZE STICKING AROUND, THOUGH, YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO WANT MAYBE A THICKER JACKET BECAUSE THE FEEL LIKE TEMPERATURE COULD GET INTO THE 20S LATER ON TONIGHT. SO IF YOU HAVE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT PLANS, MAYBE THE PUFFER OR JUST A FEW LAYERS AS YOU HEAD OUT AND WE'LL SEE TEMPERATURES DROP A BIT MORE AS WE GET INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. 25 DEGREES. THE LOW TEMPERATURE THERE AND A HIGH TOMORROW, A LITTLE BIT WARMER THAN WE WERE TODAY BY MAYBE TEN DEGREES. WE GET UP INTO THE LOWER 50S OUTSIDE AND SOME OF EASTERN NEBRASKA, EVEN THE MIDDLE 50S, GETTING CLOSE TO A 60 DEGREE DAY. WE WILL GET MUCH WARMER THAN THAT ON MONDAY. THIS IS WHERE WE REALLY SEE TEMPERATURES BOOST ON YOUR SAINT PATRICK'S DAY. AS WE GET CLOSE TO 80 DEGREES. AND THEN THE CHANGE COMES LATE ON TUESDAY WHEN THAT SYSTEM COMES IN, THAT COULD BRING A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN AND THEN A LITTLE BIT OF SNOW ON TOP OF IT, POSSIBLY A LITTLE BIT OF MEASURABLE SNOW, AS IN MAYBE A FEW INCHES OUT OF THIS, SOMETHING YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SHOVEL. SO WE'LL WATCH FOR THAT ON WEDNESDAY. AND THEN THURSDAY IS THE START OF SPRING, WHERE IT FEELS PRETTY SEASONABLE ON THAT DAY. SO WE THE MAIN THING WE'RE WATCHING FOR IS THAT SNOW NEXT WEEK. BUT I MEAN, SAINT PATRICK'S DAY LOOKS SO LOVELY. YES. LOOKS AWESOME. GIVING US THAT TASTE OF SPRING.

Vice President JD Vance acknowledged mistakes made by Department Of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk during his recently orchestrated mass firings of federal employees, claiming that there were a lot of good people who work in the government during an interview with NBC News. Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I'm accepting of mistakes, Vance said. I also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I'm also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government — a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn't work. Musk, the world's richest man, is leading President Donald Trump's initiative to slash federal spending and combat what he calls federal bureaucracy, which has included the termination of thousands of government employees since the inauguration in January. The billionaire has characterized many federal workers affected by the firings as fraudsters who couldn't be trusted to do their jobs. I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job, Vance said when asked about Musk's comments during the NBC News interview. Now, how many people is that? I don't know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it's a few thousand or much larger than that. However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people's business, he added. That doesn't distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don't want the person who doesn't show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.|2025-03-16|https://wgy.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-jd-vance-acknowledges-mistakes-made-by-elon-musk/
The Gazette offers audio versions of articles using Instaread. Some words may be mispronounced. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — The Trump administration on Friday moved to dismiss lawsuits against Iowa and Oklahoma brought by the Biden administration's Department of Justice, which challenged the states' immigration laws making it a crime for someone to be in the state if they are in the U.S. illegally. Republican governors and lawmakers across the country had accused then-President Joe Biden of failing to enforce federal immigration law and manage the southern border. In response, Iowa and Oklahoma enacted similar laws that let state and local officials arrest and charge people who have outstanding deportation orders or who previously were removed from or denied admission to the U.S. Both laws followed one enacted in Texas. The Biden administration sued Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma over the respective laws. Texas' more expansive law was in effect for only a few confusing hours last March before a federal appeals court put it on hold. The Iowa and Oklahoma laws have themselves been on hold while courts consider whether they unconstitutionally usurp federal immigration authority. The Biden administration's absurd opposition to (Oklahoma's law) was particularly frustrating since it was the White House's gross negligence on border security that had made the state law so necessary in the first place, Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond said in a statement on Friday. Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird issued a statement Friday calling the dismissal a major victory for Iowans across the state. When the Biden Administration failed to do its job and secure our borders, Iowa stepped up. And we never backed down — even when Biden sued us for it. Today, President Trump, again, proved that he ha s Iowa's back and showcased his commitment to Making America Safe Again by dropping Biden's ridiculous lawsuit, Bird said in the statement. Trump ran for office on a pledge to crack down on illegal immigration and deport many who are living in the U.S. illegally, promises he acted on with executive orders during his first week in office that conflicted with the prior administration's legal position in the two cases. An immigrant rights group also sued Iowa last May over its law, but the 8th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals recently issued a decision that complicates the legal battle now that the Trump administration has withdrawn the federal government's complaint. The appellate court said the lawsuit filed by Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice should be dismissed by the district court judge, arguing the U.S. v. Iowa lawsuit made it moot. Rita Bettis Austin, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Iowa, said in a statement Friday they intended to continue fighting to keep Iowa's law from taking effect. With today's DOJ filing, we remain steadfast in our commitment to working to keep this harmful law from being enforced in Iowa, Austin said. Lawyers representing Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice in February filed a petition for rehearing with the appellate court.|2025-03-16|https://www.thegazette.com/federal-government/trump-administration-moves-to-dismiss-lawsuits-against-iowa-and-oklahoma-over-immigration-laws/
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Saturday that General Keith Kellogg's role has been narrowed from special envoy for Ukraine and Russia to only Ukraine, after Russian officials had sought to exclude him from talks aiming to end the war. General Kellogg, a Highly Respected Military Expert, will deal directly with President (Volodymyr Zelenskiy), and Ukrainian leadership, Trump said in a post on Truth Social. He knows them well, and they have a very good working relationship together. Russian officials had communicated to their counterparts in the United States that they did not want Kellogg involved in top-level discussions aimed at ending the Ukraine war, sources told Reuters this week. Some high-ranking former Russian officials have complained that Kellogg was, in their view, too sympathetic to Kyiv. Kellogg, 80, has been personally absent from some high-level discussions in recent weeks, including a meeting involving U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio with a Ukrainian delegation in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. The U.S. and Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire in principle during their meeting in Saudi Arabia. But Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested on Thursday that the ceasefire bid needs serious reworking. Kellogg was also absent at a high-level meeting with Russians in Saudi Arabia in February.

The NFL offseason has been interesting around the league. Plenty of players have switched teams as teams have started building their teams for the 2025 season. While the Falcons haven't been active in the free-agent market, they still have the 2025 NFL Draft to add upgrades to the team. The Falcons own five total picks in next month's draft, including the 15th overall pick. There are multiple different ways they can go with that selection, but it appears new defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich has his eye on someone. The Georgia Bulldogs had their pro day on March 12, and the Falcons were in attendance. Safety Malaki Starks was one of the guys who participated, and Ulbrich was in awe. During his drills, Ulbrich said, Goodness gracious. That's different. That might be the safest pick in the draft. Falcons News: Jeff Ulbrich is a Fan of Malaki Starks The Falcons do have a void at safety with Justin Simmons sitting in free agency. They still have Jessie Bates in the safety room but Ulbrich could want to get Starks added to the group. Starks is considered the top safety in this draft class. He has an elite football IQ with the ability to be a rangy defender over the top. The Georgia native will also fly downhill to make stops in the run game and has developed into a sound tackler. In 43 games with the Bulldogs, Starks has recorded 127 total tackles, 17 pass deflections, and six interceptions. Over the last two seasons, he's logged at least a 78 overall grade per PFF. One of the best parts about Starks' game is his versatility. In all three collegiate seasons, he's logged at least 150 snaps in the slot, the box, and as a deep safety. Adding that type of difference maker to the defense is intriguing to Ulbrich. Whether that same feeling is felt throughout the organization remains to be seen. If they do select Starks, it would be a homecoming for him. He was born and raised in Jefferson, Georgia. He went to Jefferson High School before committing to UGA. Starks loves Georgia and would likely be ecstatic to play for the Falcons.

Don Newbury is a speaker in the Metroplex. Email: / [email protected] / . Phone: 817-447-3872. Twitter: @donnewbury Website: www.speakerdoc.com Taxation without representation is tyranny. Though it's hard to nail down who initially coined this statement, it was the hue and cry of British Americans when they fought during the American Revolution 260 years ago. My Uncle Mort — a homespun philosopher lazily whittling away the day from a cane-bottom chair on the porch of the thicket's general store — came up with a rejoinder. It's one that millions of Americans currently believe but don't know how to express. Or to whom? And when? And how? I wish whoever first said that taxation without representation is tyranny could return and see what it's like with representation, according to my uncle. … Conservative to the bone, Mort claims no allegiance to either Democrats or Republicans, claiming to be fiercely independent. He's not yelling as loudly or stomping his feet as often — and his teeth no longer function as fangs as in yesteryear — in his battles for the common good. He's greatly saddened by the decline of our culture, values and government. Our leaders have strayed far away from reasoning, Mort opines, That's what Isaiah 1:18 makes clear in the Bible: 'Come, let us reason together'. He added that many political leaders may have never heard of this scripture, or perhaps even the Holy Bible. It's difficult to argue with his contention that ugliness and discord seem yoked both in Washington, DC, and Austin, TX. Too few people are involved in 'shot-calling' in both DC and Austin, Mort observed. There's never been a better time to consider term limits in both places. … Mort has always reserved the right to be wrong, but today's full-blown controversies are leaving many persons in cross-eyed confusion about right and wrong. For example, he's flustered about the maligned Texas system of public education and the buzz about the steamrolling proposal to provide state funds for Texans who opt for private schools. I'm not against private schools by any stretch, nor do I oppose eventual state support, but I'm not sure the voucher system is the right choice at this time, Mort explains. He's right. Texas' support for public education has been playing 'catch-up' for decades. The Lone Star State ranks 44th in the per student funding ratio among the 50 states and DC. … Before stepping down from his apple box, Mort mumbled something about Texas' long-touted rainy day fund, where some $24 billion await distribution, ostensibly for crisis situations. Mort poses a worthy question of what constitutes rainy days? He feels the political weather maps suggest that we're nearing flood levels that equal — if not exceed — those encountered by Noah. … But, wait. He climbed back atop the fruit crate. We hear that help is on the way for education, he said. That's how the state lottery got a foothold. Promises abounded that public education would be awash in funds generated by the lottery. He contends that for big winners in the lottery, there's mostly been heartache and disappointment — not to mention suicides, bankruptcies and divorces — and at this very moment the government-operated lottery is being investigated for serious allegations of wrongdoing. Next thing we hear, they'll be claiming that casino gambling will generate massive state financial aid, with little said about critical costs. Ask law enforcement folks concerning crime rates in current casino locales to see how that's working out, Mort moaned. Much of Mort's research is conducted following his perusal of newspapers left behind at the general store. The other day, he carefully clipped Kevin Sherrington's column from the Dallas Morning News, pinning it on the wall next to the cash register. He calls it classic, this piece that illuminates what is right about public education. Readers who don't shop there may review the column, posted by permission, on my website, tinyurl.com/5n82xabe With his huffing exceeded only by his puffing, my uncle left the general store. He headed for home on his golf cart, parking it at the swinging gate. Climbing over the gate to save the hinges, he went inside, hoping there'd be a slice of Maude's apple pie to sweeten his evening.|2025-03-16|https://www.oaoa.com/opinion/the-idle-american-mort-in-mourning/
It's easy to forget how fortunate we are to live in a state surrounded by such beauty. Not everyone can step outside their home and find themselves just a short walk or drive away from scenic wonders. Maine is One of the Most Beautiful States in America One of the most unique aspects of Maine's perfect nature is the wildlife that thrives here. And now, that wildlife is being recognized in a major way. The popular site Animals Around the Globe published an article all about America's remarkable wildlife. The site highlighted the 15 states with the most fascinating animal families, which (unsurprisingly) included Maine. Getty Images Maine Named One of the Best States for Wildlife In fact, the Pine Tree State ranked 11th for wildlife—an impressive position for Maine, a state that prides itself on its wondrous environment and diverse wildlife. Here is what Animals Around the Globe had to say about choosing Maine for this exclusive list. Moose, black bears, and white-tailed deer are commonly seen in the state's woodlands. Along the coast, you can find seals, puffins, and a range of seabirds. Acadia National Park offers excellent opportunities for observing Maine's wildlife. That brief write-up perfectly encapsulates what makes Maine so unique. The state's diverse landscape provides a welcoming environment for a wide variety of species. Grasslands, forests, wetlands, foothills, rocky mountains, and coastlines all offer habitats that best suit the needs of animals for sustainability. Getty Images Even with development seemingly out of control in some communities, much of the state remains wonderfully remote. Mainers are also fortunate to have numerous places where they can experience this wildlife firsthand. Whether it's one of the parks, beaches, hiking trails, or bodies of water, visitors have a great chance of witnessing Maine's exceptional animals. Getty Images While Maine may have missed out on the top 10, it's important to note that it was the only state in New England to receive recognition—just more evidence of how this state leaves the rest of the region in the dust. READ MORE: Maine's Moosehead Lake Earns Spot on Top U.S. Lakes List The number one spot on the list went to Alaska, which was undoubtedly the clear favorite. That state has more bears than people.

The days of making fun of American automotive engineering are long gone. We've been creating legendary performance cars for generations now. What America does so well is the execution of powertrains in a way that exudes emotion and power, and often in a package that is (relatively) affordable. Sure, European exotics have a long history of overshadowing Americans in terms of soulful vehicles, but not without facing an honest fight from the Wild West. As of recently, the massive rush towards electrification has taken a bit of a tumble as many drivers are realizing the massive cons in addition to the seemingly shiny pros to EV life as it exists right now. Because of that, many manufacturers are rolling back their EV projections/goals. This means ICE powertrains have, once again, received a new lease on life. Over the decades, American manufacturers have been able to create some of the most impressive engines out of fear it may be the last hurrah . We've heard it time and time again about how there will never be another (insert insane engine here), but then, somehow, they pull it off just in time to wow the world again. The following engines aren't all swan songs, but more so, a nod to the brilliance of American automotive engineering, especially within the last 3 decades. 2010 Ford Mustang GT, front 3/4 Related How reliable are performance cars? These ten models are some of the most reliable used performance cars you'll find when you want driving fun. To give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturers and other authoritative sources, including Roadandtrack.com. Entries were chosen based on prominence, impact on enthusiast communities, and innovation. 10 Ford Coyote 5.0-Liter V-8 The Modern Era Golden Standard It's the one everybody can't stop talking about. The 5.0-liter V-8 Coyote from Ford was re-introduced in 2011 but has been ingrained in enthusiasts' minds ever since. Ford is able to produce the same power as GM's small-block V-8 with over a liter less displacement. On top of that, the Coyote 5.0 is known for its robustness, welcoming tuning, and forced induction. Performance Specifications Engine 5.0-Liter V-8 Transmission 6-Speed Manual, 10-Speed Automatic Horsepower 412-500 HP Torque 390-418 LB-FT This engine can be found most famously in the Mustang GT. Now, in the Dark Horse variant of the GT, it makes an even 500 horsepower, which isn't far from Ford's last GT350, once their halo model. It can also be found under the hood of the F-150, Ford's bread-and-butter pickup. Folks in the USA have been tuning their Coyote F-150s for some time now, and the results of having high-horsepower, 4-wheel-drive, and 10 speeds to work with are quite incredible. There's little the 5.0 can't do and fully deserves the praise. Pros High-revving nature Relatively affordable horsepower Great noise Cons Thirsty Not as compact as some competitors Could use more torque 9 GM LS1 5.7-Liter V-8 The Golden Standard Of Yesterday Chevrolet C5 Corvette Z06 profile shot Ford's Coyote might be the performance standard of today, but how could we forget the performance standard of yesterday? GM's LS1 small-block V-8 is one of the most legendary engines ever produced, period. For nearly 30 years, the LS1 has powered everything from the Chevrolet Corvette to Camaros, Pontiac's GTO when they were still alive, and the list goes on. Performance Specifications Engine 5.7-Liter V-8 Transmission 6-Speed Manual, 4-Speed Automatic Horsepower 345-350 HP Torque 335-365 LB-FT The real reason the engine became famous, though, was its easy application to just about anything. GM brilliantly decided to make it their go-to crate engine and the world went wild. It was a triple threat; relatively cheap, very reliable (more than GM's more powerful LS6), and because of its compact packaging, can fit V-8 power where most can only fit V-6s. Pros Very punchy throughout the rev range Very affordable horsepower Very compact in size Cons Does not like to rev Can be difficult to cool Consumes oil 8 Czinger 2.88-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-8 An Engineering Leap Forward Czinger 21C engine bay opened at the rear. Czinger is not playing games when it comes to the design, construction, and repeatable manufacturing of complete vehicles. This includes their very impressive 2.88-liter twin-turbo V-8. It produces more power than some supercars, with less than half the displacement required from the engine. That's before you add Czinger's electric hybrid system to the ICE powertrain. Performance Specifications Engine 2.88-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-8 Transmission 7-Speed Sequential Horsepower 950 HP Torque 550 LB-FT This engine is a modern marvel, built from the ground up, by a company that is less than a decade old. I have personally heard the engine fire, and it certainly sounds the part up close. Czinger is constantly working on improvement and increasing efficiency both within their 21C hypercar, but also in their manufacturing. The ultra-compact, lightweight, and power-dense V-8 from Southern California is an engineer's dream come true. Pros Ground-up design Supremely powerful, especially per liter Compact Cons Expensive and intricate Unproven (yet) Difficult to obtain Chevrolet Camaro Fourth-Gen (2001) front 3/4 Related Get them while they're still cheap - the market is still to catch on to these sports cars, grand tourers, and coupes that offer speed and style. 7 GM LF4 3.6-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 The Unsung Hero 2023 blue Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing / ReVision Automedia America doesn't just make great eight-cylinders. We can do six, too. Case in point: GM's amazing little engine that could. The 3.6-liter twin-turbo LF4 is America's answer to BMW's B58. It's just as smooth, just as punchy, and even takes well to tuning. Currently, it's only found in one model, the Cadillac CT4-V Blackwing. This is a shame because it's so impressive. Performance Specifications Engine 3.6-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 Transmission 6-Speed Manual, 10-Speed Automatic Horsepower 472 HP Torque 445 LB-FT A company called Tapout Tuning is best known for LF4 enhancement and routinely ups these engines by hundreds of horsepower, not unlike our friends from Germany. LF4 even sounds good, too; many assimilate it loosely to, once again, that particular engine from our friends across the pond. It's a step towards refinement by Americans, and we're so glad it exists. Pros Punchy mid-range Great sound Refined feel (while driving) Cons Can consume oil Only found in one model Not available as a crate engine 6 Hennessey Fury 6.6-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-8 Everything Is Bigger In Texas Hennessey Venom Engine The Hennessey Venom F5 is the result of generations of learning done by the team at Hennessey. The Texan manufacturer now makes their very own hypercar after spending years modifying American muscle cars and sports cars. The Venom GT that came before it was a bit of a chopped-up Lotus Elise with an elongated body and ended up being a melting pot of parts. Not a bad thing, but the Venom F5 is a massively impressive ground-up design that was purpose-built to compete with the world's fastest cars. Henneseey Venom F5 Revolution in gray parked on road / Hennessey Performance Specifications Engine 6.6-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-8 Transmission 7-Speed Automatic, 6-Speed Manual Horsepower 1,817 HP Torque 1,193 LB-FT The engine was designed and built completely in-house by Hennessey, and is so powerful, it allowed for the name F5 to be a fitting tribute to F5-rated tornadoes. This is the highest level on the scale and measures wind speeds of up to 318 MPH, a speed that the Venom F5 was designed to reach. This engine eclipses any other series-produced gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, impressively, without the use of electrification. The folks at Hennessey have even just announced a manual transmission-equipped variant. Pros Astronomical power figures Impressive visually Roaring V-8 sound Cons Unproven long-term reliability Bulky Very expensive 5 Stellantis 6.2-Liter Hellcat V-8 The Smokiest Of Burnouts Engine of 2023 Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat Jailbreak / Mecum Few automotive trends swept the nation quite like the Hellcat craze. Known for their hilarious power delivery and unbelievable power figures, any Hellcat variant will forever be known as a force to be reckoned with. Dodge's initial goals were to reach the 600-650 horsepower range with their then-new 6.2-liter supercharged V-8. Instead, they shocked the world with over 700. That number, 707, was soon ingrained in muscle car enthusiasts' minds. Performance Specifications Engine 6.2-Liter Supercharged V-8 Transmission 6-Speed Manual, 8-Speed Automatic Horsepower 707-1025 HP Torque 707-945 LB-FT There was even a time when Dodge was advertising a lease deal for Hellcat-powered challengers and chargers for 707/month . There have always been leaps in performance over vehicle generations, but never has this much power been so accessible. These are power figures traditionally reserved for upper echelon sports cars and supercars. Dodge took the status quo and did a football field-sized burnout all over it. Pros Instant shove of power Supercharger whine High availability Cons Some variants have reliability issues Heavy Thirsty Cons Some variants have reliability issues Heavy Thirsty 10-Turbocharged-Cars-That-Still-H Related They said the turbocharged era would kill vehicle values due to complexity and reliability issues. Here are ten reasons that's not the case. 4 Ford EcoBoost 3.5-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 Death Of The V-8 The Blue and Red 2023 Ford GT MK IV The 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 was one of Ford's first in the family of downsized and turbocharged engines. They were introduced as a way to theoretically cut down on fuel when needed while providing a massive hit of turbocharged power when requested. The 3.5-liter variant made its way into vehicles of all types. It debuted in both the Ford Taurus and F-150 pickup as a direct replacement for V-8 options. Performance Specifications Engine 3.5-Liter Twin-Turbocharged V-6 Transmission 10-Speed Automatic, 7-Speed DCT Horsepower 365-800+ HP Torque 420-550 LB-FT The Mustang never saw this engine, but the latest generation Ford GT exclusively uses a version that has been extensively reworked. This showcases the versatility of the engine and how appropriate it can be for multiple vehicle types. It has routinely been the most powerful option in the lineup and continues to lead Ford into the next generation of vehicles. Since its inception, the EcoBoost family has grown with engines as small as 1.0-liter three-cylinders making their way into Fords across the pond. Pros Compact design Can handle high boost levels High availability Cons Lacks some character Early variants can be laggy Some early reliability issues 3 GM LT4 6.2-Liter Supercharged V-8 The Crate Engine Of The Moment Front 3/4 shot of a 2023 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 The LT4 from GM picks up where the LS1 left off. One walk-through of the SEMA show in Las Vegas will show you just how popular the engine has become for builders. Even GM still uses it. Cadillac's CT5-V Blackwing and Escalade V models use it. Performance Specifications Engine 6.2-Liter Supercharged V-8 Transmission 6-Speed Manual, 10-Speed Automatic Horsepower 650-682 HP Torque 650-653 LB-FT The engine is a hand-built masterpiece, making power basically from idle. It's the perfect all-American brute that shakes and rumbles anything it's in. It idles with a slight lope to it, reminiscent of the muscle car heydays. It can be found in last-generation Corvettes and Camaros, too, representing massive horsepower per dollar. It may not be as compact or inexpensive as an LS1, but the performance trade-off is well worth it. Pros Power everywhere in the rev range Glorious noises Many available applications Cons Early reliability issues Thirsty Low redline 2 Ford Voodoo 5.2-Liter V-8 America Does A Flat-Plane Crank A red 2016 Ford Mustang GT350R Hands down, this was a mic-drop moment for Ford. The Raptor was just getting started, the new GT was launching, and then we mere mortals received a bat out of hell. That was the 2015 Shelby GT350 with America's first mass-produced flat-plane crank V-8. What the new engine lacked in reliability more than makes up for in theater. Performance Specifications Engine 5.2-Liter V-8 Transmission 6-Speed Manual Horsepower 526 HP Torque 429 LB-FT An 8,250 RPM redline, a specific firing order, and specially tuned exhaust create an experience that is unlike anything else in the world. A true screamer, but in a way only a Mustang could pull off. It's a truly unique powertrain strapped to a good ol' Tremec 6-speed manual. The Voodoo 5.2-liter, as it's called, completely changed the world's perspective on American automotive engineering. It was an exotic take on muscle cars, given to one of the most iconic American cars ever made. Pros Unique sound 8,000+ redline Fairly linear power Cons Major reliability issues Not very compact Expensive Front 3/4 of the 2010 BMW X5 M Related Performance and speed typically increase the price of vehicles, but these ten used high-performance SUVs cost less than a new Toyota RAV4. 1 GM LT6 5.5-Liter V-8 America Does A Flat-Plane Crank (Reliably) 2024 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 LT6 engine When GM saw what Ford did with the flat-plane crankshaft design, suddenly it was an option as a solution for the C8-generation Corvette Z06. As we know, though, it's not about who does it first, but who does it best. The 5.5-liter LT6 V-8 is certainly one of the best, not just in America, but on a global scale. Performance Specifications Engine 5.5-Liter V-8 Transmission 8-Speed DCT Horsepower 670 HP Torque 460 LB-FT This engine seems to be heavily modeled after Ferrari's 4.5-liter V-8 found in the 458 Italia. Arguably, one of Ferrari's best engines ever, the LT6 features many of the tricks used on that powertrain. That engine produced 570 horsepower, but that wasn't good enough. GM wanted more, and so they developed a flat-plane engine that some said could never work. The result was an engine that was a full liter larger than Ferrari's, produced far more power, and could still rev to an amazing 8,600 RPM redline. It's more reliable and powerful than Ford's, too. It may not have a signature sound like the Voodoo, but since when does a wailing Z06 ever sound bad? It's the perfect engine for an American supercar that is climbing upmarket, and it arrived just in time. Pros Very high redline Power-dense Unique sound Cons Early reliability issues Thirsty Not easily modifiable|2025-03-16|https://www.topspeed.com/best-engines-ever-built-by-american-carmakers/
The Record) / 01-holy-family-time-capsule-louisville / Aerial view of the Holy Family campus. (Courtesy Google) In January, we reported on the demolition of the Holy Family convent on Poplar Level Road to make way for the new headquarters of the Louisville Catholic Archdiocese. In Bryan Grumley's report, he lamented not just the loss of a historic three-story brick structure but also the embodied energy the building represented and the larger throw-away culture that has made it easy to toss old buildings in the landfill. But since the structure has been razed, an unexpected but of history has surfaced in the form of a recovered time capsule. According to Jessica Albe of the Catholic newspaper The Record, the capsule, dating to 1949, was hidden inside the structure's cornerstone. Aerial view of the Holy Family campus. (Courtesy Google) / The convent before demolition. (Bryan Grumley / Broken Sidewalk) The time capsule, a surprise to church leadership, was opened by Deacon Patrick Wright, according to Albe, who found a Mass card and other items that shed light on the culture of Holy Family in the late '40s. When I hear people talk about the convent, they connect it with the sisters and the school. It's always been a part of the landscape there, Wright told Albe, noting the bittersweet feelings about tearing down the building. In a sense, a piece of history is gone with the building. The time capsule helps to reconnect some of the history of the building. The convent before demolition. (Bryan Grumley / Broken Sidewalk) The Catholic Church saved two small elements of former convent: a stained-glass section once suspended over a doorway to the former convent and the cornerstone previously mentioned, which will ultimately end up in a garden space on the parish campus. The site of the former convent will make way for the new , housing offices and other departments for the church. A new time capsule will be included in the new building.

iStock/TrongNguyen A Pennsylvania court has ruled in favor of a mother challenging her children's public school district after it denied her request for information about the taxpayer-funded Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion materials used to train students and faculty. A three-judge panel from the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania ruled late last month that the Downingtown Area School District provided insufficient evidence to support its denial of a mom of three Ann Trethewey's 2023 request for materials being used to instruct her children and their teachers. The district claimed the information is exempt from disclosure because it constitutes or reveals a trade secret or confidential proprietary information. However, the court ruled that DEI materials are not trade secrets since they are openly shared with employees and can't be considered a trade secret. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. A trade secret is essential to the product, but it is not the product itself, the majority opinion, written by President Judge Emerita Mary Hannah Leavitt, states. For example, Coca Cola uses a secret formula to create its product known as 'Coke.' [The author] did not identify a 'formula' or 'algorithm' that was the secret to the creation of his product, which is DEI training material. Because that product is widely shared to School District employees, it is not secret. Attorneys with the Goldwater Institute's American Freedom Network helped the mother challenge the school district's decision with the state Office of Open Records. The AFN works closely with the conservative and libertarian Goldwater Institute on cases dealing with issues like free speech and taxpayer rights. Trethewey filed the public records request in January 2023 for all documents and materials (paper or electronic) and all presentations used by the DEI program director and DEI staff to instruct or lead any training or programs to any staff, teacher, counselor or student in the school district. In rejecting her request, the district's DEI director, Justin Brown, asserted that he created the materials before he started working with the district. He argued that disclosing the materials would cause him substantial commercial and competitive harm. The appellate court called for the trial court to conduct a hearing on the issue of whether the confidential proprietary information exemption contained in Section 708(b)(11) of the RTKL applies to the DEI training materials. Wally Zimolong, one of the mother's attorneys, celebrated the ruling as a crucial victory in the fight for parental rights and government transparency. But the fight to protect parental rights isn't over. School districts across the country continue to use secrecy, including unfounded claims of trade secrets and proprietary information, as a shield to push ideological agendas, the attorney said in a statement provided to The Christian Post. We must remain vigilant and persistent in defending transparency, because parents have a right to know what their children are being taught in taxpayer-funded schools, he continued. The Downingtown Area School District did not immediately respond to The Christian Post's request for comment. The debate over parental rights in education has continued to make headlines, mainly as President Donald Trump and his administration take steps to eliminate certain educational policies. Last month, the Education Department's Office of Civil Rights sent a letter to academic institutions and state education agencies that receive federal funding, warning that these institutions could lose federal funding if they did not eliminate their DEI programs by the deadline. The Department will no longer tolerate the overt and covert racial discrimination that has become widespread in this Nation's educational institutions. The law is clear: treating students differently on the basis of race to achieve nebulous goals such as diversity, racial balancing, social justice, or equity is illegal under controlling Supreme Court precedent, the document stated. On Feb. 17, the department announced it had terminated over $600 million in grants, which included awards to teacher preparation programs that the agency said contained inappropriate and unnecessary topics. The topics cited as inappropriate included critical race theory, anti-racism and social justice activism. Samantha Kamman is a reporter for The Christian Post.

PETTIS CO., Mo. (KCTV) - A 20-year-old is behind bars after a 130+ mph chase along a Missouri highway led State Troopers to find a handful of firearms and methamphetamine. Pettis County, Missouri, Circuit Court records filed on Wednesday, March 12, indicate that Maxwell J. Payette, 20, of Sedalia, has been charged after narcotics were found during the search of a vehicle involved in a high-speed chase. A probable cause statement filed by the Missouri State Highway Patrol indicates that just after 9:45 a.m. on Wednesday, law enforcement officials spotted a blue Toyota Camry travelling at 130 mph along Highway 65 near Bothwell Park Rd. As State Troopers attempted to stop the driver, later identified as Payette, they said he sped up even faster, ran a red light and drove onto the shoulder of the highway where he lost control of his vehicle. Investigators noted that the Camry collided with a vehicle not involved in the chase and crashed into the ditch where Payette was arrested. During a search of the vehicle, a pistol, a revolver, a rifle and methamphetamine were all found. As a result, Payette has been charged with aggravated fleeing a stop, four counts of armed criminal action, possession of a controlled substance, two counts of unlawful possession of a firearm, unlawful use of a weapon and leaving the scene of an accident. As of Saturday, March 15, Payette remains behind bars with no bond listed. A court appearance has been scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, March 18. A mugshot has not been made available and no further information has been released.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/130-mph-chase-leads-mans-arrest-after-firearms-methamphetamine-found/

On March 15, 1942, Emery Whilton opened up a public-private museum and hotel. One of the weirder footnotes in local history is Emery M. Wilton's short-lived Florafaunium, a public-private museum in Lebec. As the name implies, it housed a massive collection of stuffed animals and plants mostly native to California. Whilton was born in Indiana in 1879, came to California in 1909 and settled in Tulare, where he opened a hotel in 1922. A hunter, he filled his hotel with a growing assortment of birds and mammals, most of which he shot himself and some of which, like grizzly bear and California condor, became extinct or nearly so during his lifetime. Meanwhile his daughter amassed a diverse variety of wildflowers and by the late 1930, their accumulation of California flora and fauna was considered the most complete collection of its kind. In the late 1930s, Whilton shopped around for a new home for the collection, evidently seeking out the best deal. There were at least three suitors: General Grant National Park in Fresno and Tulare counties (renamed King's Canyon National Park in 1940); the county of Los Angeles; and the county of Kern, The latter won the day. On a controversial three to two vote, the Kern County Board of Supervisors agreed to acquire the San Joaquin Valley building from the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939 to 1940 (San Francisco World's Fair) and move it from Treasure Island to Lebec. The owners of Hotel Lebec and neighboring Richfield gas station donated the land to the county for the purpose. The property was located just south of the coffee shop, directly behind the California Historic Landmark plaque that was installed in 1938 for the Spanish explorer Pedro Fages. At a cost of $10,000, the building was dismantled in San Francisco and shipped to Lebec where it was reassembled by a county inmate crew. The Florafaunium opened in 1942 on the Ides of March. The County owned the building and Whilton owned the collection. The taxidermied animals were arranged in dioramas of habitats, replicating their natural settings. Under the operating agreement, Whilton charged admission of 25 cents for adults and 10 cents for children, paid 10 percent of proceeds to the county and in 20 years the county would own the collection. Whilton died on March 22, 1945 in Tulare and his widow Edna took over the museum operations but it wasn't profitable and she wanted out. In 1949, she tried selling the collection to Kern County for $100,000, her husband's estimated cost of amassing the collection over 30 years. After nearly a year of negotiations, while the animal displays started to disintegrate, the county finally agreed on $10,000 and moved the collection to the Kern County Museum, where Frank Latta was the museum director.

OLYMPIA — A key deadline in the Washington state Legislature passed on Wednesday, requiring bills to pass their house of origin in order to advance this session. Republicans and Democrats on Thursday shared some of the successes — and some of the failures — of the session so far. We are feeling really happy about our work in the first half, said Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle. Democrats, who control both the House and the Senate, say they are overall satisfied with the issues lawmakers have tackled, and that they were pleased with their work so far specifically surrounding K-12 and special education funding. Democrats noted they were pleased with the work done around affordable housing including a bill to cap rents at 7%, a transit-oriented development bill, a bill to permit lot-splitting and a bill to eliminate requirements on parking for new housing developments. While Democrats weren't thrilled to see Republicans forgo raises for state employees in their budget proposal released this week, they said Democratic budget leaders plan to incorporate some of the ideas into their own budget proposal, set to be released on March 24. Republicans did not seem quite as optimistic, but House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, R-Auburn, said it was encouraging that Republicans played a hand in killing off bills they believed to be bad, such as legislation to reduce penalties for gun crimes, and early release for violent offenders. Republicans wanted more legislation to provide public safety and affordability, but did not make a lot of progress in solving those problems. But we did make some progress in ensuring the problems didn't get dramatically worse, Stokesbary said. Though they were disappointed to see a Republican-sponsored Senate bill to allocate $100 million to hire more law enforcement officers in the state die, Republicans said they are glad to see that a similar House version of the bill is still in play. That bill is sponsored by several Republicans and Democrats. They reiterated their concerns over Democrats' push for new taxes as the focus of the second part of the legislative session turns to balancing the state budget. On Wednesday, House lawmakers debated House Bill 1296 as their final bill for the night. Debate started hours after the 5 p.m. cutoff time and stretched into the early morning hours, ending after 2 a.m. on Thursday. While Democrats say the bill aligns provisions of the Parent's Bill of Rights passed in Initiative 2081 last year, Republicans say the measure undermines those provisions. The bill passed with a 56-37 vote, five excused. House lawmakers also tackled several other bills Wednesday, including a bill to allow property tax exemptions for more veterans with service-connected disabilities, a bill to refine fuel exemptions under the Climate Commitment Act and a bill to expand insurance coverage requirements for prosthetic limbs. Senate lawmakers ended much earlier in the day, ending on Senate Bill 5263 to increase special education funding by $2 billion over the next four years. The measure, sponsored by Pedersen and Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, passed the Senate 48-0. The Senate also passed a bill to allow the Public Works Board to provide loans for broadband infrastructure repair and replacement, a bill to allow incarcerated individuals access to midwife or doula services and legislation to expand civics and media literacy in student curriculums. Dead … for now Still, not all bills made the cutoff on Wednesday. A bill to limit the governor's emergency powers was introduced this year by Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, and a mix of Republican and Democratic senators. But while Gov. Bob Ferguson said in his inaugural address that he would support the reform, ultimately the legislation this year did not pass. Sen. Shelly Short, R-Addy, on Thursday said the changes by Democrats in the Senate State Government, Tribal Affairs and Elections Committee made the current policy on emergency powers worse — watering down the existing law. Despite the bill's failure, Ferguson took it upon himself Tuesday to rein in his own emergency powers while he is in office, stating he believes reform is necessary to protect Washingtonians during emergencies. Wagoner commended the governor's move in a statement, and said he welcomed the governor's approach, adding that it shows Ferguson's understanding of the issue and the role the Legislature plays. This is a win for Washington's citizens but, it is a perishable win, Wagoner said. The Legislature needs to codify similar provisions into law. Another bill that would have stopped the Washington Department of Children, Youth, and Families from intercepting Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income from foster youth did not pass the Senate chamber before the deadline. Democrats noted earlier in the session that getting the bill over the multibillion-dollar hurdle would be a difficult task. Also missing the cutoff was another attempt by Senate and House lawmakers to lower the maximum allowable blood alcohol concentration for drivers — from 0.08% to 0.05% — as DUI deaths have risen in Washington.|2025-03-16|https://www.yakimaherald.com/key-bills-die-as-wa-legislature-passes-house-of-origin-cutoff/article_b19ca37b-1bf0-574a-84c8-fa8a91c2abf0.html
Privacy has become a priority for virtually every company regardless of size, vertical, and geography. Privacy regulations have popped up around the world, including Europe, the US, and China. India will soon be added to the list. Rising customers' and employees' privacy expectations are also converging to force businesses to prioritize privacy and will keep doing so in the future. Companies are responding by maturing their privacy programs, developing best practices, and sharpening their respective toolkits. Companies are investing in privacy According to Forrester survey data, most companies worldwide have adopted a formal privacy program and have a chief privacy officer (CPO) in place. Half of these CPOs report directly to the company's CEO. While privacy programs are primarily set up to deliver on compliance requirements, one of the key benefits companies report as a result of their program is increased customer trust. With the volume of individuals' privacy rights requests on the rise, new requirements being discussed, and emerging risks to tackle, privacy decision-makers expect to increase their privacy budgets in the next 12 months. The appetite for adopting new technology is also rising. While most teams are still relying on spreadsheets to manage their programs, privacy teams are progressively investing in more sophisticated and automated technology to support their efforts. Encryption is one of the main technologies being implemented today. Privacy-preserving technologies, as well as software for privacy training, top the list of new tools privacy decision-makers are planning to adopt in the next future. The reliance on automated technology helps privacy organizations perform better. However, to solve their most significant challenges, they need to think about processes, governance, and policies on top of technology. And they need to establish strategic collaboration with others in the organization. In fact, when asked about the biggest challenges to effectively protect the personal data of their customers and/or employees, most privacy decision-makers reported that the fear of worsening the experience of their customers and/or employees is their biggest challenge. Also: Privacy predictions for Europe Employee privacy expectations are greater than most assume Companies have learned that EX -- the employee experience -- directly influences the quality of their customer experience (CX). As such, they are prioritizing efforts to improve their EX. But employee privacy is still too often left out from the list of key EX -- and privacy -- initiatives. This is a mistake. How companies treat their personal information has a significant impact on how employees feel about and trust their employers and on how they perform. Employees have strong privacy expectations at work. In fact, data from Forrester's new Privacy Segmentation shows that as many as 72% of employees globally do not want their personal data used as part of workforce analytics projects without their consent. Additionally, more than half wish they had more privacy protections in the workplace. About the same number take active measures to limit the amount of personal data they share with their employers. Companies and their privacy leaders must learn how their employees feel about their personal data at work and develop privacy practices that meet these expectations. Those that understand employee privacy only as a compliance requirement should upgrade their existing practices to address employees' privacy attitudes beyond mere compliance. Compliance is the floor, not the ceiling. And those that have existing strong employee privacy practices in place must ensure that they continuously improve them to align with changing employee privacy expectations. Organizations can help empower employees with privacy at home Employee privacy concerns and interests intersect with their personal lives. The lines start to blur between work and home as companies move to an anywhere work model and have a remote workforce. Companies will have a ceiling when it comes to applying cybersecurity controls that reach into the home. Employees have expectations of privacy; employers have liability concerns, and privacy and labor laws are non-negotiable. To keep privacy top of mind and engage your workforce, you can be a resource for information to empower your employees to level up their personal privacy posture. For example, point to how a credit freeze can help prevent identity theft. This can also include education about tools like VPNs and identity theft monitoring and protection services. You can also highlight privacy and anti-surveillance tools. For example, email and credit card masking tools like Abine and MySudo; secure messaging apps like Signal; and popup blockers and script blockers like Adblock, Ghostery, NoScript, and uBlock Origin. Many ISPs also offer home cybersecurity services today as well. These services are typically delivered via the home router and include capabilities like network and device security, Wi-Fi/network management and optimization, parental controls, and privacy features. Concierge cybersecurity and privacy services like BlackCloak and Cypient Black will take a tailored approach to protect individuals (typically executives and VIPs) from targeted attacks aimed at their home environment.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-future-of-work-employee-privacy/

'A year to build foundation': Philly's Mexican Indigenous communities celebrate the Mexica New Year The Indigenous tradition marks the start of the year in the Aztec calendar. By Emily Neil From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know! Mexican Indigenous community members from Philadelphia and surrounding areas gathered Saturday to celebrate the Mexica New Year, which marks the start of the Aztec calendar. Fragrant smoke from burning copal, or tree resin, filled the warehouse in South Philadelphia. Participants twirled in traditional attire around an altar centered on the symbol for this year — Calli, a Nahuatl word that means house, and 13, which is a sacred number in Aztec and Mexica culture. Drummers kept the beat as children and adults formed a circle in the large room and danced facing the four cardinal directions to welcome in the new year. Javier Santamaría said it's the third year he, Ollin Pineda, artist César Viveros and others have collaborated to celebrate the Mexica New Year in Philadelphia. In that time, the celebration has grown. Para mí el hacer este tipo de celebración en Filadelfia, con la comunidad que está aquí de México y de otros lugares, es como para hacernos sentirse orgullosos y profundizar más en su raíz, sentirse como estuviéramos en México , dijo él. For me, doing this type of celebration in Philadelphia, with the community that's here from Mexico and other places, it's to make us feel proud and go deeper in our roots, to feel as if we were in Mexico, he said. Pineda and her husband, Santamaría, are members of the Mexica and Aztec dance group Kalpulli Kamaxtle Xiuhcóatl. She said the celebrations allow her the opportunity to share the tradition with her children. She's from the state of Mexico, in the central part of the country, where the Mexica New Year is widely celebrated. Nosotros como mexicanos necesitamos tener nuestras raíces en nuestro corazón , dijo ella. Forjar más nuestra identidad. Ya que estamos lejos de nuestro país nos provoca también una pérdida. Sin embargo, nuestra cultura nos enriquece y nos vuelve a llenar el corazón con mucha felicidad . We as Mexicans need to have our roots in our heart, to shape our identity more, she said. Since we're far from our country it causes loss for us, but our culture enriches us and it allows us to fill our hearts again with joy. Pineda said the new year tradition is rooted in the close relationship her ancestors shared with the seasons and the land. The new calendar year reflected the start of the agricultural season in springtime. De hecho nuestros ancestros estaban muy ligados a todo lo que es la cosmovisión, sobretodo de los elementales de la naturaleza , dijo ella. Todo va relacionado. Va unido . Our ancestors were actually very connected to everything that is the cosmovision, above all the elements of nature, she said. Everything's related. It goes together. Adniel Avendano participated at the event as a dancer and as a vendor selling merchandise from his company, Nocheztli, which celebrates different Indigenous and pre-Hispanic cultures in Mexico. Avendano said although he is from Oaxaca, and is more at home with Zapotec Indigenous traditions, the Mexica New Year is a way to connect with elements of another Mexican Indigenous culture that are familiar to him. It's interconnected but at the same time it's different, he said. Eva Mayhabal Davis agreed that Saturday's event celebrated and welcomed the diversity of different cultures and traditions within Mexico. What's really important to remember is that in Mexico, there are over 68 spoken languages. There's a multiple, multiple, multiple, innumerable amount of communities and Indigenous communities, and each one of us has our roots somewhere, she said. And so I didn't grow up with these exact practices, but I grew up around this kind of smudging. I saw danza in the plaza of the pueblo that I grew up in. And everybody here has some connection. And as part of that, it's about the work, it's about studying it too, right? It's about relearning, asking your parents, asking your grandparents, remembering that you've come from a place. People came from as far as Georgia and North Carolina to attend Saturday's celebrations. Mayhabal Davis, from Cetiliztli Nahucampa in New York City, was one of several people who traveled across state lines. When you receive an invitation to such an important event and an important feast, you do your due diligence and willingness to be here when you're invited to someone's home, which in this case, that's how it feels, she said. And it's also relevant because of the year that it is. It's the house, it's home, it's Calli. It's a year to build foundation, to build strong community. So that's why everyone's here. Saturdays just got more interesting. Busy week? Our weekend newsletter will catch you up on the best local stories of the week.

President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming, with the organization's director saying all VOA employees have been put on leave. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. On Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave. For the first time in 83 years, the storied Voice of America is being silenced, Michael Abramowitz, the organization's director, said in a statement. He added that virtually the entire 1300-person staff was placed on leave. VOA promotes freedom and democracy around the world by telling America's story and by providing objective and balanced news and information, especially for those living under tyranny, Abramowitz said. One reporter, who spoke under the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press, said: We expected something like this to happen, and it just happened to be today. The press advocacy group Reporters Without Borders said it condemns this decision as a departure from the U.S.'s historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the U.S. government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move. The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia. The cancellation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's grant agreement would be a massive gift to America's enemies, said the network's President and CEO, Stephen Capus, in a statement. Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. influence and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump. Thomas Kent, former president and CEO of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, said that Trump's intentions for the agencies are still foggy. Without these news sources, it will be that much harder for the country to get its messages to the world, he said. Without the international broadcasting, the image of the United States and the Trump administration will be in the hands of others, including the administration's opponents, (and) countries and people who consider the United States an enemy, said Kent, an international consultant on media ethics. A video posted on X by Lake on Saturday talked about cost-cutting measures, not mentioning the employees and the mission of Voice of America. Her video was made at a building leased by VOA that Lake described as a waste of money. She said she would try to break the agency's 15-year lease on the building. We're doing everything we can to cancel contracts that can be cancelled, save more, downsize and make sure there's no misuse of your dollars, she said. The letter places employees on administrative leave and says staff would continue to receive pay and benefits until otherwise notified. It ordered employees not to use Agency for Global Media facilities and return equipment like phones and computers. The Trump administration has already made other steps to assert its authority over Voice of America, and this week cancelled contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organizations, such as The Associated Press. The administration has also banned the AP from press pools that cover the president and moved to take charge of what news organizations are members of the pools, and the FCC is investigating news organizations like CBS. Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.newspressnow.com/news/national_news/trump-signs-order-to-gut-staff-at-voice-of-america-and-other-us-funded-media/article_0f1f9ead-2076-5057-84e2-63dd2b2bc15f.html

Donovan said. TopicsCarriersAutoClaimsProperty Casualty Claims errors continue to be the most frequent reason that property/casualty insurers are cited by regulators when responding to market conduct complaints or during routine examinations, according to a report by Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions. Kathy Donovan, lead researcher for Wolters Kluwer, said she found state regulators took 270 market-conduct enforcement actions against property/casualty insurers for claims violations in 2019. Those resulted in $4,675,000 in fines. Failure to meet deadlines for acknowledging, investigating, paying or denying claims was the No. 1 criticism by regulators, she said. Failure to pay the correct amount or send complaint denial notices was No. 2, failure to provide correct claims processing notices and disclosures was No. 3 and failure to properly process total-loss claims was No. 4. Wolters Kluwer's Top 10 Market Conduct Criticisms of P/C Insurers Failure to acknowledge, pay, investigate or deny claims within specified timeframes. Failure to issue correct payments and/or compliant denial notices. Failure to provide required compliant notices and disclosures in claims processing. Failure to process total loss claims properly. Improper/incomplete documentation of underwriting files. Using unapproved/unfiled rates and rules or misapplying rating factors. Failure to cancel, non-renew, decline policies in accordance with requirements. Failure to adhere to producer appointment, termination, records, reporting and/or licensing requirements. Improper/incomplete documentation of claim files. Failure to provide required compliant notices and disclosures in underwriting process.Donovan gives a detailed presentation on the findings in a webinar: Top 10 Property & Casualty Market Conduct Issues of 2019. Donovan said during a telephone interview that it should be no surprise that claims would be the most common reason that insurers get dinged by regulators, given the tight deadlines, numerous notices required and exacting standards established for the amounts that are paid on claims. She said most of the criticisms cited by regulators could have been resolved by more careful attention to proper documentation. A lot of it goes back to documentation that proves what they've done, when they've done it and how they've done it, she said during a telephone interview on Friday. For example, Donovan said many states require claims to be paid or denied within specific timeframes, often 30 or 45 days. Insurers can extend those deadlines but they are required to send notices to the policyholders explaining why they are taking longer to resolve the claim. Sometimes delay notices are sent with no explanation, and sometimes no delay notice is sent at all. Donovan said auto claims are frequently delayed because the collision repair shop uncovers additional damage after beginning work, requiring a supplemental report. In a homeowner's claim, the adjuster may hold up on a file because an inventory of damaged personal items has not been received. Those are both valid reasons, but the adjuster needs to notify the claimant on the reason for the delay. The purpose of those requirements is to keep the claimant informed, Donovan explained. Documentation is especially important when insurers determine values in total loss cases. Donovan said many states require insurers to pay the cost of licensing and registration fees, but insurers write a check for the value of the car without documenting any extra money to cover those costs. Similarly, when a policyholder chooses to hold on to a wrecked car, some states require that the owner be reimbursed for the cost of obtaining a salvage title. Donovan said she saw one instance where an insurer was cited for failing to add that $6 cost to its payout. Sometimes insurers do a poor job of explaining how they arrived at a vehicle's value. Donovan said California regulators cited one insurer that provided documentation of comparable sales prices for 16 vehicles, but only three of the vehicles were within a 100-mile radius of the policyholder's residence in San Diego. Other errors cited by regulators include: In Illinois, an insurer denied a claim and gave proper notice on time, but failed to give notice to the policyholder that he has a right to contact the state Department of Insurance. In California, an insurer improperly applied depreciation to overhead and profit when calculating the value of a property damage claim. In Connecticut, an insurer was cited for setting unreasonable and arbitrary limits on reimbursement for paint and materials for vehicle repairs. In West Virginia, an insurer recommended that a claimant file a claim against his own insurer instead of the insurer for the other vehicle involved in the crash, which is prohibited. The Wolters Kluwer report said claims have consistently been the leading source of regulator citations against insurers during the 16 years that the company has been studying market conduct actions. Certainly, claims — with all of their moving parts in all of the lines of business — still present compliance challenges, Donovan said.

On Thursday, Assemblywoman Pilar Schiavo announced the introduction of the Roads to Resilience Act, AB 1132, a critical piece of legislation designed to prioritize the needs of communities disproportionately impacted by climate disasters. Southern California faced devastating wildfires that have claimed at least 25 lives, displaced tens of thousands, left nearly 90,000 households without electricity, and destroyed an estimated 12,000 homes and other structures. The need for climate-resilient infrastructure that not only withstands climate impacts, but also supports vulnerable populations during crises, has never been clearer. The Community Roads to Resilience Act is set to ensure the state incorporates community resilience into state transportation planning, prioritizing the needs of underserved populations with the highest climate impact risk—such as those without access to personal vehicles, the elderly, and people with disabilities—during emergencies like wildfires. This is expected involve evaluating how climate disruptions to roads and bridges impact access to essential services like healthcare, education, and employment, and assessing evacuation strategies for people without personal vehicles. In the midst of life-threatening disasters like the wildfires that have devastated communities throughout Los Angeles County, transportation infrastructure is not just about roads and bridges; it is our connection to safety and life-saving essential services, said Assemblywoman Schiavo. The Roads to Resilience Act will better equip us to protect the lives of people disproportionately impacted by disasters, including our first responders, and the infrastructure we all rely on. The wildfire crisis underscores the urgent need for better evacuation planning. In both urban areas like Los Angeles and rural areas, people without access to cars are particularly vulnerable, such as low-income individuals, seniors, and those with disabilities. For example, in the Eaton Canyon fire, a father and son who both use wheelchairs lost their lives, despite calling emergency services to be evacuated from their home. Even when residents were able to evacuate by car, road closures and gridlock left many trapped. During the Pacific Palisades fire, thousands were caught in gridlock, forced to abandon their cars, and many evacuees had to flee on foot, creating dangerous conditions that delayed emergency responses and put lives at risk. The tragic wildfires are a stark reminder that our transportation systems must do more than withstand climate impacts–they must ensure our communities can safely evacuate when life-threatening disaster strikes, said Yesenia Perez, Program Manager at The Greenlining Institute. Marginalized groups often face the greatest risks in times of crisis due to legacies of disinvestment that have left them with less reliable infrastructure. We cannot afford to leave our most vulnerable communities behind as we plan and rebuild for a more climate-resilient future. This bill ensures that transportation investments protect the physical infrastructure and the people who depend on it. The ongoing wildfires in Southern California are a clear reminder of the need to invest in and plan for community resilience, said Chloe Ames, Policy Advisor at NextGen California. The Roads to Resilience Act provides a framework for California transportation agencies to plan for and build a more equitable and resilient system that Californians know they can rely on in the midst of climate crises. Co-sponsored by The Greenlining Institute and NextGen California, The Roads to Resilience Act addresses the urgent need for a more resilient approach to California's transportation system and protects the communities that depend on it. By prioritizing resilience and thoughtfully approaching transportation planning, this bill is a vital step in safeguarding Californians against the growing threat of climate change. Ed.

President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 Saturday to target members of a Venezuelan gang for mass deportations, just hours after a federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump couldn't use the law as a means to deport five Venezuelans. Trump claims the U.S. is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang – Tren de Aragua (TdA) – and the sweeping war time law will give the president broader leeway to deport what he says is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela's government. What they're saying: I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States, Trump wrote in the declaration. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Expand US President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base March 14, 2025, in Maryland. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (Photo b Trump's invocation of the law could allow for faster mass deportations of people in the country illegally – potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798? The backstory: The Alien Enemies Act allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a country that is considered an enemy of the United States during wartime. Congress passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 when the U.S. was about to go to war with France. The law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used, but Trump appears to have invoked the law without such declaration. The sweeping authority of the Alien Enemies Act may sidestep a law that bans the military from civilian law enforcement. Why did Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798? Dig deeper: On Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington – before Trump invoked the law – contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a predatory incursion by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts. James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was to preserve the status quo. Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. Trump had widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act. The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it will likely face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime. The other side: Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport, said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night. When was the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 last used? The controversial law was last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he's kicking out the new Ambassador from South Africa — accusing him of hating America and hating Donald Trump. It's the latest salvo against South Africa, which has been in the administration's crosshairs since Trump took office in January. In a fiery post on X on Friday, Secretary Rubio called Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool a race baiting politician and said he was considered a persona non grata. Rubio's ire came after Rasool said in an online seminar hosted by a South African think tank that the MAGA movement was partially in response to worries about demographic change and a future when white Americans would no longer be the majority. So in terms of that — the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement — the Make America Great Again movement — as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon, said Rasool. The South African government on Saturday scrambled to contain the fallout, issuing a short, terse statement. Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for the South African president, called the ambassador's expulsion regrettable. We urge all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter, he said. South Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America. Things have been tense between the two allies, after Trump falsely accused the South African government of confiscating land from white farmers and invited white Afrikaners to resettle in the US as refugees. Thirty years since the end of apartheid most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority. The government recently passed a bill aimed at addressing that, but contrary to Trump's claim, no land has been seized. South Africa's government said it was, quote, ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged. Trump also cut all financial aid to South Africa, citing the alleged persecution of the Afrikaners as well as South Africa's genocide case against US ally Israel at the Hague. Rubio snubbed South Africa last month too, by failing to attend the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting. South Africa is the current G20 president but Rubio said he was skipping the event because the summit had DEI and climate change on the agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also opted out of the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Cape Town after the US objected to the themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability. South African-born Trump adviser Elon Musk has also attacked South Africa for what he says are its racist ownership laws, that prevent him from taking his Starlink satellite service to the country unless he meets affirmative action requirements. Ambassador Rasool was South Africa's envoy to the US once before, from 2010 to 2015. When he was a child, Rasool's family was forcibly removed from their home during apartheid when the government declared their suburb a whites only area. He went on to become active in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. In his speech on the webinar that caused Rubio's outrage on Friday, the ambassador said South Africa needed to be cautious and diplomatic in dealing with Trump's administration.

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)s aren't optional anymore. If we really want the applications we're running in containers to be secure, we must know what's what within them. To make that easier, Codenotary, a leading software supply chain security company, is launching its new SBOM Operator for Kubernetes in both its open-source Community Attestation Service and its flagship service, Codenotary's Trustcenter. An SBOM (pronounced S-Bomb) is a record containing the details and supply chain relationships of the components used in building software. Since most programs today are made by assembling existing open-source and commercial software components, it's essential to know the name and specific versions of all these elements. For instance, a program using Apache Log4j2 versions 2.17.0 is vulnerable to Log4Shell attacks. One using Log4j2 2.17.1 or newer is as safe as houses. Now, you could check for that and thousands of other potential vulnerabilities by hand, or you could turn to a service like Codenotary's new offering. I know which one I'd pick. The SBOM Operator for Kubernetes mitigates the risk of software supply chain attacks by tracking all software and software dependencies running in Kubernetes. It does this by generating SBOMs of your running container images and maintaining up-to-date records of all builds, and dependencies. SBOM Operator builds its SBOMs using its own SBOM generator. When a new vulnerability shows up -- and trust me, one will -- this lets you know that it's time to make a fix when dangerous or vulnerable artifacts are detected. To make this keep working properly, Codenotary continuously updates its SBOM records, This data is kept in its open-source speedy, immutable database, Immudb. This is a zero-trust tamper-proof, auditable database. The container image files are kept in a Git repository. Codenotary claims this information is instantly available for search. With it, you can locate the software artifacts in your code in seconds. The program also keeps a history of verified image content changes. By itself, the SBOM is not very useful without continuously being updated and maintained as the information is deprecated with every new deployment or update, said Dennis Zimmer, Codenotary's co-founder and CTO. Now, users know exactly what is running in containers, with the most recent information, so they have the ability to immediately remediate something if necessary. SBOM Operator's chief programmer, Christian Kotzbauer, said, I am pleased to contribute to the wider adoption and use of SBOMs with the Codenotary integration in my Kubernetes operator, especially the additional security, timestamp, and search capabilities across the infrastructure were key to developing the extension. This is another step forward in Codenotary's efforts to provide comprehensive tools for cataloging and securing the software development lifecycle. Its programs and services, both free and paid, deserve Kubernetes developers' attention.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/codenotary-introduces-software-bill-of-materials-service-for-kubernetes/
Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) issued a sharp rebuke of President Donald Trump after the president said he would block Maryland from hosting the FBI's headquarters. Greenbelt, Maryland, was selected as the site for the new FBI headquarters in November 2023 under the Biden administration, a move Maryland leaders praised at the time. The Maryland site for the FBI's new HQ is build ready, and best meets the needs of the FBI, Moore posted on X on Saturday. That's why we won 4 out of the 5 selection criteria. Turning this into a partisan issue makes our country less safe and harms the FBI's mission of protecting Americans at home and abroad. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), who was Prince George's County Executive when Greenbelt was selected to host the FBI's new headquarters, praised the move as another way to bring jobs to the county at the time. This is yet another way for us to bring additional jobs to the county that will of course increase the tax revenues that the county is able to realize, Alsobrooks said. We expect that other businesses and consultants will also locate their businesses in the vicinity of the FBI headquarters. Greenbelt is already the site of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, which employs thousands of people. Trump put a damper on Maryland's optimism about hosting the headquarters when he said he wants to keep it in Washington, D.C. They were going to build an FBI headquarters three hours away in Maryland, a liberal state, Trump said, adding that the state's political leanings had no bearing on his decision. But we're going to stop it. We're not going to let that happen. We're going to build another big FBI building right where it is. Greenbelt is less than 15 miles away from the existing headquarters, a much shorter drive than the three hours Trump suggested. Featured Local Savings The Trump administration is likely to face challenges if it does decide to block the headquarters from being built in Greenbelt after the Biden administration selected the town as the site for the building. Maryland's entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), released a statement on Friday blasting the move. The FBI needs a new headquarters that meets its mission, they said. The GSA selected Greenbelt for the new, consolidated FBI headquarters based on the fact that it is the best site and it offers the lowest price and the best value to the taxpayers. What's more, it ensures that the FBI can move to a facility that will finally meet its mission and security needs as soon as possible. We will continue working to bring the headquarters to Maryland, following the final decision that was made to do so in 2023. Springfield, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., were also considered as sites for a new FBI headquarters during the selection process. Trump's recent position is in line with his previous comments on the new FBI headquarters. The new FBI building should be built in Washington, D.C, not Maryland, and be the centerpiece of my plan to totally renovate and rebuild our capital city into the most beautiful and safest anywhere in the world, Trump posted in all-caps last May.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/news/wex/moore-criticizes-trump-s-backtracking-on-fbi-headquarters-in-maryland-build-ready/article_1f664e1b-1491-5029-b911-8c259a799d2c.html

The restaurant has been serving some of Georgia's best soul food for more than 80 years and won't even let the weather hold them back. A portion of the roof collapsed in March 2024 as heavy rains moved through metro Atlanta and caused some significant damage. They reopened part of the restaurant a few months later, but it wasn't until a few months ago that the restaurant was fully reopened back to its original glory.

Types of Ink Cartridges A variety of types of ink cartridges are available to replace printer ink, each with its own pricing scale and benefits. The most common types of ink cartridges sold by online retailers include: OEM Ink Cartridges – Also known as branded ink, cartridges from the original equipment manufacturer (OEM ink cartridges) are usually the most expensive variety of replacement ink for printers, although some consumers prefer to stick with a trusted name over cheap ink cartridges. Remanufactured Cartridges – Some discount printer ink comes in remanufactured cartridges, which are used brand cartridges recycled to create new printer ink cartridges. Remanufactured ink cartridges are popular for their low cost, and businesses can feel pride in knowing they've purchased a more sustainable product. Compatible Generic Ink – Generic ink that is compatible with various printer brands is a popular choice for replacement printer ink. Not only are there a variety of cheap ink cartridges of this type, but a new compatible generic ink cartridge might sell for a fraction of the cost of a similar OEM cartridge. Printer Ink Refills – Many places that sell cheap printer ink also carry refilling kits so customers can refill their own existing printer cartridges. While refilling empty ink cartridges might be a more affordable option, it also requires a messy undertaking that many small business owners prefer to avoid. Environmental Impact and Recycling Programs An often-overlooked aspect of printer ink cartridges is their environmental impact. Used cartridges that are not properly disposed of can contribute significantly to landfill waste. To address this, many manufacturers and retailers offer recycling programs for their cartridges. Participating in these programs allows businesses to dispose of their used ink cartridges responsibly. Benefits of Recycling Programs Reducing Environmental Footprint: By recycling used cartridges, businesses can significantly reduce their environmental footprint. This not only helps in waste management but also aligns with the growing consumer preference for eco-friendly practices. Potential Cost Savings: Certain manufacturers provide incentives, such as discounts or credits for future purchases, when you return used cartridges for recycling. How to Participate Retailer Take-Back Programs: Many retailers accept used cartridges for recycling. Businesses can drop off their used cartridges at designated collection points. Manufacturer Mail-In Programs: Some manufacturers provide postage-paid envelopes or labels to mail back used cartridges. How to Choose the Best Printer Ink for Your Business Making a decision about purchasing new cartridges involves more than simply clicking buy. How can you ensure that you make the most informed choice regarding the best printer ink for your business? Several primary factors need to be considered, all of which can impact your printing costs and quality in the long run: Printer Model The type of printer you use – its brand and specific series – are crucial in determining the price of ink. Every printer model has its own set of compatible cartridges which can vary significantly in cost. Thus, when businesses are investing in new printers, they should always include the cost of compatible ink cartridges in their decision-making process. It's a key part of ensuring their printing needs are met within their budgetary constraints. READ MORE: Which Printer has the Cheapest Ink Compatibility and Quality Considerations When choosing printer ink, compatibility, and quality are as crucial as price. Using the wrong type of cartridge can lead to poor print quality and even damage your printer. Balancing Cost and Quality Printer Model Compatibility: Always check that the cartridges are compatible with your specific printer model. Quality of Prints: For businesses where print quality is vital, like design or photography, investing a bit more in higher-quality ink can be worthwhile. Shipping Options Different ink retailers have varied shipping policies. Some may offer free shipping for purchases above a certain value threshold, but it's not a universal practice. Therefore, it's crucial to take into account the shipping costs when making your purchases. Overlooking this can potentially wipe out any savings you might have made from purchasing cheaper ink cartridges. A comprehensive cost analysis will ensure you maintain those savings. Customer Support What are the ink seller's customer service commitments and product guarantees? These can greatly influence your buying decision. Many customers value the reassurance that comes with knowing the retailer will support their product in case it turns out to be faulty or ineffective. Furthermore, some customers prioritize choosing an ink retailer that offers excellent customer service. Having access to a team that will handle their concerns efficiently and professionally can be a significant advantage. Undoubtedly, the price is a major concern for customers looking for inexpensive printer ink cartridges. The challenge here is to balance cost with quality and longevity. Many online ink retailers make this easier by offering price comparison tools, allowing customers to ensure they are getting the most value for their money. Bulk Purchasing Benefits and Strategies Bulk purchasing of printer ink can offer substantial benefits for small businesses. Not only does it reduce the cost per cartridge, but it also minimizes the frequency of reordering, saving time and administrative resources. Strategies for Effective Bulk Purchasing Inventory Management: Keep a record of ink usage to predict when you'll need more. This helps in ordering the right quantity and avoiding overstocking. Proper Storage: Keep surplus cartridges in a cool, dry environment to avoid drying out or becoming unusable. The Impact of Printing Habits on Ink Usage The way a business uses its printer can significantly impact ink consumption. Adopting certain practices can help in conserving ink, reducing the need for frequent replacements. Tips for Conserving Ink Print Settings: Use draft or economy mode for internal documents to save ink. Optimized Document Layouts: Design documents to use less ink, such as by reducing unnecessary images and using efficient fonts. Regular Printer Maintenance: Keeping the printer in good condition can help in efficient ink usage. What is the cheapest type of ink for printers? While some printer brands are known to offer cheaper ink cartridges than others, companies should always conduct detailed research on the cost of ink for each specific model before finalizing a purchase. Printer brands like Canon, Hewlett-Packard, and Epson generally offer more affordable replacement ink cartridges. However, it's important to remember that generic compatible cartridges and remanufactured cartridges can often be even more cost-effective options. Where is the cheapest place to buy toner cartridges online? Toner cartridges for laser printers can be considerably more expensive than other types of printer ink. Fortunately, there are numerous online retailers that sell discounted laser toners. Small businesses might want to check out the toner cartridge deals from companies like 123InkJets and InkGrabber for affordable options for their laser printers. Is black ink cheaper than color? In most instances, black ink cartridges for printers are less costly than color cartridges. Additionally, they typically contain more ink than a comparable color printing cartridge. This means that not only are black cartridges cheaper to replace, but they also last longer, making them a more economical choice for businesses managing their printing expenditures.|2025-03-16|https://smallbiztrends.com/cheapest-place-to-buy-printer-ink-online/

Some schools have already started rescinding admissions offers amid Trump's hold on research money and purge of diversity programs. But in the days since his Friday blitz against Columbia, Harvard University instituted a hiring freeze and Johns Hopkins University plans to cut 2,000 jobs — reactions that have stunned faculty across the country and angered anti-war activists. In what Trump officials say is an effort to crack down on antisemitism, the Education Department this week launched similar investigations into 60 additional schools, a move that could spark a new round of tensions on campuses. Trump's unprecedented decision to yank $400 million from Columbia and detain protest leader Mahmoud Khalil has fundamentally changed universities' outlook and livelihoods. The president's moves show how financially and politically exposed many of the nation's most sought-after schools are — raising questions about their dependence on Washington, the next generation of scientists and the fundamentals of free speech and discrimination. I don't think they will be appeased by any changes in policy or pledges to do better, said Ted Mitchell, the former president of Occidental College who now leads the American Council on Education, said of the Trump administration. I think that in some way, shape or form, they need to see the institutions experiencing pain and for there to be some blood on the floor. … … The federal government's actions last Friday relate directly to Columbia's failure to protect Jewish students' civil rights, an obligation they undertook when agreeing to receive federal funding, Education Department spokesperson Julie Hartman said in a statement. Doing business with the federal government is a privilege, not a right. If educational entities want federal financial assistance, they must scrupulously adhere to all federal antidiscrimination law. The Trump administration's task force on combating antisemitism is conducting site visits to 10 schools under investigation for incidents since Hamas' October 2023 attack. Columbia is facing a loss of up to $5 billion in federal grants and contracts. Roughly $250 million of the federal dollars Columbia lost came from the National Institutes of Health, a major funder across higher education that sent more than $300 million apiece in fiscal 2024 to most of the schools getting Trump's early attention. All these universities are on notice, Leo Terrell, who heads the administration's task force from the Justice Department, told Fox News after the Columbia announcement…. … President Donald Trump's crackdown on alleged antisemitism on college campuses is alarming students and instructors who say the administration is trying to outlaw criticism of Israel's war in Gaza and bend universities to his will, the Washington Post reports. Trump says he's just getting started… What is clear is that Trump is willing to use the full power of the federal government, including its purse strings, to dramatically change behavior — by both students and administrators — on college campuses. Trump applauded the detention of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil and called it 'the first arrest of many to come.'

CHESTER — There's a danger to typecasting soccer players based on their country of origin, Jovan Lukic knows, even if the midfielder's game carries a very Serbian air, of technical skill but above all combativeness. Upon his arrival to MLS last month, Lukic wasn't sure quite what he'd find. At 23, he had played in Portugal after a brief, training-only dalliance with an Austrian club that immediately shipped him away. MLS would be different, Lukic expected, but how, he was unsure. The surprise has brought out his best. When I got here, I was actually surprised and impressed, Lukic said this week. I thought, in America, in MLS, the players were softer than in Serbia, because our special thing is to be fighters. Then I came here and I saw the intensity is insane, on the trainings, on the games, it's insane. Lukic has adapted immediately. A starter in each of the Union's first three games (all wins) to open the 2025 season, he looks a safe bet to hold that spot for the foreseeable future, starting with Sunday's visit from Nashville SC (2:30 p.m., Fox29). Lukic's highlight-reel goal in last Saturday's 2-0 win over New England fetched attention, but it's almost the least of what he's done this season. In Bradley Carnell's 4-2-2-2 system, Lukic has been vital as a stay-at-home No. 6, lending stability to a team that finished outside a playoff position last year chiefly because it allowed far too many goals. Three goals in three games is a step in the right direction, even if the shutout in Foxborough owed as much to New England's goalless start to the campaign and its loss of striker Leonardo Campagna in the first 10 minutes to injury. Lukic has brought what the Union patently failed to add last year after Jose Martinez's departure for Brazil: A dynamic, two-way, defensively responsible midfield presence. Instead of shuttlers like Jack McGlynn and Leon Flach last year, two talented young players with clear holes in their games, Lukic is doing a more balanced job in a system that accentuates his defensive strengths, with the offensive contributions a bonus. Even before the goal pinged in off the far post, Lukic helped the Union exert control over a poor Revolution. His ability to win tackles and play sound positional defense is evident. But of increasing importance and upside is his ability to play balls forward in the Union's quick-strike offense, yielding 10 goals in three matches. He has a penchant for a particularly ironic class of service. The first goal the Union scored in Orlando was set up by a weighted ball that Lukic played through the right channel onto the foot of right back Frankie Westfield near the end line, cutting out three defenders. In New England, he played a similar ball to the underlapping run of Alejandro Bedoya, which pushed back the defense, creating a half-space for Indiana Vassilev to collect in the box and find Lukic for his strike. That's long been a specialty of Lukic's, played through the space on either side of a singular defensive midfielder and designed to scramble the lines. It's the space he patrols defensively, as a twin No. 6 with Danley Jean Jacques Every time I can do that, every time I have the situation, that's the best ball you can put, Lukic said. When you drop the lines back, also in the middle, between forward and midfield, between me and the defense, those balls between the lines are always the best, so it's a big opportunity to score a goal. So I try whenever I have a situation to do it. Lukic's game is emblematic of the soccer culture he was raised in. Though not the biggest country among European powers, Serbia has qualified for three of the last four World Cups. Its exports to bigger leagues have tended to be tough midfielders and defenders – Nemanja Vidic, Branislav Ivanovic, Aleksandar Kolarov. The most prominent midfielder in recent years is former Chelsea and Manchester United stopper Nemanja Matic, and while Lukic said Matic is one player he looked up to, the similarities between the games of the 6-4 Matic and the 5-11, 140-pound Lukic are slight. Another Lukic – Sasa Lukic (no relation), who plays in the English Premier League for Fulham – is a more relatable comp. We just want to play football, give the best and want to win, Lukic said. That's our like mentality. We hate to lose. Goals are not normally a part of that. Saturday was his fifth career league goal and ninth as a professional. He rates his best goal as being one against RFCU Luxembourg in the UEFA Conference League qualifiers while with FC Cukaricki in 2022. But he's grateful to Carnell for giving him license to get forward. He has nine shot attempts in three matches, after five in a half-season in Serbia in the fall. It's a sign of what may be to come. And it's part of why Lukic, recalling the New England goal, evinces equal parts surprise at his recent attacking turn and joy at what might come. I would choose this (goal) one as my favorite, he said.|2025-03-16|https://www.delcotimes.com/2025/03/15/unions-jovan-lukic-pleasantly-surprised-to-see-mls-is-built-for-fighters/

A cavalcade of cars passed the demonstrators, honking, waving and pumping fists in support as the activists waved their signs overhead. In a few instances during the nearly two-hour event, a raised middle finger or a Go Elon, came from a driver. Popular chants included, Hey, hey, ho, ho! Elon Musk has got to go!

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/

Season 23 of American Idol is in full swing as Carrie Underwood returns to the show 20 years after her career-launching win. This time, the Jesus, Take the Wheel singer, 41, is on the other side of the podium, taking Katy Perry's place alongside longtime judges Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie. As Hollywood Week swiftly approaches, the trio is tasked with deciding who stays and who goes. Is Brajawn Upshaw headed home or to Hollywood? Watch his audition and you decide. Videos by American Songwriter Georgia Postal Worker Wows 'American Idol' Judges Originally hailing from Cleveland, Ohio, Brajawn Upshaw caught the singing bug in a third-grade music class. I kind of fell in love with the beautiful sounds, he told a local media outlet. For me, it's a safe place that can never go away. I've been performing music ever since. While Upshaw has honed his skills as part of an acapella group and choir, he never planned on trying out for American Idol. My mom ended up signing me up without me knowing, said the 22-year-old. With the full support of his mom, Tasha, the Georgia overnight post office worker dusted off the nervousness at the door. His audition video shows him confidently striding onstage to stand before the Idol judges. I'm going to cheer you on, all the way here, like I've been doing, Tasha says in her son's audition video. In the clip, Upshaw delivers a melodious rendition of Lovely by Billie Eilish and Khalid. The judges exchange knowing glances as he hits every note. Tune in to ABC Sunday, March 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern to see if Upshaw secured the highly-coveted golden ticket to Hollywood. Coming out with a golden ticket is showing my mom that she was right, he said. How Luke Bryan Inspired This Audition Before his performance, Brajawn Upshaw took some time to express his gratitude for American Idol judge Luke Bryan. I woke up one day to your documentary, and your dad was telling you to go out, live the dream, and if something doesn't work out, come back home, Upshaw said. I woke up, I was crying, I was thinking to God, 'I'm trying, but maybe I'm not trying hard enough.' The country star chronicled his journey from small-town Georgia to big-time Nashville in the 2021 docuseries Luke Bryan: My Dirt Road Diary. That's what life is about, taking the big swings, Bryan, 48, told the aspiring artist.|2025-03-16|https://americansongwriter.com/will-this-lovely-american-idol-audition-earn-brajawn-upshaw-a-golden-ticket/

Darrell Wayne Lester, the son of Burton Lee and Madeline Nadine (Romer) Lester was born December 8, 1960, at Skiff Medical Center in Newton, Iowa. Darrell remained a life-long resident of Newton. Darrell worked after school at Perkins and in the Holiday Inn Kitchen in the 1970′s. As a young man, Darrell loved Dirt Track Racing and Figure 8 tracks. All through the 1980′s he was a welder, a foreman, a warehouse worker and a truck driver for Magnum Muffler and Walker Muffler. Through the 1990′s Darrell drove a tow truck and rollback for Interstate Conoco and Auto Repair. He continued working as an Auto Technician at Magnum Automotive through the 1990′s and into the late 2000′s. On February 17, 2011, in Newton, Iowa, Darrell was united in marriage to the love of his life, Jeannie Dale (Colyn) Lester. Together they ran the family farm until they both retired in 2014. They had a love for cats and boarded several in their home and outside their home. Darrell's true passions were guns, shooting, welding and fabricating, building trailers, tow trucks and making tools. Why buy a tool when you can make it? He enjoyed scraping iron and taking old tractors of all colors to fix and repaint. Darrell was brokenhearted when his wife, soulmate and best friend Jeannie Dale Lester died on March 24, 2024. Darrell died peacefully at his home on March 13, 2025. Today they are together again. Per Darrell's wishes, no public service will be held. Interment for Darrell will be held at Newton Union Cemetery at a later date.|2025-03-16|https://www.newtondailynews.com/obituaries/2025/03/15/darrell-wayne-lester/
Invincible Season 3 has come to an end, so now is the perfect time to jump into the original comics to see what's coming next in Season 4. One of the coolest aspects of Invincible's first three seasons thus far is that the animated series is indeed taking elements from Robert Kirkman, Cory Walker, and Ryan Ottley's original Invincible comics run and bringing them to screen. With Kirkman himself helping to bring the animated series to life, Invincible has been able to adapt its biggest arcs while allowing for a much different kind of flow better fit for a weekly release series. Videos by ComicBook.com But one of the other benefits of Invincible's adaptation is the fact that it's following pretty much the same narrative path with what has been brought to life thus far. While some elements have been removed from the animated series, and new material has been added to flesh some other things out, you can still pretty much pinpoint an exact place in the comics where you will be able to jump in if you want to see what's coming in Season 4. Those details are below, but there are some spoilers for the Season 3 finale (and a little beyond) so beware. Prime Video Where to Read Invincible Comics After Season 3 If you want to jump into the original Invincible comics after Season 3, the best place to start is with Issue #66. You can either seek out the original numbered issues, find it within Volume 13 (subtitled Growing Pains ) or in Invincible Compendium Two. This takes place right after the Season 3 finale reveals some key teases for the future such as Angstrom Levy being repaired once more, a new alien invasion is getting ready to reveal itself, and Mark is going to be more determined to outright kill any potential threats to his family from this point on. Issue 66 also picks up with a major tease from earlier on in the season that saw Nolan reveal to Allen that the Viltrumite Empire now only has less than 50 pure blooded Viltrumites remaining in the universe. Due to the Scourge Virus (and due to the fact that many of them outright killed one another to determine the true strongest), their population has now dwindled to the point where, for the first real time, they can actually be defeated in the future. And this issue officially kicks it all off as they start a new journey working with one another to wrangle up Viltrumite weaknesses. RELATED: Invincible Creator Confirms That The Series Biggest Villain Has Been Cast When Does Invincible Season 4 Come Out? If the animated series is more your speed, then thankfully it won't likely be too much of a wait for the next season of the series. InvincibleSeason 4 was announced to be in the works even before the third season premiere, and early work on the new episodes has already begun. As for when it will release, series co-creator Robert Kirkman and the rest of the team revealed a desire to have these new season release on as annual of a schedule as they potentially can. I think that the release schedule that we're in is much more what we can expect going forward as opposed to the release schedule that we were in between Season 1 and 2, Kirkman explained about their current plans. We're working at a breakneck pace behind the scenes with Shaun O'Neill and Dan Duncan and the entire team to keep this factory moving and keep this show in production so that we can come out in a fairly regular clip. I can't guarantee that we'll be coming back in early February every single year, but I can say that is the goal.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/anime/news/season-3-invincible-season-4-comics-read/
Google has expanded plans to limit data tracking on its Chrome browser by extending that coverage to apps running on Android devices. The Privacy Sandbox project aims to limit the amount of user data that advertisers can gather from browsing and app usage. But details are scant, and it's not happening just yet. Google will begin by allowing developers to review initial design proposals and share feedback. Over the year, Google plans to release developer previews, with a beta being available by the end of the year. And it's clear that Google is worried that by making changes too quickly, it could upend its app ecosystem. Currently over 90 percent of the apps on Google Play are free, writes Anthony Chavez, VP of Product Management, Android Security & Privacy at Google, providing access to valuable content and services to billions of users. Digital advertising plays a key role in making this possible. But in order to ensure a healthy app ecosystem — benefiting users, developers and businesses — the industry must continue to evolve how digital advertising works to improve user privacy. It seems that right out of the gate, Google is worried that making apps more private could scare off developers from making free apps (although where they might go is unclear). We know this initiative needs input from across the industry in order to succeed. We've already heard from many partners about their interest in working together to improve ads privacy on Android, and invite more organizations to participate. Google also took the opportunity to take a pop at Apple at its App Tracking Transparency feature: We realize that other platforms have taken a different approach to ads privacy, bluntly restricting existing technologies used by developers and advertisers. We believe that — without first providing a privacy-preserving alternative path — such approaches can be ineffective and lead to worse outcomes for user privacy and developer businesses. One of those businesses is Meta (Facebook), which estimates the changes that Apple made will cost it $10 billion this year alone. Problem is, Apple's path has been effective for the people that matter -- the users. And users, when given a choice as to whether they want apps to track them or not, have overwhelmingly chosen to retain their privacy. Apple also paved the way for greater transparency by forcing app developers to outline how data collected by apps would be used. It's clear that Google feels it needs to make some positive sounds with regards to privacy, but it's also clear that simply handing the reigns of control to users isn't what Google wants to do, and instead, the company wants to come up with a solution that's more within its control. What does this mean for users? It means that if you want privacy on a mobile device, the choice is clear -- you should be ditching Android and buying an iPhone.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-makes-a-weak-commitment-to-android-user-privacy/
The feature was dropped due to networking constraints None Posted by Jon Catalyst Grey • 2 hours, 31 minutes ago • Comments: 0 Marvel vs. Capcom 3 is well known for its zany and over the top gameplay, so you can imagine the chaos that would have ensued if the developers of the game were able to make it so that 6 players could play the game at one time online. If you played Marvel vs. Capcom 3 online, you'll understand all too well how bad the online netcode was at that time, as this was in an era before developers regularly implemented rollback networking. Having 6 players all online at one time in a single match, each controlling their own character, would have made for some spectacular moments, but it wasn't meant to be back in 2010. Fast forward a few years later, and Street Fighter X Tekken was able to implement a Scramble Mode into the game, where four players all played at one time on screen. Clearly if this was possible back in 2012, it's a feature that Capcom could potentially roll out in a new Marvel vs. Capcom game. 2XKO, the upcoming fighting game from Riot Games, also features a four player mode, with each competitor taking the controls for a single fighter. This will work with the core gameplay of 2XKO, as the point person will control the action until they tag in another character, at which point the other player will take over. While this isn't four players on screen at once, it's a standard feature in 2XKO for four people to be able to play the game together, with two competitors taking turns at one time. If the next Marvel vs. Capcom game is a 3v3 fighter, you could see a similar system working as part of the core gameplay, with teams being made up of three people facing off against another three competitors, with just two players on screen at one time. However, it might be fun to include a Scramble Mode where there are 6 people on screen at once. While this likely wouldn't be balanced in any sort of way, it might be a very fun mode to explore and see what's possible. It wouldn't be the first time the creators of the Capcom Versus series threw balance out the window and created a fun mode for players to enjoy for heavily outside the box gameplay.|2025-03-16|https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/mar/15/mvc3-6-players-one-time/
Obesity and stress could magnify the risk of one of the most aggressive types of cancer, a new study suggests. Researchers at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) found that stress-related neurotransmitters and obesity-related hormones activated CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein), which was shown to promote the growth of cancer cells in the pancreas. In the study, mice that ate a high-fat diet were more likely to develop precancerous lesions. When stress levels were also raised through social isolation, the lesions grew even more. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The stress-related cancer risk was more pronounced in female mice. Based on these findings, the researchers suggested exploring the use of existing medications to reduce the risk of obesity- and stress-related cancers. Since β-adrenergic receptors play a crucial role in stress-related cancer growth, commonly used beta-blockers, which are drugs prescribed for high blood pressure, could be repurposed to help mitigate these effects, a press release stated. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types in the U.S., with a five-year survival rate of just 13%. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement One of the biggest challenges with the disease is that it's often detected at a late stage when the disease is already advanced, according to Dr. Robert Den, a radiation oncologist, professor of radiation oncology, and chief medical officer at Alpha Tau Medical in Israel. Unlike some other cancers, there are no effective early screening tools, so by the time a patient is diagnosed, treatment options are often limited, Den, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. The study reinforces the strong connection between the mind and body as it related to cancer development, Den said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Stress and its associated pathways can exacerbate disease progression, and we know that obesity fuels certain cancers, potentially impacting a patient's response to treatment, he said. In this case, we're seeing evidence that stress and obesity may contribute to the worsening of pancreatic cancer, which has major implications for both prevention and treatment strategies. Maintaining a heart-healthy diet and eating in moderation are essential, Den noted — not just for cancer prevention but for overall health. Exercise is particularly crucial in addressing both obesity and stress, he said. Staying active is not only beneficial for physical health, but also an excellent way to reduce stress. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Mindfulness can also play a key role in reducing cancer risk, the doctor advised. Spending time outdoors can also improve both mental and physical well-being, so I always encourage patients to find ways to be active, connect with nature and prioritize their overall wellness, he said. Regarding pancreatic cancer treatment, Den noted that there have been some advancements in chemotherapy and surgical techniques, but there hasn't yet been a breakthrough. Most immunotherapies, which have been revolutionary in other cancers, have not shown the same promise in pancreatic cancer, he said. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The key challenge is finding ways to help patients who are not candidates for surgery, as surgery remains the best line of defense.

Results of the IDF investigation into the army's response on October 7 are harrowing and deeply unsettling, Kibbutz Nir Oz said in a Friday statement. Nir Oz has become a symbol of failure and abandonment on that dark day, October 7, the statement read. The kibbutz added that in addition to its painful findings, the report highlighted the heroism of the members of its emergency response team, who – outnumbered by hundreds – fought alone for nearly two hours, doing everything they could until they were either killed or taken hostage. In the absence of security forces, the entire community struggled and fought – there were those who took up arms to defend their homes, those who held their doors shut, those who sent messages and called for help, and those who simply fought for their lives, the kibbutz said. A BLOODSTAINED room in Kibbutz Nir Oz after the October 7 massacre carried out by Hamas: In the age of mass disinformation, the terrible truths of what occurred on October 7 must be repeatedly shared. (credit: RONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS) Full lesson learning process Eshkol Regional Council head Michal Uziyahu called the results of the probe difficult and unsettling, but not surprising. Now it has been stated officially – the army was not there to protect us. Nir Oz was left alone for long hours without a response. The members of the kibbutz fought with immense bravery for as long as they could, the statement read. Nir Oz and Uziyahu called for the military and the government to conduct a lesson-learning process, take responsibility, and implement changes in the defense system for Gaza border communities to prevent such an attack from happening again. The kibbutz thanked all those involved in compiling the report, led by Maj.-Gen. Eran Niv, and former IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. (res.) Herzi Halevi, former Southern Command Chief Maj.-Gen. (res.) Yaron Finkelman, former IDF spokesperson Brig.-Gen. Daniel Hagari, and the other senior officials and commanders who came to meet the kibbutz residents in person. It called this act a sign of true leadership. Nir Oz further stated that a military investigation alone is not sufficient. It also called for a comprehensive national inquiry, not only to examine the failures of that day but also the long-standing policies that led us to it. The kibbutz concluded that this was the time for the return of the hostages, the rebuilding of the community and the kibbutz, and pursuit of the full truth. We fought alone on that day, and we will continue to fight with all our strength until all our loved ones return – hoping this battle ends today. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Uziyahu stated, At this moment, I turn to my friends, the people of Nir Oz – you will never walk alone again. See all of us standing by your side. Keep paving the way. You have been and will remain a symbol of resilience.

Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is a truly exceptional game that I find myself constantly returning to, despite having beaten the campaign numerous times. However, as much as I enjoy the semi-frequent updates and new Operations, I need a new campaign that continues the adventures of Titus and his new band of Ultramarines. After all, the finale of Space Marine 2's exceptional campaign definitely leaves fans wanting for more. Fortunately for me, and for the thousands of other 40K fans out there, Saber Interactive confirmed Space Marine 3 is coming. It is finally official, perhaps to the surprise of no one, which means that we'll be getting more Tyranid slaughtering, gore-filled action, and I'm incredibly excited about that. However, as much as Space Marine 3 is an amazing idea, and I am genuinely keen to play it, I think that we should have gotten a different 40K game before we get to complete Titus' journey. Space Marine 3 Could Be The Final Game In The Series It Feels Like The End Of A Trilogy I think there is a good chance that Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3 will be the final game in this series. That's not to say that Space Marine 3 will be the last 40K game Saber Interactive makes, but rather it will cap off Titus' journey. Saber Interactive hasn't confirmed either way, but it doesn't really feel like Titus has several games in him. After all, Space Marine 2's biggest flaw is that it largely rehashes the narrative from the first game, something that was undoubtedly necessary due to the time between releases, but nevertheless dull for fans. There's a good chance that a singular point-of-view could get boring and feel limiting, especially considering how varied the 40K universe is. The official press release announcing that Space Marine 3 is in the works didn't mention Titus by name, but he's featured in the game's current only image, heavily implying that he'll star once more. Of course, he and his elite squad of Ultramarines can go on a number of missions together that could easily span multiple games, just like how Uriel Ventris got six novels. However, there's a good chance that a singular point-of-view could get boring and feel limiting, especially considering how varied the 40K universe is. There Should Be A Spin-Off Game Before Space Marine 3 It Could Explore Another Part Of The Universe An Imperial Fist Space Marine from Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 on the left and an Ultramarine on the right. / Custom Image by: Tom Wilson If Space Marine 3 is to be the last game in the series - or even if it isn't - I strongly feel that a spin-off title would be a far better next game rather than a direct sequel. I've spoken numerous times about how the next Saber Interactive 40K game should focus on a new faction or even a different Chapter within the Adeptus Astartes. This is largely because Saber Interactive is the only developer working on genuinely good 40K games, with even Fatshark's Darktide being rather disappointing. Space Marine 2 Ultramarines wearing fully customized armor. Related Space Marine 2 has already provided plenty of post-launch content, with even more planned in the upcoming year for both PvE and PvP gameplay to enjoy. With no one else stepping up, Saber has basically been left in charge of creating all the good 40K games, especially ones with a sprawling campaign. As a result, if I'm ever to get an Imperial Guard or Tau single-player narrative-driven campaign, then Saber Interactive needs to make it. There are so many factions that deserve the Space Marine treatment, and a spin-off would allow for that. It would give Saber an opportunity to explore a different part of the 40K universe, perhaps one that hasn't been as touched upon in video game form. A Spin-Off Game Could Introduce A New Faction Or Protagonist They Could Take Over From Titus Space Marine 2 Cadian with purple eyes looking forward while a planet explodes behind him. / Custom Image by Steven Garrard The benefit of setting up a new protagonist or faction in a spin-off game would be that Saber Interactive could use it after it has completed Titus' journey. Much like how Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales helped establish him as the series' new protagonist going into Spider-Man 3, Saber Interactive could set up a new Space Marine or even an Imperial Guardsman as the next character who takes over once Titus nobly sacrifices himself or rides off into the sunset on the back of his Assault Bike. Space Marine 3 promo and Tyranid Related Despite Space Marine 3's announcement being great news for fans of its predecessor, it caused concerns over Space Marine 2's active development. I don't doubt that Space Marine 3 will deliver on its bold promises and satisfy those invested in Titus' journey, but I do feel it could do with a longer break in between, with a spin-off title allowing players to explore a different part of the 40K universe as they wait for Saber to perfect Titus' potentially final entry. I'm extremely grateful that we're getting more 40K games, and I'll happily settle for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 3, but I do think that a spin-off or even DLC would greatly benefit the series in the long run.

A row of allotments has been cordoned off as searches continue in connection with a no body murder investigation. Officers from Norfolk Police moved to the North Lynn area of King's Lynn on Friday and there is a heavy police car presence in the lane near the allotments. The search is related to Maris Ile, 54, a Latvian national who was living in King's Lynn and worked in Ely, and was reported missing on 23 November 2024. The seasonal worker went to work but never arrived and Norfolk Police believe he has come to harm . Police have also investigated several addresses and vehicles in Norwich this week in connection to the disappearance. Det Supt Phill Gray said: Members of the public are likely to see some increased police activity in North Lynn over the coming days. I would like to reassure people that we are doing extensive searches and have a team of dedicated detectives working on this investigation to establish the facts around the circumstances of Maris' disappearance. I'd ask anyone who may have any information - no matter how insignificant they think that information might be - to let us know. Four men and a woman arrested on suspicion of murder at addresses in King's Lynn, Norwich and Peterborough have since been released on police bail.|2025-03-16|https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2025-03-15/allotments-sealed-off-as-detectives-investigate-no-body-murder-of-missing-man
After careful consideration, Race Officials from the on-water management team, the Ocean Racing Club of Victoria, have decided to err on the side of caution after strong winds and heavy seas were forecast for Sunday afternoon. It's a long race, with many crews from interstate or overseas who are not familiar with Port Phillip Heads and Bass Strait , said Race Officials. It's prudent for safety to delay the start. going on to say: It's a long endurance race, and although these yachts and crews are prepared for various weather conditions, we believe it prudent for safety to delay the start to avoid very challenging conditions in the first few hours of the race . A meeting was held at 6:00 pm last night and it was decided that while the winds were strong but manageable, the sea state at Port Phillip Heads and into Bass Strait was of significant concern. The waves will be standing up tall, with sharp tops creating a hazardous and potentially boat-breaking environment, one that we wish to avoid , said the Race Officials, It's a long race with so much investment into making it happen. Delaying the start will provide better conditions for all competing. The main start for the 2025 Melbourne Osaka Cup is now expected off Portsea Pier on Monday at 11.30 am.

US Vice President JD Vance warned that Europe risks civilisational suicide if it fails to tighten border controls, further stating that, If migrants come from other countries who are incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself. Too many countries are unable or unwilling to control their borders, said Vance during a Thursday interview on Fox News' The Ingraham Angle with host Laura Ingraham, highlighting the increasing challenges European nations face in managing migration. He further expressed concern about European authorities limiting citizens' freedom of expression, particularly when they protest against immigration-related issues stating that: Europe is threatened with civilisational suicide. They are either unable or unwilling to control their borders. What we're seeing now, their attempts to resist that, that's good, that's the right thing to do. But you also see them beginning to restrict the free speech of their own citizens, even as those citizens protest things like invasions across borders. [It was such protests] that led to the election of Donald Trump and a number of European leaders, Vance added. Europe is 'At Risk' of 'Engaging in Civilizational Suicide': A Dire Warning from JD Vance The Vice President also voiced serious concerns regarding Europe's immigration policies and increasing restrictions on citizens' rights, describing it as a critical issue for the continent's future. If you have a country like Germany and billions migrants come from other countries that are totally culturally incompatible with Germany, Germany will kill itself, he said, I hope that doesn't happen, as I love Germany and want it to thrive, he added. The situation Vance discusses originated in autumn 2015, when the EU experienced a substantial increase in refugees and unauthorised immigrants from North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. European Union Asylum Agency (EUAA) data shows that Germany received 25% of all EU asylum applications in the first half of 2024. Vance further reaffirmed the administration's commitment to enforcing Trump's immigration policies, emphasising its dedication to stricter border control measures. He reported significant achievements in border security, citing a reduction exceeding 95% in border crossings since Trump's January inauguration. With border matters largely addressed, the administration is now prioritising deportations, stating We're building that capacity up. Vance criticised former President Biden's administration for inadequate funding of detention facilities and weakening Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), creating operational challenges for Trump's team. He commended Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan for implementing voluntary departure initiatives. We're going to encourage a lot of people to self-deport. We don't have to knock on your door. Before that happens, why don't you get on a plane and go home yourself? Vance added.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/germany-will-kill-itself-europe-at-risk-of-engaging-in-civilisational-suicide-warns-jd-vance/articleshow/119058866.cms

Catalyst Posted by Jon Catalyst Grey • November 29, 2010 at 10:57 p.m. PST • Comments: 85 Famitsu: About 10 more fighters to be announced for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 AndriaSang.com translated an interview that Famitsu conducted with Marvel vs. Capcom 3 producer, Ryota Niitsuma. There's a number of interest bits here, but probably the most compelling was Famitsu believes that there are 10 more fighters that will be announced for the game. This didn't seem like a concrete statement, but more of a logical assumption on their part considering other remarks by Niitsuma. Anyway, here's a bulleted list of the most interesting things that were stated here, but you can hit this link to check out the article for yourself. • Famitsu believes that as of Nov. 30, 2010, there are ten more characters to be announced. Some of these may be DLC fighters, though. • Having 6 people playing online at one time — with one person controlling each character — was considered at one point, but dropped due to online networking constraints. • The team is having trouble with online play due to the 3 on 3 aspect of the game. • Niitsuma stressed that MvC3 did not come about because of the success of Street Fighter IV. MvC3 an SFIV started as separate projects. In fact, Capcom has been undergoing negotiations with Marvel for years. • Capcom included a lot of older MvC2 fighters to balance out the roster, as far as speed, power and gender, and other similar attributes went. • MvC3's development team is made up partially of old MvC2 staff members, some Tatsunoko vs. Capcom people, among others. • Converting 2D characters to 3D has proven especially challenging. A special note about Amaterasu being the most difficult to recreate in MvC3 was made here as well. • As previously stated, all of the playable characters have their own personal background music. • Niitsuma stated again that Monster Hunter characters would not be in this.|2025-03-16|https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2010/nov/29/famitsu-about-ten-more-fighters-be-announced-mvc3/
SEATTLE — Slick Watts, one of the most recognizable figures in the history of Seattle basketball, has died at the age of 73. Watts played six seasons in the NBA, including the first four and a half with the Seattle SuperSonics, who he signed with as a free agent out of Xavier University of Louisiana. Despite going undrafted in 1973, the 6-foot-1 Watts was immediately a key member of the Sonics who established himself as a premier defensive point guard and playmaker. He finished third in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting after averaging eight points, 5.7 assists and 1.9 steals per game in 62 games. In his third season, Watts started all 82 games for the Sonics and led the NBA with both 8.1 assists per game and 3.2 steals per game. He also averaged a career-high 13 points and 3.1 rebounds per game in that 1975-76 campaign. Watts was named to the NBA All-Defensive first team in 1976, the first Sonics player to do so, and the same year also was the second ever winner of the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award, which is given annually to an NBA player, coach or staff member who shows outstanding service and dedication to the community. We are saddened by the passing of Sonics icon Slick Watts. Slick was a champion for the Storm and a beloved member of the Seattle community. Our thoughts and condolences are with his family and loved ones at this time. 💚💛 pic.twitter.com/UbNW6cJjo9— Seattle Storm (@seattlestorm) March 15, 2025 Watts' arrival in the Emerald City coincided with the Sonics' first period of contention in the league. Under head coach Bill Russell, Seattle made its inaugural trip to the postseason in 1974-75 and reached the Western Conference semifinals both that season and the next. Watts was traded by Seattle to the New Orleans Jazz during the 1977-78 season, and he moved on to the Houston Rockets the next season, which was his last. Though the Rolling Fork, Miss., native's legal first name was Donald, he was known as Slick due to his bald head, which he adorned with signature headbands, a look that was ahead of its time in the 1970s. Watts called the Seattle area home for the rest of his life, becoming a physical education teacher and basketball coach after his playing career. He dealt with health problems in recent years, and suffered a strike in 2021 before his 70th birthday. Watts remained to be an integral part of the community in Seattle, and his name was even used as a song title by Seattle hip-hop duo Blue Scholars. The Watts family has long been a major part of the Seattle basketball community. His son Donald Watts was a star guard at Lake Washington High School and then in college for the UW Huskies (1995-99), his grandson Isaiah Watts is currently a guard for the WSU Cougars, and his granddaughter Jadyn Watts is a forward for the Western Washington Vikings. Slick Watts' death comes just two months after his former Seattle Sonics teammate Gus Williams died at the age of 71. ©2025 Cox Media Group|2025-03-16|https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/seattle-sonics-legend-slick-watts-dies-73/3CEDQGGR4JAI7A67M24ULQ4GFM/

WARRENSBURG, Mo. (KCTV) - A semi-truck driver from California was taken to an area hospital after his rig flipped along a Missouri Highway over the weekend. The Missouri State Highway Patrol indicates that just before 4:05 p.m. on Friday, March 14, emergency crews were called to the area of westbound Highway 50 and NW 175th Rd., west of Warrensburg, with reports of a single-vehicle collision. When first responders arrived, they said they found a 62-year-old man from Santee, California, had been driving a 2020 Kenworth semi-truck west on the highway when he lost control of it. State Troopers noted that ultimately, the semi truck flipped onto its side. High winds were not indicated to have been a factor. Emergency crews indicated that the driver was taken to Western Missouri Medical Center with suspected minor injuries. He was wearing his seatbelt at the time. Investigators said the 18-wheeler sustained moderate damage as a result.

Follow-up from the incident on 16th St NE in Winter Haven today. - DailyRidge.com Winter Haven Police responded to the 600 block of 16th St NE today at 10:47 a.m. in reference to a man who was walking in the middle of the street with what appeared to be a rifle. As officers arrived, they found 40 year-old George Nerio (DOB 10-30-79, LKA 3950 Ave Q NW, Winter Haven) in the middle of the roadway with the rifle. His erratic behavior included saluting people as they drove by, walking in a military-style march and handling the gun like it was part of a drill activity. As units arrived on scene, Neiro had the weapon on his shoulder with the barrel pointing in the direction of the officers. Immediately, they commanded Nerio to drop the rifle. He dropped the rifle and put his hands in the air. However, he refused to walk away from the weapon. Residents in the area were told to stay inside of their homes due to Nerio's unwillingness to obey commands to walk away from the weapon. Officers and detectives on scene continued to try to convince Nerio to walk away from the rifle, to no avail. K-9 Officer Collazo and his partner Miko set up directly across from where Nerio was standing and at 11:58 a.m., more than an hour after the original call came in, Miko was deployed and took Nerio to the ground. He was taken into custody without further incident and transported to Winter Haven Health for treatment from the dog bite. No weapons were fired and no officers were injured. The rifle that Nerio had is listed as stolen out of the Polk County Sheriff's Office jurisdiction. I am extremely proud of how our officers approached this scenario and ensured every measure was taken for the best outcome, which is getting this guy back behind bars and no officers or members of the public being injured, said Public Safety Director Charlie Bird. Nerio, who is a convicted felon, was charged with Possession of Firearm by Convicted Felon (F.S.S. 790.23(1)(A) F-2, Grand Theft of Firearm (F.S.S. 812.014 (2) F3, Possession of Methamphetamine (F.S.S. 893.13 (6A), Possession of Drug Paraphernalia (F.S.S. 893.147 (1) M1 and Resisting Arrest W/O Violence (F.S.S. 843.02) M1. After treatment at the hospital, he was booked into the Polk County Jail. Please note the mugshot attached is from an April 10, 2020 arrest.

President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday put journalists at Voice of America and other US-funded broadcasters on leave, abruptly freezing decades-old outlets long seen as critical to countering Russian and Chinese information offensives. Hundreds of staff at VOA, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe and other outlets received a weekend email saying they will be barred from their offices and should surrender press passes and office-issued equipment. Trump, who has already eviscerated the US global aid agency and the Education Department, on Friday issued an executive order listing the US Agency for Global Media as among elements of the federal bureaucracy that the president has determined are unnecessary. Kari Lake, a firebrand Trump supporter and former Arizona news anchor put in charge of the media agency after she lost a US Senate bid, said in an email to the outlets that federal grant money no longer effectuates agency priorities. White House press official Harrison Fields took a more casual tone, simply writing goodbye on X in 20 languages, a jab at the outlets' multilingual coverage. VOA director Michael Abramowitz said he was among 1,300 staffers placed on leave Saturday. VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard. But today's action will leave Voice of America unable to carry out its vital mission, he said on Facebook. Voice of America has been a priceless asset for the United States, playing an essential role in the fight against communism, fascism, and oppression, and in the fight for freedom and democracy around the world, he said, noting that its coverage -- in 48 languages -- reaches 360 million people each week. The head of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which started broadcasting into the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, called the cancellation of funding a massive gift to America's enemies. The Iranian ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years, its president, Stephen Capus, said in a statement. - 'Negates 80 years' of US efforts - Advocacy group Reporters Without Borders condemned the decision, saying it threatens press freedom worldwide and negates 80 years of American history in supporting the free flow of information. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and senior Democratic congresswoman Lois Frankel said in a joint statement that Trump's move would cause lasting damage to US efforts to counter propaganda around the world. US-funded media have reoriented themselves since the end of the Cold War, dropping much of the programming geared toward newly democratic Central and Eastern European countries and focusing on Russia and China. Chinese state-funded media have expanded their reach sharply over the past decade, including by offering free services to outlets in the developing world that would otherwise pay for Western news agencies. Radio Free Asia, established in 1996, sees its mission as providing uncensored reporting into countries without free media including China, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam. The outlets have an editorial firewall, with a stated guarantee of independence despite government funding. The policy has angered some around Trump, who has long railed against media and suggested that government-funded outlets should promote his policies. The move to end US-funded media is likely to meet challenges, much like Trump's other sweeping cuts. Congress, not the president, has the constitutional power of the purse and Radio Free Asia in particular has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past. - 'Constant anxiety' - One VOA employee described constant anxiety, looking at your phone at all hours, and checking X in your time off to learn the fate of the outlet. The employee, who requested anonymity, described Saturday's message as another perfect example of the chaos and unprepared nature of the process, with VOA staffers presuming that scheduled programming is off but not told so directly. A Radio Free Asia employee said: It's not just about losing your income. We have staff and contractors who fear for their safety. We have reporters who work under the radar in authoritarian countries in Asia. We have staff in the US who fear deportation if their work visa is no longer valid. Wiping us out with the strike of a pen is just terrible. sct/acb|2025-03-16|https://www.youralaskalink.com/news/national/trump-freezes-us-funded-media-outlets-including-voice-of-america/article_2b9750c0-5612-5f77-983d-d5e24ed029a3.html

2019 ram 1500 mopar 730x446 at Car Accessories Aftermarket or Factory Fit? If you look around the options list for pretty much every single new car that comes out these days, you notice a bunch of parts and accessories that only a few years ago where the specialty of the aftermarket firms. The market for car accessories and value-added packages has grown so lucrative, car makers themselves are now taking over, putting a lot of the aftermarket guys out of work. For a consumer getting their parts and accessories from the original manufacturer sounds like a better deal. For one thing, these parts are designed and built by the same people who have made the car. So they work better with the car. There is also less hassle with fit and finish, seeing as these are installed at the factory or the authorized dealership. What's more, some time a manufacturer offers accessories as a sort of bonus, throwing in some nice free options to lure the customers in. And it's all well and good. But there is something to be said about choosing your car accessories from the catalog of a well-known aftermarket specialist. And guess what, many of the car makers know this too, which is why often they commission these firms to build the part for them. Take the new 2019 Toyota TRD Pro series. These cars come with really fancy suspension components that play a major part in giving any SUV serious offroad capabilities. And they have been designed and built by Fox and not Toyota. Likewise, when you want to order a sport exhaust system from BMW M GmbH, their top offers always come from Akrapovic. And what is the brand of the finest leather upholstery you see on as the most expensive item on the options list? Katzkin. 2019 Toyota TRD Pro Series 10 730x411 at Car Accessories Aftermarket or Factory Fit? The thing about the aftermarket specialists is that since they are focused on only a few specific parts, they often do a much better job, quality-wise and also creatively, than a design team who has a deadline for finishing a new hood scoop because they have to come up with some fog lights for the next model in pipeline. Aftermarket guys also have a better understanding of the latest trends and what people really want because they run a shop and deal with the customers first-hand. Factory designers are usually cooped up in a small office for months on end. But for us, the biggest argument in favor of going aftermarket for our car accessories needs rather than sticking with factory options has nothing to do with technicalities. We go aftermarket simply because those guys deserve the business more. Car makers are huge, greedy conglomerates with an insatiable thirst for money. Whereas aftermarket shops are often family businesses, or the result of a single guy's toil over many, many years. We'd rather help Joey Two Wrench down the block make this month's rent than contribute to Mopar's growing wealth!|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2018/02/car-accessories-aftermarket-or-factory-fit/
Nicolas Licari, MSN, FNP-BC HopeHealth Many men in the United States put off health screenings and don't take the time to find a health care provider. In a study of 1,000 men, 55% did not complete regular health screenings, and 63% dodged annual visits. Men often wait to find a provider until a condition has become severe, leaving them in pain, or ending in a trip to the emergency department. Culturally, health care issues are rarely discussed among men. Unlike women, who typically schedule an annual gynecological appointment, men have not been conditioned to make annual appointments with a provider. Some of the barriers to care reported by men include work schedules, not having the time to go, thinking they don't need to go, thinking nothing is wrong, not wanting to hear bad news, or avoiding insurance companies. Cost and transportation issues are often another major concern for underserved populations or those without medical insurance. Men may also think admitting something might be wrong is a sign of weakness, but dealing directly with medical issues is a sign of strength, and there is power in taking charge of your health. Men are at increased risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, depression, and cancer of the prostate and lungs. Seeking regular medical care can help men avoid certain conditions, prevent conditions from getting worse, and save money from costlier treatment down the road. Preventive treatment with annual health care appointments can help detect and treat early warning signs, helping you avoid expensive emergency department visits and contributing to more positive outcomes. Men who prioritize regular medical care also report better physical and mental quality of life as they age. Finding a health care provider you trust and can talk to about personal issues is important to feel comfortable with your medical care. It's estimated that over a quarter of men are anxious about starting the process of finding a provider, but there are strategies to help. Ask friends and family members for their input, and search online for reviews of health care providers. Call to make an appointment to start the process. If time is an issue, inquire about virtual visits. Take a family member or friend if you are nervous about going to an appointment alone. Write out any questions to discuss at the visit. All men between the ages of 18 and 35 need to see a provider regularly, even if they feel healthy. Men age 35 and above are recommended to see a provider each year for an annual visit. Each person has their own individual needs, and it's important to talk to your provider about how often to get a checkup and what screenings you might need based on personal risk factors. Checkups, or annual exams, establish a baseline with progress over time of personal health information and any medical issues that may arise with age. The exam includes personal and family history, a physical exam, routine lab work, recommended screenings for age or risk, and a review of any current symptoms. Typical screenings include blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, prostate or testicular exams, colon health, and sexually transmitted infections. Vaccines are also discussed, and lifestyle changes to help improve any medical issues may be reviewed. This is also an opportunity to discuss medical or wellness issues that concern you, including sexual health, sleep issues, or pain or soreness in the body. If a medication is prescribed, make sure to ask about potential side effects and let your provider know of any issues with medications within the first week or two. Stay compliant with prescribed medications and attend scheduled follow-up visits. Make sure to get in touch with your health care provider's office with any new symptoms, sickness, or medication issues as soon as possible. Your provider is a partner in helping you achieve and maintain optimal health. Men who regularly attend medical appointments, speak frankly with their provider, and aim to follow recommended guidelines can see vast improvements in health. Lifestyle changes such as eating better and moving more can help men achieve a healthier weight and improve blood pressure, blood sugar, depression symptoms, and mobility. Societal stereotypes may discourage men from seeking regular medical care, but now is the time to break the stigma and prioritize physical and mental health. Finding and developing a solid relationship with a health care provider can give men confidence and peace of mind about taking care of their health and help them lead long, productive lives. HopeHealth's Streater Community Center is now open near the HopeHealth Medical Plaza (301 N. Dargan Street in Florence). The center will offer programs to support wellness initiatives, including an emphasis on men's health. Carin R. Spears, Director of Community Health and Access, emphasizes, Men's health is a key priority at HopeHealth. We are committed to supporting men's physical and mental well-being through education, care coordination, advocacy, and outreach. Our programs, events, and resources are designed to help men take charge of their health. We encourage men of all ages to reach out and learn more.

Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.kwit.org/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation

Gary Wells was first on the radio when the local AM station did a remote broadcast for the grand opening of his dad's auto parts store in the mid 1970's. His shining moment on the air was reading the name of the winner of a drawing for an alternator or a hat or something. Gary drew the winning ticket and didn't know what it said. It turns out that Gary didn't know how to read at the time. Gary knows how to read pretty well now, and his lifelong passion for music brings him to KVMR every other Sunday morning to host the Crooked Highway. He started his radio career on KCPR, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo's station, where he hosted Burnt Dog Rodeo, despite the fact that he doesn't like rodeos or burnt dogs. It was basically an alternative country show, with a dose of bluegrass and classic country. He figured the end of college meant the end of radio, but he became addicted and started seeking out other stations. He began filling in now and again at the legendary (and now gone) K-OTTER in Cambria and San Luis Obispo. Gary later hosted the Evening Blues program on public radio KCBX in San Luis Obispo for about two years, followed by another couple of years at the helm of the Minstrel Song Show, playing his kind of folk music. As much as he hated leaving San Luis Obispo, his desire to live in the mountains led Gary to this part northern California in 2004, where he happily stumbled across KVMR.CONTACT THIS BROADCASTER|2025-03-16|https://www.kvmr.org/users/gary-wells/
(TNND) — The United States began to carry out a series of military airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday under the order of President Donald Trump. This comes as an effort to open international shipping lanes in the Red Sea that the Houthis have blocked off for months through attacks. The Biden administration conducted similar strikes but largely failed to fully stop the attacks. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump wrote on Truth Social. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. Trump also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. The Houthis reported a series of explosions Saturday evening. Images online show black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes an expansive military facility. The airstrikes come after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel stopped aid from coming into Gaza amid their with Hamas. They warned of additional consequences for Hamas if there was not an extension in the ceasefire as negotiations continue over the second phase. The Houthi rebels have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 until January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The Houthis, who face economic issues have since launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home. This comes as part of Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that has torn the Arab world's poorest nation apart. The Israeli military has not commented on the attacks. The Houthi media office said that the U.S. airstrikes hit a residential neighborhood, the Associated Press reports. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was solely a U.S. operation, according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike under Trump's second term in office. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.|2025-03-16|https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/trump-orders-military-action-in-yemen-amid-renewed-houthi-threats-to-international-vessels-gaza-israel-hamas-war-ceasefire-deal-red-sea-sanaa

ATLANTA — The parents of a 15-year-old girl have filed a lawsuit against Uber Technologies, Inc., Rasier LLC and an Uber driver, alleging the ride-sharing company's negligence allowed their daughter to be transported to an alleged predator without any safeguards to prevent the crime. The lawsuit alleges that Uber's lax policies and enforcement on identity verification put minors at risk and directly contributed to their daughter's abduction and subsequent victimization. In the early hours of Nov. 1, 2024, the teen was picked up by an Uber driver at a deserted gas station. The ride was ordered by Thomas Bonner, 23, who was later arrested and charged with multiple crimes, including human trafficking, aggravated child molestation and statutory rape. The Uber driver, allegedly without verifying the minor's age or identity, transported her about 30 miles to the man's home in Jonesboro, where she was held for four days until law enforcement found her. The lawsuit alleges how safety hazards inherent in Uber's operation — such as its choice not to require passenger identification, inadequate responses to reported concerns, insufficient driver monitoring, unfulfilled safety promises, and failure to mandate human trafficking awareness training for drivers enabled traffickers to use Uber to transport minors into dangerous situations. Uber knows its platform can be exploited by predators, yet it chooses not to implement basic safety measures like ID verification. Instead of addressing known risks of trafficking, Uber is backing laws like Georgia's Senate Bill 68 and House Bill 339 which seek protection from full legal accountability, said the plaintiff's counsel Michael L. Neff, of Neff Injury Law. Neff said that had Uber chosen to do business with proper safeguards, the teen could have been protected. This lawsuit seeks to hold Uber responsible, Neff said. The family hopes legislators will not pass laws that restrict survivors access to full justice. Instead, they ask that Georgia pass necessary safety reforms as ridehail riders should not be subjected to trafficking or sexual assault. The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages. A press release stated that the plaintiffs hope Uber will immediately implement stronger security measures — including mandatory identity verification for passengers, stricter enforcement of its age restrictions and comprehensive human trafficking training for drivers. No parent should ever have to experience what we have been through and are currently experiencing, said Shaun Glaze, stepfather of the teen. Our daughter could have died and now must live with the trauma of this incident. We hope a jury will hold Uber responsible to help ensure this doesn't continue to happen to other children.|2025-03-16|https://www.news-daily.com/news/lawsuit-alleges-uber-at-fault-after-teen-trafficked/article_455addc2-01e5-11f0-b7c5-13c58048ecf1.html
It was one of the largest cyber-espionage attacks of recent times: hackers compromised several United States government federal agencies as well as big tech companies, and were inside networks for months before anyone spotted them. These attackers were later revealed to be working for the Russian foreign intelligence service (SVR), and they started their attack in an unexpected way, by targeting a software company called SolarWinds. The hackers accessed builds of the company's Orion software, and then placed malware into software updates sent out to SolarWinds customers between March and June 2020. The software is used by thousands of organisations around the world. Applying security updates and patches is generally regarded as good cybersecurity practice to protect against software vulnerabilities being exploited to facilitate cyberattacks, so organisations around the world installed the Orion updates from a source they trusted. But it was that action itself that allowed the attackers in. It became clear early on the threat actor employed novel and sophisticated techniques indicative of a nation-state actor and consistent with the goal of cyber espionage via a supply chain attack. In addition, the operational security of the threat actor was so advanced, they not only attacked SolarWinds but were able to leverage the Sunburst malicious code and avoid detection in some of the most complex environments in the world, SolarWinds said in its investigation after the attack. SEE: A winning strategy for cybersecurity (ZDNet special report) Among those compromised by the supply chain attack were the US Treasury Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the US Department of State, as well as cybersecurity companies including Microsoft, FireEye and Mimecast. In total, somewhere around 100 companies were targeted by the attackers. Attackers had been active in the network for months before the attack was discovered in December 2020, when FireEye and Microsoft found intrusions into their networks. The attack on SolarWinds was disclosed just weeks before Sudhakar Ramakrishna was set to take up his new position as CEO of the company in January 2021. Due to the magnitude of the situation, he chose to get involved with the company's attempt to investigate and resolve the incident right away. It was a stressful time for all involved, he told ZDNet. When the business is in a state of turmoil and crisis, there isn't time to sit on the sidelines. The decision to jump in and start working with the team was simple. The first thing that had to be done was to examine what exactly had happened, how it had remained undetected for so long, and how to ensure it can never happen again. Part of that involved bringing in the services of Krebs Stamos Group – a cybersecurity consultancy set up by former US government cybersecurity chief Chris Krebs, and Stanford University professor and ex-Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was also involved in helping SolarWinds in the aftermath of the incident. But one policy Ramakrishna wanted to introduce from day one was the concept of 'Secure by Design' – building products with security more than anything else in mind. Many organisations and software developers say they take security seriously, but when there's deadlines to meet or products to repeatedly roll out updates for, software security can often get left on the sidelines. The notion of secure by design, I had it in my mind and in practice at some level well before I joined SolarWinds, Ramakrishna explains. Between the time I came to know about the breach and the time I joined, I started formulating my thoughts in terms of how do we organise around secure by design, what does that mean and what are the various elements of that? Then essentially went about business on day one in terms of implementing that as a process. Much of this secure by design philosophy applies directly to the software build system, with the process now designed around cybersecurity as the priority. One of the reasons that cyber attackers were able to conduct the supply chain attack was because of the static nature of the software-building process, where everything is done within one pipeline of development. While that's useful for developers, it also provides a handy target for the attackers. Now, SolarWinds uses a system of parallel builds, where the location keeps changing, even after the project has been completed and shipped. Much of this access is only provided on a need-to-know basis. That means if an attacker was ever able to breach the network, there's a smaller window to poison the code with a malicious build. What we're really trying to achieve from a security standpoint is to reduce the threat window, providing the least amount of time possible for a threat actor to inject malware into our code, said Ramakrishna. But changing the process of how code is developed, updated and shipped isn't going to help prevent cyberattacks alone, which is why SolarWinds is now investing heavily in many other areas of cybersecurity. These areas include the likes of user training and actively looking for potential vulnerabilities in networks. Part of this involved building up a red team, cybersecurity personnel who have the job of testing network defences and finding potential flaws or holes that could be abused by attackers – crucially before the attackers find them. Importantly, the rest of the company doesn't know what tactics and techniques are going to be used in tests against the network and staff – because cyber criminals and hackers don't declare exactly how they're going to conduct campaigns, either. They are paid to attack our internal systems, our behaviors and our internal practices. That improves the overall security consciousness of the company and that improves the overall security posture of the company, Ramakrishna explained. Analysis is performed to examine which techniques and vulnerabilities are successfully used to launch attacks – but crucially, nobody is made an example of. All of the information gathered from red teaming is put back into teaching everyone how to identify cyberattacks, phishing emails and other malicious activity to help drive good cybersecurity hygiene. But Ramakrishna and SolarWinds know that implementing new cybersecurity procedures isn't just a one-time initiative, it's something that needs to be repeatedly revisited as threats change, new vulnerabilities emerge, and offensive hacking techniques evolve. Increasingly, this will simply become part of the fabric of the company and we won't have to talk about it in explicit terms as much as just believing in it and working on it on a daily basis, he says, as SolarWinds works to ensure that something like the supply chain attack can't happen again by making the network more robust and taking a more proactive approach to detecting potential malicious activity. The company also hopes to take the lessons it has learned and help its worldwide customer base improve their cybersecurity. We are evolving and helping them digitally transform much faster into the future, said Ramakrishna. My hope also is that things like the build system that we have created will become more and more standards in the industry that others can leverage as well . By sharing what happened, SolarWinds hopes that other organisations can also learn lessons and improve their own cybersecurity strategies, because anyone can potentially be the victim of a cyberattack, particularly if those behind it have vast resources, such as the state-backed operation that breached SolarWinds. No one is immune, so you cannot think that it will not happen to you. It could happen to you, so just be vigilant about things and constantly learn, said Ramakrishna. Don't try to fight it alone or don't wish the problem goes away because the problem is not going to go away, he added. SolarWinds is implementing secure by design in its software build process and recommends that all organisations ensure they have cybersecurity frameworks in place to help manage security at every step of the way when conducting business, no matter what that may be. Most victims of cyberattacks don't speak out about them, and some will never publicly acknowledge they fell victim. But for Ramakrishna, the best way of showing other businesses what threats are out there and how to protect against them is to openly talk about what happened at SolarWinds – and he hopes that others can learn about what happened to help protect their own networks. I believe the best and maybe the only way to be most safe and secure is by information-sharing more transparently more quickly, he said. If you are creating a situation where there is a lot of victim-shaming that goes on, then people do not step forward to highlight what they are learning . For SolarWinds, there's also an element of maintaining trust. The company fell victim to one of the most infamous cyber incidents of recent times and Ramakrishna argued it was only right to be transparent with customers about what happened I truly believe you owe it to them: how can you earn that without being transparent? he says.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/solarwinds-heres-how-were-building-everything-around-this-new-cybersecurity-strategy/
Justin Allgaier held off Aric Almirola to win Saturday's The LiUNA!NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Las Vegas. Allgaier passed Almirola coming off of pit road during the final stops, and Almirola charged back from about two seconds behind inside of 20 laps to go to within a couple car lengths. But Allgaier's defensive driving forced Almirola to find a different line to run, which was less successful for the No. 19 Toyota in the final laps. Allgaier earned his first victory of the season, and he now has wins in nine straight Xfinity Series seasons.

Rabbinical Child Molesters AFP AUDIO INTERVIEW Podcast Play Button In December, the Brooklyn, New York District Attorney, with a long history of turning a blind eye to child sex predators in the close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, announced sweeping pedophilia charges against nearly 100 Orthodox Jews, men and women. A good start, for a community that requires anyone alleging sex abuse by a fellow observant Jew to first report to its rabbis, who decide whether the case should go to secular authorities. Trouble is, he didn't even release one name of those accused! Writer, attorney and child sex abuse advocate Michael Lesher, an Orthodox Jew, has been following these troubling scandals since serial child rapist and self-proclaimed rabbi Avrohom Mondrowitz fled to Israel in 1984, one step ahead of NYC detectives. As an Orthodox Jew, Lesher provides great insight into the community's practices and history in this 39-minute interview.|2025-03-16|https://americanfreepress.net/jewish-child-sex-predators-protected-by-brooklyn-da/

Summary A short fight followed by Theresia's past make up most of the episode. Emotional buildup wasn't entirely fulfilled due to extensive content cuts. Theresia's backstory and relationships were not fully explored in the episode. Title Re:Zero - Starting Life in Another World, Season 3, Episode 14 Theresia van Astrea Studio White Fox Air Date March 12, 2025 Warning: The following contains spoilers for Re:Zero, Season 3, Episode 14, Theresia van Astrea , now streaming on Crunchyroll. The previous episode of Re:Zero saw the defeat of one of the Witch Cult's reanimated warriors, Kurgan, the eight-armed swordsman. Here, in Re:Zero season 3, episode 14, Theresia van Astrea , it's time to finish off the other warrior, Wilhelm's wife, Theresia. Brief glimpses of their fight have been sprinkled throughout the season, but this is where it all ends. Unfortunately, the pacing in this episode felt somewhat off. Most of that is due to a ton of content being cut from the source material, the light novels. This was supposed to be the emotional highlight of the season, and while some emotional tones did hit, this episode doesn't really compare to what Re:Zero has shown in the past. The whole fight and backstory probably would have been much better off if it had been allowed two episodes, but it is what it is, and it could have been worse. Re:Zero Season 3 Sirius Romanée-Conti's Powers Explained Related Season 3 of Re:Zero introduces another Archbishop of the Witch's Cult, and her abilities are absolutely terrifying. Clashing Swords Wilhelm Faces the Love of His Life Surprisingly, the actual fight between Wilhelm and Theresia was relatively short. The fight also wasn't as flashy as Garfiel vs. Kurgan or the battle against Regulus. Wilhelm and Theresia clash swords for a little while; both seemingly at equal levels of skill. However, the balance tips when Heinkel, Wilhelm's son, calls out to him. This distracted Wilhelm for a split second, which was enough for Theresia to stab him in the leg, incapacitating him. Theresia then turned her attention to Heinkel, but just before she could murder her own son, Reinhard stepped in. Knowing what was about to happen, Wilhelm pleaded with Reinhard to let him fight Theresia. However, Reinhard knew that Wilhelm was no longer in any condition to fight; so, for the first time in the series, Reinhard drew his Dragon Sword and slew Theresia. This episode showed a very different side of Reinhard; a very cold and unsympathetic side. Reinhard was always shown to be the cheerful and respectful type, but this time, he killed his grandmother without hesitation or remorse. When Heinkel became enraged at him, blaming him for Theresia's death, Reinhard coldly told him that what he killed was just a reanimated corpse, not his grandmother, even though Theresia clearly came back to her senses moments before passing in Wilhelm's arms. Silly. You really never realized it? You've been saying it all this time. Your eyes, your voice, your bearing, your actions, all this time... 'I love you'. - Theresia's final words to Wilhelm The animation for the fight was good, but it only lasted about three minutes. So fans who were expecting something like the Garfiel vs. Kurgan fight might be left wanting a little more. Instead of a long, drawn-out fight, most of episode 14 is dedicated to showing viewers the previous Sword Saint's life. Re:Zero Julius, Garfiel Tinzel, Subaru Natsuki Related Plenty of characters in this popular isekai anime have met with split reactions from the viewer base. Theresia van Astrea's Past Theresia's Younger Years Episode 14 showed a young Theresia receiving the Divine Protection of the Sword Saint. She disliked being next in line because it meant that her brothers, who had worked so hard for the title, would have had all their efforts be in vain. She refused to take up arms even in her first campaign in the Demi-Human War. Unfortunately, this proved to be a fatal error, as her older brother led the campaign instead of her, which resulted in his death. One by one Theresia's brothers fell in battle; eventually, even her uncle, the previous Sword Saint, fell. Their deaths pushed Theresia to accept her role as the Sword Saint, destined to end the Demi-Human War. After Meeting Wilhelm Theresia, now a fully-fledged Sword Saint, met Wilhelm, a young aspiring swordsman. Their entire relationship was only lightly touched upon in this episode, but that's not too bad since their history was already suitably covered in season 1. Long story short, Wilhelm eventually found out Theresia was the Sword Saint and saw the burdens she was carrying. So, he trained hard to be able to beat her in combat to convince her to stop fighting and leave that role to him. Then, fast-forward several years, Theresia was sent to fight the White Whale, but the Divine Protection of the Sword Saint left her and passed on to Reinhard in the middle of battle, which led to her defeat. There was an interesting bit of her encountering Pandora shortly after, and it was implied that Pandora was the one who killed Theresia, but the reason behind why she was there is still unknown. Comparison to the Light Novels Swords Aren't the Only Things That Cut As mentioned above, tons of content was cut from the light novels. This isn't particularly unusual for Re:Zero, but this time, there was just too much cut, and it lowered the emotional weight this episode could have conveyed. This episode was supposed to tell the story of the Sword Saints and what it meant to become one. The light novels also discussed Theresia's past in far greater detail. Theresia didn't like Reid, the first Sword Saint, and she also didn't like that she was born with the Divine Protection of the Death God, an ability that caused any wounds she inflicted to become permanent and could even cause healed wounds to reopen just by standing near a person. Because of this, she hated fighting for fear of permanently hurting people, but receiving the Divine Protection of the Sword Saint meant she would have to become a warrior. In the anime, the only reason she disliked being the Sword Saint was because she didn't want to take the role from her brothers. The episode also emits the history of the Dragon Sword, the sword wielded by all the Sword Saints. By extension, the Sword God was also removed, a mysterious entity who watched over the Sword Saints, but was also the bane of Theresia's existence. Another important thing that was almost all but cut off from the anime is Heinkel's relationship with his wife. Heinkel is just seen as a monster who forced Theresia into fighting the White Whale and then blamed Reinhard for her death. Make no mistake, he is an unreconcilable, evil man, but there was at least some nuance to his shamelessness in the light novels. His wife fell to a mysterious illness, his mother died, and his son became the Sword Saint. All of this slowly drove him down a dark path and led to him becoming the worm he is now. title image bad anime fathers split image Dario Brando/Jojo Gambino/Berserk Related Family drama is known to raise the stakes in anime, and these father figures increase that tension by being truly terrible to their children.

college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-womens-college-basketball-p (AP) — Harmoni Turner scored 24 points and Harvard beat Columbia 74-71 on Saturday to win the Ivy League Tournament for the first time in school history. It's the Crimson's first trip to the NCAA Tournament since 2007. Fittingly the back-and-forth game came down to the final few plays. Harvard led by five with 17.6 seconds left before Columbia scored three of the next four to get within 74-71. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Crimson had a chance to seal it, but Elena Rodriguez missed a wide-open layup with 5.2 seconds left, giving Columbia once last opportunity. After a timeout, Riley Weiss took a 3-pointer from the wing that rimmed out just before the buzzer. She finished with 21 points to lead the Lions. Turner, who scored 44 points in the semifinal win over Princeton, earned the tournament MVP honors. She was the league's Player of the Year in the regular season. Harvard (24-4) reached the finals of the Ivy Tournament for the second time in three years. The Crimson lost to Princeton in 2023. Columbia (23-6), which won the outright regular season title for the first time in school history, lost in the title game for the third time in the past four years. Princeton beat them in 2022 and 2024. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Now the Lions will wait to see if they can get an at-large bid for the second consecutive year. Columbia made its first NCAA Tournament appearance last year as one of the last teams in the field of 68. The Lions lost to Virginia Tech in a play-in game. It was the second time in league history that the conference got an at-large bid. This season the league could potentially get two at-large bids with Princeton also in the mix. That would be a first for the conference. It was an entertaining first half that saw Harvard go up 34-26 behind Turner before the Lions closed to 44-42 at the break. The teams combined to hit eight of their final 10 shots, trading baskets for the final 3 minutes before the half. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

Davenport, Florida -Around 10:30 p.m. on Thursday, August 18, 2016, a silver 2007 Yamaha 660 sport motorcycle being driven by 23-year-old Brandon Gregorich of Kissimmee was heading eastbound on Ronald Reagan Parkway at Rosselli Blvd in Davenport when, for unknown reasons, the bike drifted south (to the right), striking the raised concrete curb. It traveled approximately 30 feet until it jumped the curb and traveled east along the sidewalk about 200 feet, then in the grass for another 50 feet. The motorcycle then struck a wooden utility pole and the driver was ejected. Both the bike and driver came to a final rest on the sidewalk. Gregorich was wearing a helmet. He was declared deceased at the scene. Evidence at the scene suggests he was traveling in excess of the posted 45 MPH speed limit. It does not appear at this time that any other vehicles were involved. The roadway in that area was closed for approximately 4 hours during the investigation. The investigation is ongoing.

Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.waer.org/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation

ATHENS, Greece (AP) — Greece's center-right government on Saturday welcomed a credit rating upgrade by Moody's, the last major ratings agency to lift junk status on government bonds that began 15 years ago during a severe debt crisis. (This) upgrade marks the closing of a great cycle for the Greek economy and certifies the country's return to European normality, Finance Minister Kostis Hatzidakis said, describing the action as a success not only of the government, but of all Greeks. Moody's announced the upgrade to Baa3 from Ba1 late Friday. It cited public finances that have improved more quickly than we had expected as a key factor in its decision. The agency highlighted the government's policy stance, institutional improvements and stable political environment, saying it expects Greece to continue to run substantial primary surpluses which will steadily decrease its high debt burden. Although ratings agencies began returning Greece to investment grade in late 2023, the good news was met with relief by a government that has been hammered for weeks by strikes and protests over its handing of a deadly rail disaster two years ago. Hatzidakis made the remarks hours before handing over the portfolio to Cabinet colleague Kyriakos Pierrakakis at a swearing-in ceremony later Saturday, a day after the government announced a reshuffle. Moody's upgrade of Greece to Baa3 marks the final step in restoring our investment grade by all major rating agencies, highlighting Greece's significant progress, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in an online post Saturday. We remain fully committed to reforms that attract investment, create jobs, and drive sustainable growth, he said. Greece spiraled into crisis in 2010 and received three international bailouts to avoid bankruptcy and repair its public finances through successive and grueling austerity programs imposed by European Union lenders and the International Monetary Fund. National debt as a percentage of gross domestic product peaked in 2020, rising above 200%, but has been steadily falling since and is expected to drop below 150% this year, according to Greek central bank projections. Moody's praised the government's ongoing debt reduction efforts. Over a number of years, the Greek public finances have outperformed our baseline expectations, which increases our confidence that Greek debt will remain on a firm downward path, it said. These improvements are due to both ongoing expenditure restraint and tax revenues that are rising quickly in light of ongoing institutional improvements in tax compliance and collection.|2025-03-16|https://finance.yahoo.com/news/greek-government-debt-upgraded-investment-080137249.html

Singer Keke Wyatt couldn't contain her emotions as she delivered a powerful tribute to the late soul legend Angie Stone during a packed memorial service at Word of Faith Cathedral in Austell, Georgia, on Friday, March 14. The star-studded homegoing service brought out celebrities like Tyler Perry, Kirk Franklin, Musiq Soulchild, and Anthony Hamilton, all gathered to celebrate Stone's extraordinary musical legacy following her tragic passing in a car accident this month. What touched fans most was Wyatt's heartfelt tribute, as she reflected on the deep bond she and Stone had developed since their days on R&B Divas: Atlanta — a relationship that transformed from on-screen tension to a spiritual sisterhood. Keke Wyatt shared a powerful tribute at the funeral for her dear friend, Angie Stone. (Photos by Paras Griffin/Getty Images for Netflix) Praise the Lord, everybody. Praise the Lord, everybody. Everybody God is worthy to be praised on today for this beautiful soul, Wyatt began, visibly emotional as she addressed the cathedral. I love Angie. She knows I do, that's my boo boo thing. Wyatt then revealed the truth behind their initial tension on the reality show, where producers had attempted to pit them against each other. It's so funny because when we were on 'R&B Divas' they really tried to get her to just get up under my skin, Wyatt explained. And I was like, OK, so she came up to me and she was like, 'Baby, look, they just had me come on here to ruffle your feathers,' she continued. I said, 'Well, honey, you did a good job.' And ever since that day, we have been the best of friends, and I thank God for her. Their relationship went beyond industry camaraderie. She would call me in the wee hours. And I would be up, the mother of 11 shared. And she would just pray with me and encourage me. She would come and bring stuff for my kids. Like she was so beautiful, like seriously I love her music and I love her voice and all that, but her as a person trumps all of that. Wyatt then delivered a soul-stirring, ten-minute performance of His Eye Is on the Sparrow, reducing both herself and many in attendance to tears. The Shade Room shared the performance online, where fans flooded the comments with emotional reactions. The kind of voice that would make you break down and cry!! one person noted. Another said, Whewwwww come on here Keke. Never have I everrrrr heard that song sanged like that!!!!!!! While Wyatt's powerhouse vocals earned high praise from viewers who marveled at the raw emotion in her delivery, others reflected on how far the two had come since their reality show. I never would've thought seeing them bicker on R&B Divas that Keke would be one day singing at her funeral. Beautifully done, one fan observed. Another said, Keke and Angie had a real, true GENUINE relationship… she was grieving and Angie loved Keke for everything she was. Even though brought to tears in the end (which was cut off) Keke was authentically herself and that's exactly what Angie would have wanted. Wyatt later posted the performance on her own social media, where the tributes continued. Singing our Angie to glory… this was real, we felt it and we thank u! one follower wrote. The tribute carried even deeper meaning considering Wyatt's previous revelations about her relationship with Stone. In an exclusive interview with Atlanta Black Star in 2023, Wyatt spoke about how their bond strengthened after both decided to leave R&B: Divas. I think that the day that we both decided to quit the show is when we like connected because I understood everything she was saying as she understood everything I was saying. And it just kind of went from there, Wyatt said. Even before the funeral, the Indianapolis native had been candid about reality TV's attempts to manufacture conflict between them. That was why I was afraid of reality TV, because they purposely put her there to aggravate the hell out of me, Wyatt explained. Instead of falling into the trap, the two women built an unshakable bond, calling their relationship the best of friends and sisters in Christ. Wyatt's performance was a beautiful tribute between friends and a reminder of her and Stone's lasting impact of their friendship.|2025-03-16|https://atlantablackstar.com/2025/03/15/keke-wyatt-breaks-down-during-angie-stone-tribute-over-fallout-on-rb-divas/

39_40_ss_hacking The mainstream media has been spreading the deception that Vladimir Putin ordered the hack of U.S. voter databases. The truth is, it could have been any hackers from anywhere around the world, including even ones hired by U.S. interests intent on sabotaging the upcoming election as well as smearing Russia, Donald Trump's campaign. By Ronald L. Ray The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Cyber Division, issued an FBI Flash on Aug. 18 in which it declared that the computer systems of two states' boards of election were infiltrated during July and August by an unknown actor. The alert was not for public or media dissemination but nevertheless was conveniently leaked to Yahoo News, causing a media frenzy. Immediately, The Washington Post and other mainstream media presstitutes blamed Russia, as happened previously with the hack of Democratic National Committee (DNC) computers. But is either claim true? And what is the real goal of the latest story, which turned out to be a tempest in a teapot ? Layout 1 This latest Russian scare story contains a number of significant inconsistencies. On the FBI side, it was alleged that in late June 2016 an unknown actor scanned a state's board of election website for vulnerabilities, while the majority of the data exfiltration occurred in mid-July. The FBI further stated there was a July 2016 compromise of a state's board of election website. Additionally, in August 2016 attempted intrusion activities into another state's board of election system were uncovered. Seven Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from two countries were employed in the first situation, while a single IP address was used against the second state. Nevertheless, the FBI seemingly alleged only a single perpetrator. Ellen Nakashima, writing in The Washington Post on Aug. 29 and relying on state spokesmen, presented significantly different facts, however. In that story, the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state. Yet apparently nothing was done, because the FBI's alert had stated the majority of the data exfiltration happened the following month. But, claimed the Post, It turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County. Moreover, state spokesman Matt Roberts said FBI investigators did not specify whether the hackers were criminals or employed by the Russian government. So the Post blatantly lied about Russian responsibility in its opening paragraph. And, despite the FBI's declining to name any perpetrator, the Post continued to blame Russia in the rest of the article. The Post continued: Illinois officials discovered an intrusion into their election system in July. Although the hackers did not alter any data, the intrusion marks the first successful compromise of a state voter registration database, federal officials said. Fewer than 200,000 voter records were stolen from Illinois's voter registration portal, according to The Chicago Tribune. The state informed the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also became involved. But the FBI alleged the intrusion occurred in August, not July. It supposedly told Illinois officials that it is looking at foreign government agencies and criminal hackers as potential culprits, according to the Post. Numerous media outlets have parroted The Washington Post's blame Russia first campaign, despite a lack of any evidence whatsoever. What is going on here? Cui bono? Who benefits from this nonsense? In fact, the FBI stated that it is nearly impossible to determine the actual country of residence of the culprits. According to a computer expert with whom AFP spoke, this is because it is easy to hide behind various networks, routers, and servers to make oneself untraceable. Additionally, the IP addresses listed by the FBI as ostensible points of origin for the computer hacks are in the Netherlands and Fremont, Calif. Based on the IP information, AFP's source stated that anyone who would claim that Russia is to blame is either lazy, stupid, or incompetent. We would add malicious to the list. Coincidentally, Fremont claims the largest population of Afghans in America, along with a large number of Asian Indians working in Silicon Valley. Amsterdam has been a center of operation for the Jewish mafia. But the DNC or the Hillary Clinton campaign also could easily have accomplished the job, so there is no lack of suspects. It is just that the Russia narrative suits the propaganda purposes of the Clintonistas and their drive for more war. As a commentator for RT (formerly Russia Today ) pointed out, if the Russian government did infiltrate the DNC computers—which is highly unlikely—they would have had no reason to hack into Arizona's and Illinois's voter information, as the DNC already has records on millions of voters. It appears to us that the board of election hacks were most likely petty criminality turned into dishonest presstitute propaganda on behalf of Queen Clinton and the Zionist warmongers who want world war with Russia, before Donald Trump has an opportunity to make friends with the great Slavic nation. Cui bono? The story also serves the purposes of homeland security thugs. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson recently announced the possibility of declaring the U.S. election system critical national infrastructure, which could lead to total federal control of the voting process and an end to even the remaining appearance of elected representation.|2025-03-16|https://americanfreepress.net/vote-hacking-is-russia-being-set-up/
By Nelson Renteria EL SALVADOR (Reuters) -The United States is set to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison 300 alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang that it deports to the Central American country, for one year, the Associated Press reported on Saturday, citing an internal memo. El Salvador confirms it will house these individuals for one (1) year, pending the United States' decision on their long term disposition, AP quoted a memo from El Salvador's Foreign Ministry as saying. El Salvador's presidential office told Reuters it only knows what has been made public, while the White House and Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signaled during a visit last month that the country's government had offered to host dangerous criminals deported from the United States in its prisons. Human rights groups have opposed the plan, citing reports of torture and deaths in custody in El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele has spearheaded an anti-gang crackdown that has included mass trials and construction of a mega prison. The move comes as the Trump administration pursues mass deportations of migrants, including agreements under which third countries accept citizens. Washington last month designated Tren de Aragua and other criminal groups across the region as global terrorist organizations, a move some analysts said could expose to prosecution migrants who pay human smugglers. Tren de Aragua has been blamed for a surge in crime in the Americas, and the U.S. has accused it of activities including human smuggling, gender-based violence, money laundering and drug trafficking. Separately on Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump invoked a little-known 18th-century wartime law to declare Tren de Aragua as alien enemies who are perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States. All Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies, he said in a proclamation.

I was very happy to see the article on Right Worshipful Brother Leonard Norris Dec. 5. He was master of our Masonic Lodge here in Vernon named Miriam Lodge #20 in 1896 and District Deputy Grand Master of the North Okanagan in 1905. There is also a plaque honouring him at the entrance to our courthouse. In those days the Catholic Church frowned on Freemasonry and Brother Norris and Brother Luc Girouard, the first postmaster in Vernon, were both Catholic; the local priest would not give them last rites unless they renounced Freemasonry. They would not do this because Freemasonry is not a religion but welcomes all good men of all faiths. As a result both men have been honoured in many ways around our city.

NEW YORK — The Trump administration's recent changes to student loans are causing frustration and confusion for some borrowers. In response to a February court ruling that blocked some Biden-era programs, the Education Department has taken down online and paper applications for income-driven repayment plans. This especially hurts anyone who's lost their jobs, including federal workers, said Natalia Abrams, founder and president of the Student Debt Crisis Center. A few months ago, they would have been able to get on a zero-dollar income-driven repayment plan. The removal of application materials also has caused confusion around the recertification process for borrowers already enrolled in repayment plans, experts say. Income-driven repayment plans take a borrower's finances and family size into account when calculating monthly payments, but borrowers must periodically demonstrate they still qualify. Adding to the uncertainty are layoffs at the Education Department, which oversees the federal loan system. The federal website for student loans and financial aid, StudentAid.gov, suffered an hours-long outage Wednesday, but the department has said it will continue to deliver on its commitments. It's been wave after wave of bad news for student borrowers, said Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at the Student Borrower Protection Center. Here's some guidance for those with student loans. Check with your loan servicer and know your options All borrowers currently enrolled in income-driven repayment plans should get a sense of when your recertification deadline is and get a sense of what options are available to you if the form is not available online to recertify your income, Bañez said. Recertification confirms a borrower's financial situation. With some forms not currently available, borrowers who are unable to complete that process could be in jeopardy. If borrowers are already on an income-driven repayment plan, they should still be allowed to remain on that repayment plan if they are able to recertify their income. Abrams said it's also a good idea to take screenshots of your account's current status on the student aid website. What other resources are available? State-specific and state-level resources are available for student borrowers. Congress members have teams charged with helping constituents if they are having trouble with a federal agency or struggling to contact a federal student loan servicer. Borrowers may contact their representatives in Congress and open a casework file by going onto their website or calling their office. Try saying something like, 'I need your help to understand how to get into an affordable repayment option, which I'm entitled to under the law,' Bañez said. 'Even though this federal department has taken down these applications, I need your help.' Despite the thinning of the Education Department and President Donald Trump's dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, loan servicers still must consider a borrower's financial situation, Bañez said. You can see if you can get temporary forbearance or a deferment of payments for financial hardship, she said. State attorneys general also take inquiries from student borrowers. What are affected borrowers saying? Jessica Fugate, a government relations manager for the city of Los Angeles, said she was a less than a year from student loan forgiveness under the Biden-era Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives outstanding loans after 120 payments. With an ongoing court challenge to her former SAVE payment plan, though, Fugate hoped to switch to an income-driven plan before Trump took office. She applied in January. It's the most affordable option to repay my loans while living in Los Angeles working for the government on a government salary, said Fugate, 42. And it would mean my payments counted towards forgiveness. As of February, Fugate notified that her application was received and she had been notified of its status, but they didn't say when she would know if she was approved. And when I called recently, the machine said there was a four hour wait, she said. With income-driven repayment plans in limbo, Fugate isn't sure what her options are and hopes to one day have her federal loans behind her. I've been working for government for almost 10 years. After that much time, you don't do it for the glory, she said. I've spent most of my career giving back to other people. I don't mind serving people. I just feel this was an agreement they made with the public, and so we're owed that. And it's a lot of us. And we're not just numbers. Debbie Breen, 56, works at an agency on healthy aging in Spokane, Washington. Breen said she has worked in the nonprofit sector for more than 10 years and that nearly all those years counted toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Breen also was on the Biden-era SAVE plan, which means she was placed in forbearance when the court challenge to that plan was upheld. Like Fugate, she had planned to switch to an income-driven repayment plan to have her payments count towards forgiveness. I was months away from ending this nightmare, she said. Now I don't think that's going to happen. I'm kind of in panic mode because I know that if they stop income-driven repayment plans, I don't know that I'm going to be able to afford the payments each month. Breen said she has two kids who also have student loans. They're dealing with the same thing, she said. It's scary. It's absolutely scary.|2025-03-16|https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-news/2025/03/some-student-loan-repayment-plans-have-been-suspended/

In 2004, then Singapore Airlines flight attendant Vanessa Khaw regularly entered the cockpit to hand the pilots their meals. Catching the astonishing sight of the sunrise from the flight deck inspired her dreams of becoming a pilot, to see those views every day. Now a pilot of 15 years with SIA's budget airline Scoot and Tigerair, which was merged with Scoot, Captain Khaw flies Airbus A320 and A321 narrow-body planes, and was appointed a flight instructor half a year ago, training pilots who join the airline. While she has already achieved the rank of a captain, she said: I'm still constantly improving and thinking about what's next - which is why I went on to apply to be a flight instructor. It's another challenge for me to take on, and I'm enjoying it. The 41-year-old is one of the 61 female pilots at SIA and Scoot who make up 1.9 per cent of SIA Group's 3,245 pilots, according to the group's latest Sustainability Report covering April 2023 to March 2024. This is marginally higher than the 1.6 per cent from April 2022 to March 2023, and 1.4 per cent from April 2021 to March 2022, and almost on a par with Jetstar Asia, where about 2 per cent of its 128 pilots are women. While more women here are becoming commercial pilots, their numbers lag behind other countries'. In India, 14.4 per cent of its pilots are women, according to national civil aviation statistics for the period from 2022 to 2023. At Australia's national carrier Qantas, women currently make up around 7.5 per cent of the pilots. On the slower growth of the number of female pilots in Singapore, Ms Mabel Kwan, vice-president of the Singapore chapter of Women in Aviation, said that many young women may be unaware of the viability of pursuing a career as a pilot, or do not know about the pathways they need to take to become a pilot. She added that some may have misconceptions of the dangers associated with flying and mistakenly believe that there is no work-life balance as a pilot. Collaborative efforts with airlines, training programmes and awareness initiatives that tell the stories of successful female pilots - especially to the younger generation - could turn this around, she said. Ms Kwan also noted that previously, aspiring pilots had to be accepted by an airline in order to be trained as a pilot. But now, they can learn to fly at training schools that provide local ground school preparation here and facilitate further training in countries such as Australia and the US. Female pilots were few and far between in 2010, and Capt Khaw recalls that her fellow pilots were surprised to see her in the flight deck in her early days. But she has observed more female pilots joining Scoot over the years, and they keep in touch over an all-women pilots' chat group. She said: Actually, I've stopped identifying myself as a 'female pilot'. I'm just a pilot, because actually, the expectations are the same. Whether you're male or whether you're female, you still have to meet the standards. While taking part-time lessons for a private pilot licence in Johor Bahru, she set her mind on becoming a pilot for the rest of her life. She quit her cabin crew job in 2007 after 3½ years, and trained for and obtained a commercial pilot licence at Singapore Flying College in 2009, funding most of the six-figure cost herself and getting loans from her family to cover the remaining sum.

PHOTO: COURTESY OF VANESSA KHAW Her family, worried that the male-dominated industry would not be suitable for her, did not support her decision, telling her that being a pilot was a job for men and that no one would want to marry you , she recalled. But she convinced them otherwise with her determination. She faced rejections from multiple airlines, but got her big break when she was accepted into Tigerair in 2010. Capt Khaw credits female role models - including Capt Vanessa Ess, the first woman to make it into SilkAir's cadet pilot programme in 2001 - who showed that it was actually possible for women to become pilots, inspiring her to keep going. On March 8, to commemorate International Women's Day, Capt Khaw operated a flight from Singapore to Chiang Mai where all the key personnel - from the duty terminal managers, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers and security personnel to the pilots and cabin crew - were women.

ST PHOTO: GIN TAY As she typically operates turnaround flights within the region, Capt Khaw can return home every day to spend time with her two daughters, aged seven and nine, who also want to be pilots. Her husband is also a Scoot pilot. Recounting meaningful flight encounters, she said some passengers were pleasantly surprised to see a female captain in command, and even asked to meet her after the flight to thank her for the safe flight and take photos with her. She hopes to advance to operating wide-body aircraft, such as the Boeing 787s, that can fly farther. As she typically operates turnaround flights within the region, Capt Khaw can return home every day to spend time with her two daughters. Another female pilot is Jetstar Asia senior first officer (SFO) Lim Wen Shan, 45, a former military pilot with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) who crossed over to the world of commercial flying in 2019. She now flies the Airbus A320 at Jetstar Asia. In the RSAF for 14 years, she flew the C-130 transport aircraft, which can carry soldiers, military equipment and other supplies. But the younger retirement age of 50 for air force pilots prompted her to make a natural career transition to becoming a commercial pilot, as she wanted to continue flying for longer. The retirement age for commercial pilots is 65.

SIA started accepting female cadet pilots in 2016. But SFO Lim noted that she has observed more female pilots in batches after hers in the RSAF, adding that more women may be encouraged to join the aviation sector since information on flying careers is now more accessible due to social media and public outreach campaigns. In December 2024, nearly 20 years after getting her wings, SFO Lim was able to take her mother on a flight she operated - to Wuxi, a city in eastern China. It was something she could never do as an RSAF pilot, SFO Lim mused, adding that she feels blessed to now be able to invite her mother aboard her flights and explore other cities with her. (My mother) was quite stunned and surprised at first when I invited her to the cockpit, and she even asked if she could come in to take a picture.|2025-03-16|https://www.tnp.sg/news/former-sia-air-stewardess-journey-becoming-pilot-and-instructor
The 18th series of the popular ITV talent show began late last month (February). Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli are back again as judges on the show, joined this season by internet personality, boxer and rapper KSI (guest judge). Ant and Dec have also returned as BGT hosts. How much is Ant and Dec's net worth? Why is Britain's Got Talent not on this weekend? BGT was removed from ITV's Saturday night schedule this weekend (March 15), replaced by the final match of the 2025 Guinness Six Nations tournament between France and Scotland. Kick off for the Six Nations clash was at 8pm and so ITV coverage was scheduled for 7.15pm to 10.35pm meaning there was no room for BGT which usually airs at 7pm. Coverage of the France v Scotland match also meant popular ITV quiz show The 1% Club, hosted by Lee Mack, was also bumped from the Saturday night schedule. 'Absolute joke': Fans fuming as BGT pulled from ITV schedule In the absence of BGT, fans took to social media instead on Saturday night to vent their frustration at the silly decision to pull the show from the weekend schedule. Britain's Got Talent may not be the telly this weekend, but we *promise* we'll make up for it next weekend! Tune in for more brand spanking new #BGT Auditions, Saturday 22nd March at 7pm on @ITV 1, @ITVX and @WeAreSTV. pic.twitter.com/47fyqU1bUz— BGT (@BGT) March 15, 2025 One fan, posting on X (formerly Twitter), said: Britain's got talent not on tonight so I am a little bit p****d about that. I need my Saturday Ant and Dec. Another viewer commented: Whoever made that decision wants the sack! So many more channels you could put the rugby on. Alienated a lot of your viewer on a Saturday night . Silly decision. While a third person added: Absolute joke this is. Best night of the week for tv and you take everything off for that s**t. Why not put the friggin rugby on itv4 like you did with the FA cup. RECOMMENDED READING: When is Britain's Got Talent back on TV?

With egg prices high, U.S. border officials report a sharp increase in smuggling attempts from Mexico and Canada. Customs and Border Protection has recorded a 158% rise in intercepted egg shipments at its San Diego field office since last year, The Wall Street Journal reported. At the El Paso border station in Texas, CBP identified more than 90 people attempting to import raw eggs from Mexico between January and February. Similarly, officials at the Detroit-Windsor crossing at the Canadian border reported a 36% increase in interceptions of eggs compared to the previous year. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

The ratings battle between the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing and ITV's The X Factor was one of the most ferocious in TV history. Now The X Factor's creator Simon Cowell is back to challenge Strictly – with a Netflix talent show that aims to steal its Saturday night popularity crown. The series, which starts this autumn, will follow the music mogul as he searches for singers to form a chart-topping boy band. Sources close to the show say it mirrors The X Factor's format by having auditions followed by a 'judge's houses' stage. Episodes to find the four or five who will form the band will be similar to The X Factor's live shows, which at their peak had 19 million viewers. This time, shows will be pre-recorded for the streaming giant. Producers believe 65-year-old Cowell's determination to prove the boy band format is relevant to today's music scene will make fascinating viewing and say the show is also likely to air in the US. The series, which starts this autumn, will follow the music mogul as he searches for singers to form a chart-topping boy band / Producers believe 65-year-old Cowell's determination to prove the boy band format is relevant to air in the US It comes 15 years after Cowell founded smash-hit boy band One Direction on The X Factor. A show insider said: 'You get a sense of how much Simon wants to succeed with his goal of topping the success of One Direction. 'It will be fascinating to see how he fares against Strictly when the BBC brings that back this year. 'Simon used to love the sport of taking on Strictly in the ratings war back in the day. It's about time Strictly had some competition.' Sources say Cowell, who is still a judge on Britain's Got Talent, is convinced he has assembled a group of boy singers with the talent to rival One Direction's success. Netflix chiefs are said to also believe the show offers 'much more' than just recycled scenarios of the old search-for-a-star format. The X Factor ran for 14 years before being axed in 2018. It boasted judges such as Cheryl Tweed, left, and produced stars like Leona Lewis, Will Young, Little Mix and Olly Murs. Cowell was devastated after One Direction's Liam Payne plunged to his death from a hotel balcony in Argentina last October and there were claims he was considering halting plans for his new project. Whether he will speak of his grief over Liam on the Netflix series is not known. The X Factor ran for 14 years before being axed in 2018.

Days after transcripts were released, Idaho news agencies obtained the recording of the 911 call made by the surviving roommates of the University of Idaho murders on November 13, 2022. Xana Kernodle, Ethan Chapin, Madison Mogen, and Kaylee Goncalves were found stabbed to death on that morning. The two surviving roommates called friends over after a disturbing night that included one of them reporting seeing a man in a ski mask in the house. They texted their roommates and received no response, and just before noon, they realized something was desperately wrong. Transcripts of the 911 calls as well as the text messages between the surviving roommates were released last week, as CrimeOnline reported, when previously sealed motions were unsealed by the court. On Friday, media outlets got the recordings themselves, which they'd long sought. The chaos and fear is palpable in the recording as the dispatcher tries to get information, while the roommates pass the phone around, sometimes to the frustration of the dispatcher. The call ends when Moscow Police officers arrive on the scene. Bryan Kohberger, a graduate student at nearby Washington State University, was ultimately arrested and charged with the crimes. He was taken into custody at his parents home in Pennsylvania, where he had gone for the Christmas holiday, and extradited to Idaho to stand trial. His attorneys have used the 911 call as one of their many attempts to have the indictment against their client tossed out, claiming that it should not have been played for the grand jury. The judge overseeing the case dismissed that motion. Kohberger's trial is set to begin in August.|2025-03-16|https://www.crimeonline.com/2025/03/15/hear-it-911-audio-released-from-university-of-idaho-murders/
Image: Getty/Shannon Fagan You're asked about the biggest cybersecurity threats faced by business – which ones spring to mind first? Maybe it's relentless ransomware attacks, with cyber criminals encrypting networks and demanding vast sums for a decryption key – even from hospitals. Or maybe it's a sneaky malware attack, which lets hackers hide inside the network for months on end, stealing everything from usernames and passwords to bank details. Both of these are on the list, for sure. These are awful attacks to experience and can cause terrible damage. But there's another much simpler form of cyber crime that makes scammers the most money by far – and doesn't get much attention. The scale of business email compromise (BEC) attacks is clear: according to the FBI, the combined total lost to BEC attacks is $43 billion and counting, with attacks reported in at least 177 countries. What makes BEC such a rich opportunity for scammers is there's rarely a need to be a highly skilled hacker. All someone really needs is a laptop, an internet connection, a bit of patience – and some nefarious intent. At the most basic level, all scammers need to do is find out who the boss of a company is and set up a spoofed, fake email address. From here, they send a request to an employee saying they need a financial transaction to be carried out quickly – and quietly. It's a very basic social-engineering attack, but often, it works. An employee keen to do as their boss demands could be quick to approve the transfer, which could be tens of thousands of dollars or more – particularly if they think they'll be chastised for delaying an important transaction. In more advanced cases, the attackers will break into the email of a colleague, your boss or a client and use their actual email address to request a transfer. Not only are staff more inclined to believe something that really does come from the account of someone they know, scammers can watch inboxes, wait for a real financial transaction to be requested, then send an email from the hacked account that contains their own bank details. By the time the victim realises something is wrong, the scammers have made off with the money and are long gone. What's most challenging about BEC attacks is that while it's a cyber crime that is based around abusing technology, there's actually very little that technology or software can do to help stop attacks because it's fundamentally a human issue. Anti-virus software and a good email spam filter can prevent emails containing malicious links or malware from arriving in your inbox. But if a legitimate hacked account is being used to send out requests to victims using messages in emails, that's a problem – because as far as the software is concerned, there's nothing nefarious to detect, and it's just another email from your boss or your colleague. And the money isn't stolen by clicking a link or using malware to drain an account – it's transferred by the victim to an account they've been told is legitimate. No wonder it's so hard for people to realise they're making a mistake. But victim blaming isn't the answer and isn't going to help – if anything, it will make the problem worse. What's important in the battle against BEC attacks is ensuring that people understand what these attacks are and to have processes in place that can prevent money being transferred. It should be explained that it's very unlikely that your boss will email you out of the blue asking for a very urgent transfer to be made with no questions asked. And if you do have concerns, ask a colleague – or even talk to your boss to ask if the request is legitimate or not. It might seem counterintuitive, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Businesses should also have procedures in place around financial transactions, particularly large ones. Should a single employee be able to authorise a business transaction valued at tens of thousands of dollars? Probably not. Businesses should ensure multiple people have to approve the process – yes, it might mean transferring finances takes a little longer, but it will help ensure that money isn't being sent to scammers and cyber criminals. That business deal can wait a few more minutes. Technology can help to a certain extent, but the reality is these attacks exploit human nature.

The NY Times joins the early media focus on the Sweepstakes alternatives to Trump and Republican's for 2028… With no clear standard-bearer, many Democrats anticipate a crowded primary field that could grow as large as — if not larger than — the 2019 lineup of more than two dozen candidates. Next week, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York is attending town halls with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in three Western states: Nevada, Arizona and Colorado. With Mr. Sanders now 83 and appearing to rule out a third presidential bid, there is an open progressive lane for someone like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, 35, who is not seen as especially likely to run but is often floated as a potential heir to Mr. Sanders. Much of the party's attention has turned to what many see as a talented, rising crop of governors. In contrast to 2019, when the Democratic primary race featured a historically diverse group of candidates, many of the prominent possible contenders are white men. Mr. Pritzker will be in Washington next Tuesday to speak at the Center for American Progress, a top liberal think tank, as the group hosts conversations on a path forward. Three Democratic governors — Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Andy Beshear of Kentucky — were also in the Washington area this week, extending their reach beyond their home states by addressing a closed-door retreat of congressional Democrats. After years of mostly keeping to Kentucky, Mr. Beshear has been bolstering his relationships with the party's donor class. He was selected as the vice chair of the Democratic Governors Association at the end of 2024 and will serve as chair of the group in 2026 — the year when three dozen races for governor will be on the ballot. Mr. Beshear is already planning to spend some money on an out-of-state race this spring, helping the liberal candidate in Wisconsin's Supreme Court fight, according to Eric Hyers, the governor's political adviser…. … And some long assumed to be out of politics seem to be clawing their way back in.

In just seven short years, Malone Lam Yu Xuan went from being a student in a secondary school in Choa Chu Kang to being dubbed crypto whizz-kid by some in the US in 2023. Many who saw his spending spree were amazed a 19-year-old could afford large mansions, a fleet of expensive cars and luxury clothes. In truth, Lam was living off the millions in crypto he stole from various investors, he later told investigators in the US. This was before August 2024, when he allegedly got involved in the theft of Bitcoin valued at more than US$240 million (S$320 million), one of the largest cryptocurrency thefts in US history. Legal documents obtained by The Straits Times showed that Lam, who turned 20 in 2024, had been living in the US on an expired tourist visa. Documents filed in a US court showed the then teenager pocketed millions and spent some of the money on himself and his friends. Among other things, he purchased and gifted a 2024 Mercedes SL and a 2023 Ferrari FS to Jeandiel Serrano. A year later, Lam and Serrano ended up as co-accused in the Bitcoin theft, where they allegedly stole more than 4,100 bitcoins from a single victim between Aug 18 and 19, 2024. Lam faces two indictments in the District of Columbia for conspiring to commit wire fraud, and for conspiracy to launder monetary instruments. Each of the charges carries a maximum jail term of 20 years. Singapore student Checks by ST showed Lam had enrolled in Unity Secondary School in Choa Chu Kang in 2017. But he left soon after, later telling investigators in the US that he had dropped out of school when he was between 13 and 14 years old. Lam was active online, especially in the gaming community. He went by the moniker Greavys in Minecraft and also used Anne Hathaway and Malone on various gaming platforms including Discord. Lam moved to the US in October 2023. He already knew Serrano, an American, by then. They met online while playing Minecraft and gained notoriety within the community for allegedly looting or stealing other players' accounts to sell for money. The authorities there said Lam had travelled on a visa waiver programme, which allows residents of 42 countries, including Singapore, to enter the US for 90 days for business or leisure purposes. His visa expired in January 2024, but he stayed on illegally. He spent time in Texas and Los Angeles and also travelled to Canada. While in the US, the gamer from Singapore developed a taste for the post and boast lifestyle, a term describing young people who flaunt on social media their expensive cars and clothes, big parties and even larger mansions. He claimed he was a crypto investor, court documents showed. But in reality, he got rich by hacking and stealing cryptocurrency. US prosecutor Jonathan Stratton described Lam as a sophisticated crypto fraudster when the Singaporean was first produced in a district court in South Florida in September 2024. In arguing against granting him bail, Mr Stratton said Lam presents two dangers. One is, he is obviously a sophisticated cryptocurrency fraudster. He executed one of the most significant cryptocurrency hacks in the country. He can do those kinds of hacking from anywhere, and there is no reasonable combination of conditions that pre-trial services can implement that will prevent his ability to further exploit crypto investors throughout the country, he said. The prosecutor added that Lam has an inclination to obstruct justice. The defendant was tipped off by his co-defendant's girlfriend and immediately engaged in further criminal activity by deleting his Telegram account and obstructing justice in this investigation, he said, adding that Lam's ability to hide electronic evidence is significant. After his arrest, Lam told investigators in the US that before the heist, he had made millions by engaging in various crypto scams. He said he used the stolen money to support his lifestyle. Lam, Serrano and their accomplices allegedly hit the jackpot in August 2024, and later divided the stolen funds among themselves. Lam amassed a fleet of 31 luxury vehicles - including a US$3.8 million Pagani Huayra, a US$1 million Lamborghini Revuelto, and custom Ferraris and Porsches.

The US authorities say 22 of Lam's vehicles have yet to be located by law enforcement, including a white Lamborghini he had adorned with his name. He also rented multiple mansions in Miami, paying US$68,000 in monthly rent on one residence alone, and also acquired multiple luxury watches - one of which was purchased for US$1.8 million. Prosecutors said that during this period, he became known in the Los Angeles nightclub scene because of the lavish bottle services he demanded. He even gave handbags valued at tens of thousands of dollars to people he barely knew. Social media influencers created videos detailing how Lam had given them handbags from French fashion house Hermes. Some influencers have taken to social media to show the free Hermes bags they received from Malone Lam. / Some influencers have taken to social media to show the free Hermes bags they received from Malone Lam. On Sept 11, 2024, influencer Skylar Harrison posted a video on TikTok detailing how she ran into Lam at a nightclub called Keys. While in the club, someone from Lam's entourage invited her to the section he was in, with the offer of a Hermes handbag. She added that she witnessed Lam purchasing around US$100,000 worth of alcohol within 10 minutes of meeting her. She said Lam claimed to be the son of a Chinese billionaire. Investigations revealed that he spent up to US$500,000 per night at nightclubs over the course of a few weeks and, on some occasions, tried to pay in cryptocurrency. That flashy lifestyle and his vanity contributed to his downfall. Investigators were looking for Lam and they found his name on a banner in a club where he spent hundreds of thousands. Court documents showed the authorities were watching him. A prosecutor said government surveillance caught Lam spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in a night. Lam's spending spree was also rife on social media platforms, with multiple videos showing him - decked out in designer clothes and jewellery - partying.

No ties The game was up after investigators identified Serrano. He was arrested on Sept 18, 2024, at the Los Angeles International Airport, after he returned from a holiday in the Maldives with his girlfriend. After she was interviewed, Serrano's girlfriend tipped off Lam - who was already in Miami after travelling from Los Angeles on a private jet. Investigators said the Singaporean was arrested as he tried to flee. He has been held in detention since his arrest. Prosecutors said Lam is a flight risk. He has substantial assets that have yet to be located, which they said provide him with the financial means to flee the jurisdiction. In September 2024, a Florida judge said Lam seemed to have very little ties to anywhere except Singapore. He has lived in Texas, LA, Canada. Just a bit of a rolling stone. No ties to South Florida. No other job except his self-admitted job as a crypto investor for the last eight months - and we know what he was doing investing other people's money, according to the indictment, the judge said. On March 7, Lam's lawyer, Mr Scott Armstrong, filed a notice indicating the Singaporean's intention to proceed to trial by jury. In response to queries from ST, Mr Armstrong said: Mr Lam is currently being held in Virginia pending his trial, which was set for October 2025. Lam is also intending to file other legal attacks , according to Mr Armstrong's application. This will include suppression motions that require the US government to produce meaningful discovery in the case against him. The lawyer said Lam is also calling for the immediate production of search warrant affidavits and reports relevant to the searches executed in his case in order to prepare his defence. In an earlier hearing, state prosecutors said that based on the amounts involved in the heist, Lam will likely face between 168 and 210 months' jail.

The 71-year-old admitted to police he was aware she was in the trap for about two hours but left her meowing in pain , RSPCA South Australia said in a statement on Sunday. A man used brickwork next to his fence to funnel his neighbour's cat into a steel-jaw trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) A man used brickwork next to his fence to funnel his neighbour's cat into a steel-jaw trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) After the injured cat was freed, an RSPCA inspector and police attended the man's property to find the steel-jaw trap had been reset. It had been set next to a hole in a fence and surrounded by brickwork, funnelling cats entering through the hole to walk directly into the trap. These are barbaric devices that inflict terrible injuries and cause enormous suffering, RSPCA SA Chief Inspector Andrew Baker said. It's tragic to think that some animals could become trapped and never found, leaving them to die in agony. One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap. (HANDOUT/RSPCA SA) Mr Baker hoped the prosecution of the man, convicted of animal cruelty and setting a steel-jaw trap, would deter others from using them. From RSPCA's perspective, there's no good reason to own a steel-jaw trap, he said. We encourage anyone who has one to turn it into scrap metal so that there is no possibility of it ever falling into the hands of a person who wants to harm animals. According to the RSPCA, the man was placed on a six-month good behaviour bond on Friday and ordered to pay Lunar's vet costs, exceeding $4000. One of Lunar's toes was crushed by the trap and required amputation.

Image: Eugene Krupnov Our daughter kept asking if we would die. Eugene Krupnov, developer of the popular Mac application Unclutter, found himself answering his eight-year-old daughter with a bit of pop-culture gallows humor. Not today, we joked, quoting Arya from Game of Thrones. On February 24, Krupnov and his family evacuated from Kyiv. As we were fleeing the city, we heard how the shelling escalated, we saw unthinkable traffic across the highways and endless lines at every gas station. It was night time. And it seemed like an apocalypse. Krupnov told ZDNet, A day after we left, an enemy rocket hit a high-rise building not far from our home in Kyiv. Ukraine has a very large tech sector. According to Bloomberg, the country boasts a quarter of a million tech professionals, many of whom provide coding services to major players like Apple, Google, Lyft, Ubisoft, Daimler, BMW, Citi, and JPMorgan, among many others. According to the trade group IT Ukraine Association, as reported in the Wall Street Journal, IT export volume, increased 36% to $6.8 billion last year, up from $5 billion in 2020 and $4.2 billion in 2019. According to Ukrainian developer outsource firm Daxx, via research from SkillValue, Ukraine's developers rank 5th worldwide in terms of overall competence. There are also thousands of entrepreneurial companies building their own software products. We spoke to eight of them this week. Tanya Vert is a PR specialist at BeLight Software. I've spoken to her over the years, particularly when I reviewed Live Home 3D. The idea for this article occurred to me when I was using Live Home 3D last week to rearrange my home workshop. Here I was using a product to rearrange my home, when the developers were losing theirs. The BeLight team is spread across Ukraine now, with half of the team staying in Odesa. When I checked in with Vert, she told me, There are air raid alarms several times a day, explosions are heard all the time. People spend several hours every day in shelters. There is no subway in Odesa, so underground parking lots, basements and corridors inside buildings serve as shelters. Every night, we enjoy missiles, drones and air defense performance in the sky over the sea. Image: Headway startup Bohdan Toporivsky is SEO and Content Manager, also at Unclutter. He shared what he calls our life these days with me. The first days we had more confusion, panic and anxiety. Now you almost get used to things, and just have to care less. I try to consume less news, as it often brings stress and sadness. In his email, he told me, We are happy to have enough food and clothes – too many Ukrainians don't have that luxury. Most of my other friends I text with are holding up relatively well too. It's rather hard to sleep, air raid alert wakes us up once or twice a night (more during the day) and we go to the basement a.k.a. bomb shelter. Image: Bohdan Toporivsky Right now, he's living in a refugee/guest house of a local church. We settled there, he said, not knowing for how long. It's been almost a month now. In the past week, I've spoken to eight companies either based in Ukraine or with large teams who work there. Amidst the horror of war, there were two themes that became apparent during our conversations: their efforts to maintain business continuity, and the Ukrainian spirit of their team members. Business continuity and data security Skylum is a company known for its Luminar and Aurora HDR photo editing products. Many in the Mac community know them by their original name, MacPhun. According to a post by CEO Ivan Kutanin, his team of 130 is currently scattered across Ukraine and the world. Despite all the pressures he and his company are facing, one of the most important messages he wants his customers to hear is one of reassurance, Rest assured that we securely host all of our infrastructure and user data on Amazon Web Services. All servers for this cloud service are located in the European Union and are not in Ukraine, so you can be confident that your data is securely stored. The CEO of a software company is doing his best to reassure his customers about their security, while his own team is working out of bomb shelters, on the road, or in the homes of relatives and friends in safer locations. MacPaw is another company very familiar to Mac users. They make CleanMyMac X, GeminiPhotos, and the Setapp Mac software subscription service. In a letter to ZDNet, Oleksandr Kosovan, MacPaw's CEO and founder told us, MacPaw is a company from Ukraine and operates primarily in Kyiv. Part of our team decided to stay in Ukraine to defend our country and help people in need. Some team members moved abroad to safer places with their families and kids. According to Kosovan, Those team members who are already outside of Ukraine are working to maintain MacPaw products and the stability of the company's services. While preparing for the massive invasion, the company also organized an office in Ivano-Frankivsk, Western Ukraine. We prepared the company to work completely autonomously. Kosovan told us he is staying in Kyiv, to protect Ukraine and stop the war in any way possible. So is MacPaw CTO Vera Tkachenko. In a tweet, she says, Seventh day of a war. I'm staying in Kyiv and have to move to a shelter several times a day. Food and medicine supplies are limited. Civilians in suburbs are attacked with bombs several times a day. But our defense forces are real heros and we'll win! Readdle is a Ukrainian-founded company that produces Spark email and PDF Expert. In an email conversation with Maria Henyk, Readdle's PR & marketing manager, she told us, We're equipping a location in Odesa as a shelter for the team, their families, and their pets. The company is providing financial help for all Ukrainian employees, along with assistance for those who can and want to move abroad. There are many different situations being experienced by our people, Henyk told us. Some have returned to 80-100% work capacity, others are still in shock, while others are experiencing air-raid alarms every few hours. Henyk asked us to share this message, As for our customers, nothing has changed for them. For many years, we've been investing in the safety and security of our systems and products, so everything customer-facing is up and running. Millions of people worldwide rely on our products, receiving timely updates and customer support. Anna Ustynova provides communications and global PR for Headway, a maker of a motivational app. In an email, she told ZDNet, Since the beginning of the invasion, the top priority of Headway has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees and their families in Ukraine. We have launched an emergency plan, and now over 95% of the Ukrainian Headway teammates and their families, who desired to move, are in a safe place. She continued: Our Kyiv R&D unit settled down partly in the west of Ukraine, partly abroad. No employee was fired; instead, Headway is going to hire more Ukrainian talents and all previously sent offers were secured and already two employees have joined us since 24th February. Ajax System makes smart alarms popular in Europe. Valentine Hrytsenko, chief marketing officer at Ajax Systems told ZDNet, Since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, our company is doing everything necessary to ensure the protection and safety of its people, business, and supplies to partners. As with the other companies seeking to retain some level of normality in the midst of war, Hrytsenko sought to reassure customers, The Ajax server infrastructure functions without interruption, so users and partners don't have to worry about the stability of already installed systems. Ajax's servers are geographically dispersed throughout Europe in Amazon data centers in Ireland and Germany. Grammarly makes a well-known cloud-based writing assistant. According to Jen Dakin, consumer PR manager, Grammarly's first priority remains the safety and well-being of our team members. We have implemented our contingency plans that include relocating team members and their families to help them remain safe. Beyond that, Dakin was keeping operational security for Grammarly, telling us only, To protect the safety of our team members, we won't be providing further details of our contingency plans or team member locations. These developers are doing their best to reassure their customers that their services will continue, even as their world is being blown apart around them. Each of these teams spent years building their companies and products into successes, and ensuring continuity of their businesses – in the worst and most scary of conditions -- is also about survival. If their companies suffer or shutter, they lose their livelihoods too. But there's so much more. Each of these companies shared with me their contributions to the war effort. Ukrainian spirit Jen Dakin told us, Grammarly will donate all of the net revenue earned from Russia and Belarus since the war started in 2014 through 2022 to causes supporting Ukraine—totaling over $5 million. Hrytsenko of Ajax Systems told us about work the company is doing with the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine. He described an app Ajax built called Air Alert that instantly informs about the beginning and end of a civil defense alert. The app generates a loud critical alert warning of an airstrike, chemical attack, or other types of civil defense alerts. The app receives signals first-hand from Ukrainian regional administrations, allowing people to react as quickly as possible. Readdle's Henyk told ZDNet about the dedication of the company's employees and how the company is supporting them, Many people are taking part in volunteering projects, and some have joined territorial defense forces. We are proud of our team and such strength and bravery and are keeping their positions open and paying all salaries for all people as normal. In her email to us, she continued: Readdle employees themselves have donated tens of thousands of dollars to the Ukrainian defense, and the company has matched this amount. MacPaw's Kosovan shared his pride in his team: MacPaw team members volunteer to provide food and medicine, support Ukrainian Army, donate blood and money to Ukrainian charities like other Ukrainian citizens all over the country. Some of us are fighting in the Ukrainian Army, Territorial Defense, and the Ukrainian IT Army. Kosovan also tells us that since the beginning of the war, MacPaw has been actively involved in delivering humanitarian aid to Ukrainians in need through the MacPaw Development Fund. In an email to ZDNet he said, The MacPaw Development Fund is able to quickly source and distribute large quantities of food, medical supplies, hygiene products, and other humanitarian aid to those in need. The Fund can do it faster than most larger organizations and this can help save lives when every moment counts. Through the Fund, to date, MacPaw has spent over $4M to provide food, medical supplies, and other necessities to Ukrainians in the war zones. BeLight's Vert told us a little more about how her team is supporting the war effort: We keep working from home now and help Ukraine in every way we can. Some with donations, others are helping Territorial Defense with supplies, or with the preparation of Molotov cocktails (a special explosive substance used by civilians to fight the occupants), some joined the regional branch of the Red Cross in Uzhhorod, Western Ukraine, as a volunteer. For Unclutter's Toporivsky, it's all about volunteering. He told ZDNet, A few days after the war began and we moved to that safer place, we understood that we could not just wait, read awful news, and take no action anymore. And four of us began doing whatever we could to somehow help our Ukrainian defenders and victims of war. Then six of us, then many more in different cities of Ukraine and beyond, Toporivsky said in an email. Thanks to various friends with connections to the Ukrainian army, volunteers, and funds, we started arranging humanitarian help from Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, and other European countries. Food, medicines, clothes, hygiene products, etc. Military equipment and protection too, when possible. There aren't many of us, and the scale could be much bigger – we still try and do what we can, says Toporivsky. It's hardly possible to do regular work nowadays. Hoping I'll get back to it later, when things slow down. After all, our warriors need all the support they can get, on all fronts. Life in Ukraine Unclutter CEO Krupnov told us, We've been planning to release a major update this fall. And minor updates this spring. But now all the development has come to a halt. We're only able to provide user support. Imagine that your life has completely changed in just a few days, Krupnov said. It's emptiness, fear for your loved ones, and shame you feel because you don't do enough for your country. It's a sensation of overwhelming despair each time you read about murdered civilians and children or soldiers who died protecting their homeland. It's also destroyed cities - the places you loved and felt connected to. Still, he's hopeful. Though we're scattered across the globe now, we still keep in touch and support each other. Some day, after the victory, we will get together once again to continue our work after a great celebration. If you want to help, we've provided a number of donation sites and resources you can explore in the companion article, Ukraine: How you can help.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/ukrainian-software-developers-share-their-stories-and-photos-from-the-war-zone/
PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — J.J. Spaun watched his 25-foot putt swirl 360 degrees around the cup and drop for par, a fitting end to a wild, windy, round-wrecking Saturday at The Players Championship that gave him a one-shot lead going into the final round of the richest tournament in golf. The par gave Spaun a 2-under 70, the lowest score among the final 10 groups that teed off in a strong, steady wind with gusts up to 25 mph on a course that can be intimidating even when the conditions are calm. Bud Cauley teed off two hours earlier and still faced a bulk of the wind. He finished with three birdies on his last four holes for a 66 to be in the final group. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement For so many others — even those very much in the mix — it was a matter of hanging on for dear life. Lucas Glover had a 71 and finished with a double bogey on the 15th, an eagle by chipping in on the par-5 16th, and a double bogey with a tee shot that didn't reach the island on the notorious par-3 17th. It's pretty razor thin around here anyway, Glover said. And then you add in 25, 30 miles an hour with some gusts, it shrinks things even more. I did a good job where I was missing for the majority of the day, and there was a couple holes where you just can't miss. Spaun was at 12-under 204, a stroke ahead of Cauley and three ahead of Glover and Alex Smalley. There was plenty of heartache, not including the five rounds in the 80s. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Will Zalatoris was briefly tied for the lead when he stepped on the 14th tee. He played the final five holes in 9-over par — a quadruple bogey on the 14th, a double bogey on the 15th, a ball in the water on the 17th for double bogey and a bogey at the last. It added to a 78. He went from tied for the lead to 10 shots behind in the span of about an hour. Rory McIlroy made birdie on the final hole to salvage a 73 and perhaps his chances, leaving him only four shots behind. Most of the dropped shots were from around-the-green mistakes rather than tee-to-green, McIlroy said. I felt like I hit the ball pretty well, controlled my flight. Not out of it by any means The wind is supposed to still be blowing tomorrow, so yeah, it was nice to birdie that just to get one closer to J.J. on the last. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Two-time defending champion Scottie Scheffler wasn't so fortunate. He was hanging around and poised to get closer until he went from the pine straw left of the par-5 16th fairway to a bunker, then another bunker under a large tree and wound up with a bogey. He three-putted from long range for bogey on the 17th, tossing his ball into the water. He hit what he thought was a perfect wedge on the 18th only to see it roll off the back of the green. He had a 72. A year ago, Scheffler birdied his last three holes to get within five shots and wound up winning with a 64. This time he played bogeyed two of the last three and was seven behind. Is that too much? Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I'm not really thinking about it too much right now, he said. I'm just a bit frustrated with the finish but hoping to come out of the gates a little bit better tomorrow and turn things around. The forecast was for more wind and enough rain that the PGA Tour moved up the tee times to send players off in threesomes from both sides Sunday morning. Akshay Bhatia put up a good fight after a miserable start, going from a birdie on the opening hole to a bogey-bogey-double bogey stretch that sent him spiraling down the leaderboard. He still wound up with a chance. Collin Morikawa had more of a slow bleed with eight bogeys that sent him to 77, leaving him eight shots behind. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The group at 7-under 209 included Patrick Cantlay and Danny Walker, who left Friday evening after a three-putt that looked as though it would cost him the cut. But he made it on the number, teed off first before the wind arrived and posted a 66. Walker didn't get into the tournament until Jason Day withdrew Thursday morning. Now he's in the mix with so many others, chasing the $4.5 million prize from a $25 million purse that includes a five-year exemption on the PGA Tour. ___ AP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf|2025-03-16|https://www.yahoo.com/news/j-j-spaun-takes-lead-234540234.html

A sea of people converged in Serbia's capital Belgrade Saturday in what was the largest in a series of anti-corruption demonstrations that have upended the Balkan country in recent months. At one point the crowd stretched for nearly two kilometres, with people filling the streets in and around the parliament and the capital's main pedestrian square. We have gathered in the streets primarily to express our complete dissatisfaction after years of dictatorship, lawlessness, and corruption, said one demonstrator, Ognjen Djordjevic, a 28-year-old resident from Belgrade. The movement formed after 15 people were killed when a railway station roof collapsed in the city of Novi Sad in November, igniting long-simmering anger over alleged corruption and lax oversight in construction projects. After Saturday's rally, the interior ministry said that at least 107,000 people had turned out. The Public Assembly Archive -- a group that monitors crowd size -- gave a much higher figure. It estimated that between 275,000 to 325,000 people took to the streets. If that estimate was correct, that would make Saturday's protest one of the largest in Serbia's recent history. - 'Incidents and clashes' - For weeks, student-led protesters have criss-crossed the country, holding rallies in Serbia's major cities. They have also taken their anti-corruption crusade to the rural areas and small towns that have long been the backbone of Vucic's support. Their return to Belgrade on Saturday ramped up already compounding pressure on President Aleksandar Vucic's government, with several high-ranking officials, including the prime minister, having resigned in recent months. Saturday's protest, like the others before it, cut across a wide-spectrum of society, bringing together those aligned with the far left and right. Amid scores of Serbian flags, some waved banners calling for environmental protection, while others demanded the return of the former breakaway province of Kosovo. Following hours of peaceful protests, police later reported that there had been some incidents and clashes among some participants of the protests. Around 7:20 pm (18:20 GMT), a leading student group called on all protesters to exit the area near the parliament, citing security concerns after bottles and stones were allegedly thrown. The reports of scattered incidents came as fears rose over potential clashes with supporters of Vucic's embattled government, who had also gathered in the capital. - Vukic defiant - In the days leading up to the protest, ultranationalists, and militia members camped out near the parliament and presidency. Ahead of the protest, layers of riot police earlier fanned out near the encampment and around the parliament. Late Saturday, President Vucic took to the airways again. There were no casualties or serious injuries, Vucic said during the national address. I'm proud of the police who ensured security for all participants, he added, saying he believed 99 percent of students had remained peaceful. A day earlier, Vucic had struck a defiant tone, saying he would not let the streets set the rules in this country . - 'Regime escalating tensions' - Some analysts had earlier warned that the situation would escalate. We can already see for a few days that the regime is trying to escalate tensions, said political analyst Srdjan Cvijic. Government-backed media also broadcasted increasingly inflammatory accusations, saying the students are planning to launch a coup , with Vucic accusing the demonstrators of organising large-scale violence . However, the day passed with no major incidents. Farmers, students, bikers and other civilians mingled along the main thoroughfares in downtown Belgrade, as a parade of tractors headed toward the parliament as crowds amassed. Ahead of the main afternoon protest, thousands also stood for 15 minutes of silence beginning at 11:52 am to honour the victims of the Novi Sad tragedy, with the time marking the moment of the roof's collapse. The ritual was repeated again in the evening, as a sprawling crowd at a major traffic roundabout waved their illuminated mobile phones in the air. We came for justice, Milica Stojanovic, a student at the Faculty of Biology in Belgrade, told AFP. I hope that after this protest, things will change, she added mp-ds/jj|2025-03-16|https://www.sanfordherald.com/news/national/massive-anti-graft-rally-engulfs-serbias-capital/article_ac5d8f9f-cfbd-5877-871b-9dc54033b8b5.html

MARLOW — About 30 residents came out to John D. Perkins Academy Elementary School Saturday morning for the annual town meeting, according to selectboard member Robert Allen. Voters approved the $1,064,823 budget, up $82,556, or 8.4 percent, from the $982,267 budget voters approved last year. Town Executive Administrator Jacqui Fay previously attributed the hike to increases in staffing expenses and costs associated with information technology and communications. Residents decided against continuing the town's long-standing tradition of offering a two percent cash discount on all property taxes that are paid in full within 10 business days after issuance of the bill. Allen said that was a somewhat surprising move because it's an article that typically passes, but noted residents felt this year that it's not something the town needs to offer. According to Allen, the remainder of the warrant was uncontroversial, with voters approving a $30,000 appropriation to make repairs to the Highway Barn and authorizing cemetery trustees to update cemetery rules without those changes being voted on by future town meetings. Voters also passed several articles adding money to the town's trust funds and capital reserve funds, including $25,000 for the road improvement fund and $20,000 to the fire truck and ambulance capital reserve fund. The 30-strong crowd represents a voter turnout of about five percent.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/marlow-voters-pass-budget-most-warrant-articles-in-quiet-meeting/article_c46f4486-01d6-11f0-b485-a3f1b30d25fe.html

Samrudhdi Kerkar As winter fades and deciduous trees shed their leaves, Goa prepares for a season of celebration. Following Mahashivratri, Goans immerse themselves in fairs, festivals, ritualistic dances, and spirited recitations, culminating in the grandeur of Shigmo. Deeply woven into Goa's cultural fabric, Shigmo unfolds in the last month of the lunar calendar, bringing communities together in vibrant revelry. The name Shigmo is said to have evolved from Sugimha, meaning 'Let summer be pleasant'—a fitting invocation for the changing season. Rooted in agrarian and warrior traditions, Shigmo blends myth, devotion, and folk expression. Its music, played on traditional instruments like the dhol, taso, shehnai, and kansallem (cymbals), carries echoes of the past while driving the festival's energy. Every village comes alive with the Romat (musical procession), filled with the deep beats of the dhol and taso, the melodies of the shehnai, the sharp chimes of kansallem, and occasional sounds of string instruments. Folk songs blend with the music, expressing life's joys and sorrows. As the rhythm builds, dancers—covered in bright colours—move freely, lost in the moment. From the hills of Canacona to the coast of Pernem, Goan folk music comes alive. The Romtamel becomes an outpouring of joy, where artists, caught in the moment, enter a trance, leaving their daily struggles behind. In villages like Saal, Narve, Kudne, Piligao, and Amona, Gadeutsav brings people from across Goa for a night of mystery and devotion. One ritual that has always intrigued me is the invocation (Garanhe), sung together to the steady beat of the dhol. As the night goes on, the Gade (devotees) start dancing, giving themselves over to a power beyond explanation. The air reverberates with the beat of the dhol, voices rise in chorus, and the atmosphere becomes electric. In Gadeutsav, music is not just heard—it is felt. The rhythm guides devotees into a deep state of immersion where time dissolves, revealing only sound and devotion. As a child, I watched in awe, convinced it was impossible. But as I doubted, I felt the ground vibrate with each beat of the dhol. My heartbeat synchronised with the rhythm, sending goosebumps through me. In that moment, I realised the trance wasn't just theirs—I could feel it too. The fervour of Gadeutsav is a form of spiritual ecstasy, where drumming and movement induce a heightened state of consciousness. Many dancers prepare through fasting and devotion, surrendering completely to the music. In doing so, they deepen their connection with the divine, the earth, and each other. A folk song called Sokarati captures its essence—Shok signifies suffering, while aarti represents devotion. Sung during Karavlyo, a festival honouring the Satis—women who immolated themselves on their husbands' funeral pyres after they fell in war—the haunting melody carries the weight of history, echoing voices of mourning and faith.

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://1059thex.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
Facebook.com Instagram: Instagram.com TikTok: Tiktok.com MuseumBlogs1klein Hello Community, today I want to show you an overview of the trailers I have released in the years Behind the Horizon has been running. In the trailers you can see how the game has changed and how my experience with videos has increased. It is quite funny.. ;-) ! Let's start with the first trailer from 2018: After a some time, this trailer appeared (2020): Then one from 2021: After that there are 4 more trailers, but they don't differ much from each other. I have only tried to update the progress in the graphics in each trailer. That's why I'm only showing two more of them: Version V2.0 (2023): Version V3.6 (brand new 2025): I hope you enjoyed this journey through time! By the way, if you don't have the game yet, you shouldn't hesitate any longer, because it's really worth it now... Have a nice day :-) !

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://590kqnt.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's New South Wales on Sunday sweated in a heat wave that raised the risk of bushfires and prompted authorities to issue a total fire ban for state capital Sydney. New South Wales, coming to the end of a high risk bushfire season that runs until the end of March, was a focus of a catastrophic 2019-2020 Black Summer of wildfires that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. On Sunday, the nation's weather forecaster said temperatures would be up to 12 degrees Celsius (21.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above average in some areas of the state, with temperatures in Sydney, Australia's most populous city, set to hit 37C (98.6F). Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement At Sydney Airport, the temperature was already 29.3C (84.7 F) at 9:30 a.m. local time, more than three degrees above the March mean maximum temperature, according to forecaster data. Gusty winds, hot conditions and low relative humidity will result in extreme fire danger over the greater Sydney region, the forecaster said on its website. The state's Rural Fire Service said on X that a total fire ban was in place for large swaths of the state including Sydney due to the forecast of hot, dry and windy conditions . In neighbouring Victoria state, a home was destroyed in a bushfire on the outskirts of Melbourne that was being battled by around 200 firefighters, Country Fire Authority official Bernard Barbetti told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Sunday. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Climate change is causing extreme heat and fire weather to become more common in Australia, a bushfire-prone country of around 27 million, the country's science agency said last year.

The U.S. economy has produced the world's most valuable companies for more than a century. United States Steel became the first $1 billion company in 1901, and 117 years later in 2018, Apple became the first enterprise to achieve a valuation of $1 trillion. Apple remains the world's largest company with a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion. But since 2018, several other American organizations have joined it in the trillion-dollar club, including Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Berkshire Hathaway. Tesla and Broadcom were also members until they recently suffered sharp declines in their stock prices. I think one more company has the potential to cross the $1 trillion milestone in the coming years. Oracle(NYSE: ORCL) operates some of the best data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence (AI) development, and management's guidance suggests this part of its business could grow tenfold over the long term. Oracle is valued at $403 billion as of this writing, so investors who buy the stock today could earn a whopping 148% gain if it does join the $1 trillion club. Demand for AI data centers is through the roof There are two key phases involved in developing an AI model: The training phase is when a developer feeds the model mountains of data for it to learn from, and the inference phase is when the model accepts inputs from users and generates responses (like when you interact with a chatbot). Both require a substantial amount of computing power, and most developers source it from companies like Oracle. Oracle operates some of the best AI data centers in the world. They are fitted with state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs) from leading suppliers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which are chips specifically designed to handle AI workloads. In fact, Oracle is currently building a cluster of 64,000 Nvidia Blackwell GB200 GPUs -- not only is that the most powerful chip in the industry right now, but this will also be one of the largest clusters on offer by any data center operator. When developers have access to more chips, they can process more data, more quickly, and thus deploy much smarter AI models. But scale isn't Oracle's only advantage, because its proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology allows data to move from one point to another much faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Since developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, this can result in significant cost savings. Oracle opened its 101st data center cloud region during its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended on Feb. 28), but demand continued to significantly outstrip supply. In fact, chairman Larry Ellison said GPU usage for AI training purposes alone has soared by a staggering 244% over the last 12 months, and the company is also seeing enormous demand for inference workloads.|2025-03-16|https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-super-stock-could-join-222800687.html
A pair of surging teams will have their winning streaks on the line Saturday night when the Houston Rockets host the Chicago Bulls. Houston (42-25), a winner of five games in a row, has a chance to inch closer to the No. 2 spot in the Western Conference standings. The Rockets trail the Denver Nuggets by a game. The Rockets, who are nearing the end of their five-year postseason drought, extended their recent good fortune with Friday's 133-96 blowout of the Dallas Mavericks. A trend throughout Houston's resurgent season has been its work on the glass. The Rockets boast an NBA-best average of 48.5 rebounds per game, with the dominance on full display Friday. Houston outrebounded Dallas 67-34, including a 17-6 on offense. One of our points of emphasis this season was to be the best offensive rebounding team in the league, Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. Obviously we showed that tonight; we had 29 second-chance points off of 17 offensive rebounds and then 28 fast-break points. Turning defense into offense is always a good formula for us. We're at our best when we do that. Houston's Alperen Sengun recorded 15 of those rebounds on Friday, which were paired with his 16 points and four assists. Tari Eason led the way with a career-high 30 points for the Rockets, who surpassed last year's win total and clinched their first winning season since the 2019-20 campaign. Jalen Green paces the team with an average of 21.1 points per game, followed by Sengun (19.2) and Fred VanVleet (14.3). Chicago (28-38) has pieced together a season-long four-game winning streak to pull within a game of the slumping Miami Heat for ninth place in the Eastern Conference. The Bulls trail the eighth-place Orlando Magic by two games and sit 3 1/2 behind the No. 7 Atlanta Hawks. In the midst of trying to save what appeared to be a hapless season, Chicago extended its winning streak on Thursday with a 116-110 home victory over the Brooklyn Nets. The Bulls held the Nets to 18 points in the fourth quarter, helping Chicago overcome a 12-point third-quarter deficit. The group's defensive intensity certainly hasn't been a mainstay this season, as it ranks second-worst with 120.2 points per game allowed, but Thursday may have been a step in the right direction. We've been trying to talk about it all year long — we're not going to make shots every night, coach Billy Donovan said. I think there's a mental resiliency component when it comes to finding other ways to win. The Bulls have had no shortage of production over their last four games, led by Coby White's 31.3 scoring average over the stretch. White's 19.3 ppg for the season leads the team, while Nikola Vucevic chips in 18.8 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Chicago and Houston met on Nov. 17, with the Rockets breezing to a 143-107 win. Sengun recorded a 20-point, 11-rebound, 11-assists triple-double in the victory.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/rockets-look-to-continue-ascent-vs-streaking-bulls/
atjeffrey@paterson-valuations.comor call207-529-5639. January was a month of growth, learning, and teamwork for the 4-H Byre Clan, a vibrant youth farming club based in Bristol. Under the leadership of Club Leader Jeffrey Patterson and the support of dedicated volunteers, members engaged in a range of hands-on activities, furthering their agricultural skills while contributing to the care of Byre Farm's animals. Following the first All You Can Eat pancake breakfast in December, the Club was set to host a Community Breakfast in February at Dot's Bakery in Bristol. At the start of the month, Club members attended a chicken health visit with Dr. Flash at Boothbay Animal Hospital. During the visit, Dr. Flash examined two hens—Winter, a white and gray Bantam, and Peggy, a senior Buff Orpington—while demonstrating key aspects of chicken health monitoring. This included checking the throat, eyes, leg, and foot movement, comb and wattle color, and weight. Winter was found to have a loose ligament in her right leg, and Dr. Flash taught Byre Clan members how to apply a hobble to support her legs. Thanks to this treatment, Winter can now stand independently. We're happy to report that she has rejoined the flock in a protected area and, with the hobble, is once again able to stand and walk! January was a cold month, but that didn't stop Byre Clan members and volunteers from enjoying time outside, working with the bull calf team of Fernando and Winston, visiting Don Silkie of Jefferson, and preparing for the upcoming maple sap harvest season! Club members visited Don Silkie at his shop in Jefferson. Don makes yokes and bows of various sizes and handcrafted goads. Club members learned how Don starts with a large piece of wood, like hickory or white oak, and refines the piece until it is ready to be put to work with various steer teams across Maine. Don's gracious and welcoming approach put the Club members at ease, and many jumped in to use the tools to sand some goads Don had prepared for them. To close out the visit, Don demonstrated with his steer team of Jack and Jim. The Club's bull calf team, Fernando and Winston, continues to grow in size and skillset! On average, each of these good boys is gaining 20 pounds per week, eating well, and getting lots of socialization. With Club members as their drivers, Fernando and Winston are now pulling 100 pounds and have started learning how to pull small logs from one point to another. The Byre Clan Club continues to raise funds to support this bull calf Teaming Project. In February the Club planned to tap maple trees at their host farm, the Byre Farm. Patterson coordinated the maple harvesting project. Members and volunteers were to tap trees, learning tree identification from arborist Ian Hodgkiss, learning to boil sap with Jim Hazel of I'd Tap That Sugar Shack, and completing an introductory course Maple Sugaring 101 through UMaine Cooperative Extension. In addition to all this, lambs are on the way! A busy March lies ahead! The Byre Clan's activities showcase the dedication and enthusiasm of its members and volunteers. From learning woodcraft, maple harvesting, training calves, and hosting community events, the club continues to make a positive impact in Bristol and beyond. Whether you're interested in joining, volunteering, or supporting their efforts, there's a place for you at the Byre Farm. The Byre Clan meets at Byre Farm, 25 Rock School House Road in Bristol. Open to youth ages 8-18, the club provides an opportunity to engage in hands-on farming experiences while building teamwork and leadership skills. Prospective members and their families are encouraged to visit the farm to meet the animals and learn more about the club.

GREEN LAKE, Wis. - A drone team and others worked to rescue three deer that fell through thin ice Saturday on Big Green Lake. What we know: Three deer fell through the ice and were trying to go further into the lake, according to the Green Lake Police Department. Big Green Lake is the deepest, natural inland lake in Wisconsin at 236 feet. The Green Lake County Sheriff's Office drone team, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and a police officer helped herd two of the deer back to shallow water. However, the third deer did not follow. Wind pushed ice around, the police department said, making rescue efforts difficult, but a detective ultimately got the third deer close to shore where officers used a rope to help get the animal up the bank. What we don't know: It's unclear how long the deer were in the water and where they fell in.

(AP) — that ripped through parts of the U.S. proved deadly as well as destructive as whipping winds moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, with at least 17 people killed and scores of homes decimated. The most fatalities as of Saturday morning were in Missouri, authorities said, which was pounded by scattered twisters overnight that resulted in at least 11 deaths. The Missouri State Highway Patrol also reported that multiple people were injured. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. However, rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said. Officials in Arkansas said on Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency in their respective states. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving toward the state later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes have been damaged or destroyed in Oklahoma due to fire. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) have burned so far in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. This is terrible out here, said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes, some of which could be long-track and violent, are expected Saturday afternoon and evening. The region at highest risk stretches from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi in the afternoon and then and western portions of Georgia and the Florida panhandle in the evening, the Center said. Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditions Apart from Oklahoma, wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. SEC cancels Party in the Park The Southeastern Conference already had canceled outdoor activities around Saturday's men's basketball tournament semifinals in Nashville, Tennessee, due to the weather forecast. With Saturday bringing heavy rain leaving water pooling at the Music City Walk of Fame Park across from Bridgestone Arena, league officials canceled Sunday's SEC Party in the Park. They also opened arena doors a bit earlier to let fans in out of heavy downpours. Blizzard warnings in Northern Plains The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.|2025-03-16|https://newschannel9.com/news/nation-world/monster-storm-leaves-17-dead-as-tornadoes-and-wildfires-ravage-the-us-mississippi-valley-deep-south-fatalities-debris-damage-states-of-emergency-oklahoma-texas-arkansas
Islamophobia had 'a long time to germinate within society' and paved the way for violence and discrimination to be perpetrated and justified, says Zine, a professor at Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University HAMILTON, Canada Islamophobia in Canada has reached an unprecedented point, surpassing even the surge of anti-Muslim sentiment after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks, an expert on Muslim studies has warned. Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism have escalated dramatically since Oct. 7, 2023 and the Gaza genocide, with levels that were actually higher than after 9/11, Jasmin Zine, a professor at Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University, told Anadolu ahead of the International Day to Combat Islamophobia, marked globally on March 15. The growing hostility towards Muslims is not just confined to Canada, she added, and represents a deeply concerning global phenomenon, with manifestations across various regions, including China, Myanmar, India, Kashmir, and Gaza. The impact of Islamophobia on Canadian Muslims is compounded by both global geopolitics as well as the local context and reality, said Zine. She pointed to several hate-motivated incidents in Canada as evidence of the disturbing trend, including worshippers in Toronto being assaulted with rocks and bike chains, and a mosque in Ottawa being vandalized and defaced with feces. According to a 2023 report by the country's Senate Committee on Human Rights, Canada leads G7 countries in terms of targeted killings of Muslims motivated by Islamophobia. Zine sees this grim situation as symptomatic of a homegrown culture of anti-Muslim sentiment within Canadian society, perpetuated by societal and structural biases, such as Quebec's Bill 21, which prohibits the wearing of religious symbols in public sectors, or racial profiling at borders, and increased surveillance of Muslim groups and charities. Islamophobia has done its job over the past 20 years … Islamophobia has had a long time to germinate within society and that's made it a lot easier for these kinds of acts of violence to be perpetrated, but also to be legitimated and justified, she said. Anti-Muslim rhetoric and propaganda is now very normalized within people's minds, she said, referring to a 2022 poll where more than two in five respondents – 43% – viewed Islam as a harmful presence in Canada. Even as far back as 2012, there was a survey that found that 52% of Canadians distrusted Muslims, and 42% believe that the discrimination that Muslims faced was basically their own fault, she added. Politics and media: Justifying discrimination Zine particularly criticized how political and media discourses in Canada have fanned Islamophobia, saying: I think it's not just downplayed. It's also actually being exacerbated by … xenophobic policies and practices. She referred explicitly now-former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's assertions about being a Zionist: Narratives like that are promoting Zionism at a time where we're seeing a genocide … That is really problematic. That kind of political rhetoric is very much then authorizing those kinds of violent (anti-Muslim) actions to continue. It's not condemning them; it's actually contributing to legitimating those kinds of actions. Zine also expressed concern about the deeply ingrained perception of Muslims as dangerous or threatening within many Western societies, including Canada. She argued that this perception has historical roots, drawing parallels with the aftermath of the US-led war on terror. The global war on terror was the precursor, and that was also underpinned by racist ideologies that cast 2 billion people around the world as violent fanatical terrorists who were threatening democracy, threatening the stability of white nations and Western civilization as a whole, she said. These narratives persist today, she said, continuing to fuel the dehumanization of Muslims, especially Palestinians, and laying the groundwork for violence and discrimination. We heard references to Palestinians as 'human animals,' as 'barbaric,' as 'monsters.' That reproduced the idioms of colonial racism that were used to authorize and justify colonial violence, she said. There's a historical continuity there, and that dehumanization of Palestinians has been the precursor, as we've seen, to this wholesale genocide, she added, referring to Israel's devastating assault on the Gaza Strip, which has killed or wounded more than 150,000 Palestinians and left the besieged enclave in ruins. Despite this grim analysis, Zine identified a source of optimism in grassroots movements, particularly among young people and students advocating for Palestinian rights. The pro-Palestine protests seen at universities around the world give me hope for that generation moving forward and becoming leaders in other spheres of life where they're desperately needed, because we have a crisis of leadership around these issues, she said.

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.harrowtimes.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/

Keep your job come next Election? Before answering an attendee's question about President Donald Trump's destructive and disastrous trade war, U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards made a plea to the rowdy crowd at his Thursday town hall in Asheville, North Carolina. Let me answer and then if you don't like it, you can boo or hiss or whatever you'd like to do, Edwards said, visibly exhausted. As he expanded on Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tactic, it took less than a minute for the crowd to break out in outrage. He continued to plow ahead in his response and eventually punctuated it by telling attendees he would stop there and you can yell. The crowd gladly took him up on the offer. For about an hour and half, Edwards endured a constant barrage of jeers, expletives and searing questions on Trump administration policies.

Los Angeles, CA – February 6, 2025 — MTN WTR Co, the pioneering brand behind the first Japanese naturally alkaline water in the U.S., continues its momentum since debuting in 2022. Driven by a mission of bringing Good water for everyone, MTN WTR Co introduces consumers to a uniquely soft and crisp water experience rooted in centuries of Japanese heritage. A Legacy Rooted in Japan's Purest Water Sources MTN WTR Co's story begins with Masa Kinemuchi, a native of Japan who spent his childhood immersed in the country's highest-quality water. Coming from a family with a 200-year legacy in rice farming, Masa was taught: If the water is good, the rice, the sake, the land, and the health of the people will all be good. This principle instilled in him a profound respect for water as the essence of life and health. For over two decades, Masa showcased Japan's finest products internationally while questioning why Japanese water—so integral to world-class sushi, ramen, and sake—wasn't enjoyed more broadly around the globe. After settling in the U.S., Masa partnered with water distribution and logistics expert Takashi Nakamura to form MTN WTR Co in 2017. In 2022, they successfully launched MTN WTR nationwide, delivering North America's first taste of Japanese naturally alkaline spring water sourced directly from the slopes of Mt. Fuji. Key Highlights of MTN WTR Soft & Delicate Flavor As a naturally soft water, MTN WTR provides a more subtle taste that pairs effortlessly with a variety of foods, mixes beautifully in cocktails, and can be enjoyed all on its own. Sourced from Mt. Fuji, Japan Filtered for 50 years through volcanic rock in the nature-rich village of Narusawa, resulting in a refreshingly clean taste. Uniquely Balanced Alkalinity & TDS By combining a naturally alkaline pH of 8.6 with a low TDS of 70, MTN WTR achieves a softer mouthfeel and a distinctly crisp finish—setting it apart from other waters on the market.

Image: Getty Images/Maskot Shifting applications and infrastructure over to cloud computing services can make life easier in some ways, it doesn't automatically mean you can give up all responsibility for keeping your organisations's data secure. Cloud computing continues to grow at a fantastic rate, even though it's been around for quite some time; the most recent data from tech analyst Gartner shows that the infrastructure as a service market grew more than 40% just last year and it noted that 'cloud-native becomes the primary architecture for modern workloads. Then it's perhaps no surprise that cloud security is the fastest growing segment of the security market, with spending jumping from $595 million in the US in 2020 to $841 million last year, largely because companies are discovering that it's a more complicated topic than they realised. Most businesses use multiple cloud services and cloud providers, a hybrid approach that can support granular security options where vital data is kept close (perhaps in a private cloud) while less sensitive applications run in a public cloud to take advantage of big tech's economies of scale. But the hybrid model also introduces new complications, as every provider will have a slightly different set of security models that cloud customers will need to understand and manage. That takes time and (often elusive) expertise across multiple cloud vendors systems. And it's also a dynamic environment; applications and data are often switched between on- and off-premise and between cloud services, all of which are opportunities for errors and data leaks. All of this can extend the enterprise threat surface, while making it harder for organisations to ensure their assets are secured. As a result, misconfigured services are high on the list of root causes for security incidents - along with even more basic failures like poor passwords and identity controls. ZDNET SPECIAL FEATURE: SECURING THE CLOUD According to one recent piece of research half of companies had experienced some kind of cloud security breach in the last 12 months, while almost one in three had been forced to issue a breach notification to a government agency, customer, partner or employees according to the research by Thales. Little surprise that companies are evaluating tools to automate much of this. That's leading to interest in new technologies such as Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools, which can help security teams spot and fix potential security issues around misconfiguration and compliance in the cloud, so they know the same rules are being enforced across their cloud services. Another area of growth has been Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs), which also aim to guarantee that an enterprise's security policies are being enforced across its portfolio of services. Other security technologies that cloud users are interested in, according to industry research, include zero trust and artificial intelligence, and machine learning. However, many technologies that hold out the promise of improving cloud security are still at an early stage. None of this is to say that the cloud is inherently less secure. Indeed, because cloud vendors have the scale to invest in skills and capabilities that are beyond the reach of most customers, cloud services and applications are likely to be more secure than those hosted by companies for whom tech is far from their core competency. But as well as looking at technical innovations it's also worth scrutinising the levels of service and understanding offered by cloud service providers in the first place. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has a good set of general principles for cloud computing security that's worth considering, which can help you judge the security posture of a supplier. There are 14 principles in total, including: Your data should be protected against tampering and eavesdropping as it transits networks inside and external to the cloud. A malicious or compromised customer of the service should not be able to access or affect the service or data of another. The service needs to be operated and managed securely in order to impede, detect or prevent attacks, using vulnerability management, protective monitoring, configuration and change management. If service provider personnel have access to your data and systems, you need a high degree of confidence in their trustworthiness and the technical measures in place that audit and constrain the actions of those personnel. Cloud services should be designed, developed and deployed in a way that minimises and mitigates threats to their security, including a robust software development lifecycle All external or less-trusted interfaces of the service should be identified and defended appropriately, including external APIs, web consoles and command line interfaces. You should be able to identify security incidents and should have the information necessary to find out how and when they occurred. The service will need to provide you with audit information, and issue security alerts when attempted attacks are detected. Developing the right security posture is hard: some companies worry about sophisticated hacking groups, others struggle to stop staff using '1234' as a password. Covering the fundamentals of security, understanding where the market is going, and asking cloud providers tough questions about their own security, is a good path to follow.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/cloud-computing-security-where-it-is-where-its-going/

Joining in 1996, frontman David Draiman not only changed the face of iconic heavy metal band Disturbed, but its name as well. At the time, the Chicago rockers were calling themselves Brawl, which the Stupify singer thought was silly. With a new moniker and Draiman at the helm, Disturbed forged their path in the heavy metal world, selling more than 17 million records across the globe. Unfortunately, the band's latest hometown show resulted in major damage to a valuable piece of Windy City history. Videos by American Songwriter Some Chicagoans Are Calling to Ban Disturbed From the City Disturbed took over Chicago's United Arena last Saturday (March 8) with Sevendust and Three Days Grace for their The Sickness 25th anniversary tour. As usual, the band brought some impressive pyrotechnics—which unfortunately reached the Bulls' six NBA championship banners hanging from the rafters. According to a March 14 report from the Chicago Tribune, United Center staff discovered extensive damage to the fabric of six banners hanging commemorating the Bulls' incredible championship runs from Michael Jordan's heyday in the '90s. Sources told the Tribune that the damage stemmed from Disturbed's March 8 set. In a statement, a spokesperson for the United Center said that the banners will not return this season. However, the venue is currently working with the Bulls to explore options to repair these banners, and we do anticipate them being back in place next season. Predictably, some Chicagoans were not happy, with one social media user calling for the group's lifetime ban from the city of Chicago. Absolute blasphemy! they wrote.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he's kicking out the new Ambassador from South Africa — accusing him of hating America and hating Donald Trump. It's the latest salvo against South Africa, which has been in the administration's crosshairs since Trump took office in January. In a fiery post on X on Friday, Secretary Rubio called Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool a race baiting politician and said he was considered a persona non grata. Rubio's ire came after Rasool said in an online seminar hosted by a South African think tank that the MAGA movement was partially in response to worries about demographic change and a future when white Americans would no longer be the majority. So in terms of that — the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement — the Make America Great Again movement — as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon, said Rasool. The South African government on Saturday scrambled to contain the fallout, issuing a short, terse statement. Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for the South African president, called the ambassador's expulsion regrettable. We urge all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter, he said. South Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America. Things have been tense between the two allies, after Trump falsely accused the South African government of confiscating land from white farmers and invited white Afrikaners to resettle in the US as refugees. Thirty years since the end of apartheid most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority. The government recently passed a bill aimed at addressing that, but contrary to Trump's claim, no land has been seized. South Africa's government said it was, quote, ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged. Trump also cut all financial aid to South Africa, citing the alleged persecution of the Afrikaners as well as South Africa's genocide case against US ally Israel at the Hague. Rubio snubbed South Africa last month too, by failing to attend the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting. South Africa is the current G20 president but Rubio said he was skipping the event because the summit had DEI and climate change on the agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also opted out of the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Cape Town after the US objected to the themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability. South African-born Trump adviser Elon Musk has also attacked South Africa for what he says are its racist ownership laws, that prevent him from taking his Starlink satellite service to the country unless he meets affirmative action requirements. Ambassador Rasool was South Africa's envoy to the US once before, from 2010 to 2015. When he was a child, Rasool's family was forcibly removed from their home during apartheid when the government declared their suburb a whites only area. He went on to become active in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. In his speech on the webinar that caused Rubio's outrage on Friday, the ambassador said South Africa needed to be cautious and diplomatic in dealing with Trump's administration.

The Voice of America may not live up to its ambitious name for much longer. Michael Abramowitz, the director of VOA, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that he was placed on leave, along with virtually the entire staff of 1,300. The announcement comes one day after President Trump signed an executive order to gut VOA's parent agency. Some of VOA's local-language radio stations have stopped broadcasting news reports and switched over to music to fill the airtime, according to listeners. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Even top editors at VOA have been ordered to stop working, so employees expect the broadcaster's worldwide news coverage to grind to a halt, according to half a dozen sources who spoke with CNN on the condition of anonymity. The Voice of America has been silenced, at least for now, a veteran correspondent said. Voice of America is part of the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), which also runs networks like Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks. Those networks are also on Trump's chopping block, as networks' contracts with the operators have been terminated. While Trump allies argue that the broadcasters are bloated and outdated, advocates say that by dismantling the networks, the United States is ceding the airwaves to China and other world powers, thereby harming American interests abroad. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The United States has been funding international news and current affairs coverage intended for global audiences for decades. Both Republican and Democratic leaders have supported the attempts to promote accurate news — and democratic values — in places that are saturated by foreign propaganda. The agency's mission statement, codified in law, is to inform, engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democracy. But the Trump administration has different expectations. An internal memo earlier this month said the mission is to clearly and effectively present the policies of the Trump Administration around the world. Trump appointed conservative media critic Brent Bozell III to run the parent agency and tapped election-denying former TV anchor Kari Lake to run VOA. Bozell's Senate confirmation hearing is months away, with Lake serving as a senior adviser. Lake signed some of the emails announcing Saturday's cuts. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Lake tweeted that the dismantling was taking effect because the president has issued an Executive Order titled Continuing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy. Trump's order said affected agencies should stop performing all work that is not statutorily mandated, and do the rest with as few people as possible. The order was in line with Elon Musk's declaration in February that government-funded international broadcasters should be shut down altogether. Nobody listens to them anymore, Musk posted on X. It's just radical left crazy people talking to themselves while torching $1B/year of US taxpayer money. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advocates for the outlets strongly disagree, pointing to the broadcasters as a bulwark for democracy. Those voices include Republican lawmakers. Gutting Radio Free Asia and other U.S. Agency for Global Media platforms counters the principles of freedom our nation was founded on and cedes leverage to the Chinese Communist Party, North Korea and other regimes, Rep. Young Kim, a California Republican who chairs the House Select Committee on East Asia and Pacific, told Politico last week. It is unclear what will happen next to the USAGM's various platforms. In addition to the employees who were put on leave Saturday, some contractors who were working for VOA were told to hand in their badges. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Other staffers went to VOA offices on Saturday to gather their belongings because they feared being locked out altogether, sources said. But in a recent memo, before Trump signed his order, Lake made it sound like the broadcasters will continue to exist in some fashion going forward. It is critical we recognize our agency is funded by hardworking American taxpayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet, Lake wrote earlier this month. That means we have an added responsibility to restore their trust while working efficiently and honestly to cover this consequential moment in our nation's history. Lake said she would modernize the agency into something the American people are willing to support. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Abramowitz said in his Facebook post that VOA needs thoughtful reform, and we have made progress in that regard, but sidelining the staff means that VOA won't be able to carry out its mission. That mission is especially critical today, he wrote, when America's adversaries, like Iran, China, and Russia, are sinking billions of dollars into creating false narratives to discredit the United States. The American Foreign Service Association released a statement Saturday that it will mount a vigorous defense of USAGM and the Foreign Service professionals whose expertise is indispensable to its mission.

It's time to take a look at those layered films you might not get the first time, and therefore demand multiple viewings… Cinema is a beautiful thing and depending on your mood, there is every kind of film out there to give you what you need. Some films hit every mark on the first viewing and leave you satisfied that you've understood the film and there's nothing more to glean from it. If you watch Commando, you know that you've 'got it.' Schwarzenegger takes out the baddies as he sets about rescuing his kidnapped daughter whilst firing off zingers and destroying as much mise-en-scene as possible. There are no hidden layers or subtext to Commando, beyond the sweaty 80s homoeroticism I suppose. That's not to say that a film that could be easily consumed as surface entertainment can't be viewed repeatedly. Lord knows I've seen Commando at least 30 times, but there are films that have levels below the surface. Films with subtext and/or intricacies in their construction which means an audience could conceivably watch it multiple times and pick up new subtleties with every viewing. It can be a dangerous game for filmmakers too, because there have been a number of films that almost wilfully defy surface-level entertainment in favour of the subtext beneath. David Lynch has often made films in his own inimitable quirky fashion to weed out those who will leave the first viewing scratching their head, but leaving enough intrigue and hidden information to lure back the viewers tuned into his frequency. It's one of the greatest skills in cinema, to make a film that might deliver an initial indifference or even derision that still leaves enough to compel a viewer to return and even more to potentially fall in love with unearthing more and more new layers each time. Here are a few… The Master Paul Thomas Anderson is a master craftsman and he set himself an enormously high bar with There Will Be Blood. He's a filmmaker who is no stranger to creating illusive works with plenty of depth and Magnolia is certainly a film that benefits from repeat viewings. There Will Be Blood certainly has a rich underbelly but it's also a grandiose character study set in a very distinct era of American history. Audiences were left in no doubt of the film's brilliance, already allured by the barnstorming performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. It was hard not to walk out already feeling like you'd just seen a modern masterpiece. So five years later, Anderson's long-awaited follow-up had all the hallmarks of a director riding his biggest moment. He could do and make anything and he made The Master. It's a film that compels you to stay at arm's length with meandering spells and a feeling of occasionally cobbled vignettes. There were similar traits with Inherent Vice which followed, but that was deliberately scattershot, quirky and trippy. The Master takes on cults and modern-era religions with a very direct inspiration coming from L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology. The complexity of Joaquin Phoenix's protagonist, Freddie is enough of a canvas for him to paint his greatest performance. It's a performance that makes his turn as the Joker look two-dimensional (and that in itself was an exceptional performance). However, the film is given even more weight thanks to the Hubbard-esque, Lancaster Dodd, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Anderson beautifully slow-cooks a relationship that bounces across several complicated and contrasting feelings. To each the other is an enigma they're compelled to solve, hate and perhaps even love. It's not that the film has narrative subplots or a huge amount of allegory seeded deep beneath topsoil but, it's the depth of the characters that compels you to revisit and there's a feeling of ambiguity by the end of the picture that has seen this film regarded by many cinephiles as perhaps Anderson's greatest (and most beguiling) work, akin to a stealth jet. Yet as much as it has progressively grown on people through multiple viewings, its inaccessibility (at least in comparison to Boogie Nights or Punch Drunk Love) proved to be a turnoff to some. To pull off wilful evasiveness and to leave so much unanswered is ballsy, to say the least, yet it's something that fails an artist more often than allows them to succeed. Anderson nails it. Decision To Leave Park Chan-wook has quite the CV, filled with an eclectic range of genres but often a very direct and evocative approach to storytelling. Violence is unforgettable and sensuality dazzling in the world of Chan-wook. His films often fire out the traps with either straightforward narratives or those that are full of impactful twists, turns and shocks. J.S.A (Joint Security Area) was a thrilling whodunnit of a murder committed in no man's land between North and South Korea. Twists, turns and a little diarise on cross-border dynamics. But it's a film largely set out to surprise and entertain the audience on their first go. For the most part, everything is nicely tied up at the end. The same can be said of the Vengeance trilogy and the repeat value of Oldboy as an example is to experience that breathtaking intrigue and the punctuations of violence once again. When Decision to Leave arrived last year it left audiences more than a little surprised. For Chan-wook it was a complete change of pace. This wasn't a film with love beads (The Handmaiden), oner action scenes in corridors (Oldboy) or unforgettable exactions of revenge (Lady Vengeance), this was a slow-burning tale of intrigue and the connection between a cop and the wife and chief suspect or an executive who may have been murdered. The film as well as a very clear allegorical underbelly has the feeling of a folk tale about forbidden love. The patience Chan-wook exercises in telling his story and the absolute precision in his shot choices (right down to his use of focus in two shots) and editing show a whole new side only previously hinted at in his other astounding works. It's like when Scorsese, a true master of the art by the time he hit 40, known for intense largely crime-centric films (and a musical to be fair) went and made After Hours as a total about-turn, that still maintained the master's hand. Chan-wook likewise crafts a brooding, forbidden romance that never becomes sexual (and he's never been shy of shooting explicit sex scenes) with all the attention to detail as usual and totally enthralling. A key theme is the mountains vs the sea with the detective (Hae il Park) and suspect Seo Rae (Tang Wei) representing the two and becoming enamoured and drawn to the other. Although it's not deeply hidden by Chan-wook, the distinct visual clues are often eye-catching when broad but likewise, those more carefully hidden signifiers are the kind you pick up by the second viewing and beyond. The pace and look of bombastic moments did alienate some of his fans, but looking deeper into the film proved rewarding for many and ultimately, it might just be his crowning achievement. There's so much to unpick when you revisit this one. With incredible performances, but Tang Wei in particular is utterly mesmerising. Burning Whilst we're in South Korea it would be remiss not to mention Lee Chang-dong's Burning. It's probably my favourite film of the past decade. This doesn't do spectacle or bombast of any kind and even compared to the aforementioned Decision to Leave, Burning really is a slow 'burning' film. This is a mystery that subs tension and twists for ambiguity. When the core mystery centres around the disappearance of a woman, it takes some cahoonas to have that happen halfway into a two-and-a-half-hour movie but herein lies the genius of Chang-dong. The film sees Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in) reconnecting with childhood friend/neighbour Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo) and quickly establishing the personality of both (most importantly, Hae-mi's perpetual search for meaning and erratic behaviour). They sleep together. Then, after she leaves for a trip to Africa, Jong-su sits a cat that never shows itself in her apartment, Hae-mi returns from her trip with the wealthy Ben (Steven Yeun). The third act, as Jong-su searches for answers to the whereabouts/fate of Hae-mi is as much about his fragmentation as her outcome, whilst Yeun's exceptional performance maintains a cryptic facade for Ben. Somehow, Chang-dong can lead us into one theory on the film, whilst laying out conflicting yet feasible information about other theories. It's a complex web of subtle clues, often elements that are told by visual clues rather than dialogue. It's a film with numerous scenes of characters saying one thing but meaning something else entirely. My first viewing though? I wasn't enamoured, that's for sure, feeling a sense of indifference and even frustration as the credits rolled but by the following morning, I'd been up most of the night thinking about the film. I thought about it for a week after and then I rewatched it. Like many films on this list, it also has a plethora of YouTube explainers and theory videos that you may or may not buy into. Clearly, though, it's a film which inspires analysis and repeat viewings, with theories on the three central characters, the underlying comments on class and more. It's so brilliant, the one overriding mystery I still haven't solved is just how Chang-dong pulled off this feat. The Shining Look, The Shining is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of film. Always has been, and always will be, even if the proportion of those who love it is substantially higher than those who don't and thus it often ranks in the upper echelons of greatest horror lists. The film's brilliance is such that even Stephen King has somewhat warmed to a film he vocally bashed back in the day (as despite being based on his book, it's decidedly more a Kubrick tale than King). The film usually gets its fans on the first go, because despite its unconventional approach to the genre, the imagery is so memorable, and the film so unsettling that it instantly digs its claws in. What invites so many repeat visits and so much analysis is the playful ambiguity that Kubrick injects. As a concept, 'the shining' itself is an unseen entity that's only vaguely explained, on top of a ghost story that is sprinkled in but never to any great clarity, leaving much to the audience's interpretation. In Halloween, we know who the bad guy is, and what he's after and though there's some mystery, it's a singular and simple story. Kubrick, as he did with 2001: A Space Odyssey lays out a number of ideas and hides coded messages and visual clues in plain sight. This film has had more theories, breakdowns and in-depth analysis than any in cinema history. YouTube is chock full (check out Rob Ager's Collative Learning channel in particular for some of the best) of them and even the more hare-brained are compelling. The notorious documentary, Room 237 dived into some of the wilder conspiracies and theories associated with The Shining. One thing is for sure, with so many theories out there from the theory of seven, 42, the overlook being a CIA experiment or being a depiction of hell, or the film being Kubrick's admission of faking the moon landing, there's plenty for fans to look into and enjoy. The Matrix When it came to The Matrix, fans signed up for the visionary special FX, kung-fu fights and balletic gun battles. They came back for those certainly but were also allured by the philosophy and religious references littered throughout the film as well as the existential questions that have been associated with many great sci-fi works. The Matrix is the original internet super fandom film, a work of rare pop cultural impact. For a good decade after its release, the film spawned limitless websites devoted to excavating every reference, and allegory and constructing as many theories as possible. It was a key time for movie fans, even down to the level of casual, wanting to look deeper into a film. Although the internet's fascination with film analysis has certainly grown since then, by the same token it's become a little more niche in general, focused on cinephiles who want to explore the depths of a particular film. As such this generation of casuals is just more inclined to consume and dispose of the array of disposable films churned out before them and The Matrix doesn't have quite the same spread as it once did, confined (much like other mere mortal films) to the eyes of the cinephile. New casual movie-watching fans begin and end their fascination with the action and aesthetics. Mirror Pick a Tarkovsky, any Tarkovsky! If you're talking films which need to be given due diligence and watched several times, then Andrei Tarkovsky might just be the master. For him, cinema isn't merely about narrative or telling conventional stories. It's about the audience experiencing and feeling the film before them. Going into one of Tarkovsky's works is to give yourself over to the immersion and make peace with the ambiguity. In Mirror, his most personal work, it's a life story set out with the feeling of a dream. It's vivid, full of intoxicating imagery and powerful moments but with unreliable structure and narration (one character appears in the guise of the unseen protagonist's ex-wife and mother, which will confuse most on first viewing). It's unlike anything you'll ever see as it portrays the reminiscence of a dying man looking back over his life, the idolisation of his mother and the history he lived through. It mixes memories with dreams and despite the narrative jumps within the film it tends to leave a stamp on most viewers. The beauty of Mirror, maybe more than even Stalker (my favourite AT film) and Solaris, is that audiences continually return to try to piece the puzzle together, but arguably lose sight of the film's greatest gift being its drifting, dreamlike ambiguity as well as how authentic it is to its creator.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/films-that-demand-multiple-viewings/
President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday put journalists at Voice of America and other US-funded broadcasters on leave, abruptly freezing outlets long seen as critical to countering a Russian and Chinese information offensive. Hundreds of reporters and other staff at VOA, Radio Free Asia, Radio Free Europe and other outlets received a weekend email saying they will be barred from their offices and should surrender press passes, office-issued telephones and other equipment. Trump, who has already eviscerated the US aid agency and Education Department, on Friday issued an executive order listing the US Agency for Global Media as among elements of the federal bureaucracy that the president has determined are unnecessary. Kari Lake, a firebrand Trump supporter and former Arizona news anchor who was put in charge of the media agency after she lost a US Senate bid, wrote -- in an email to media outlets she supervises -- that federal grant money no longer effectuates agency priorities. A White House press official, Harrison Fields, took a much less legalistic tone in a post on X, simply writing goodbye in 20 languages, a sarcastic jab at VOA's multilingual coverage. The head of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which started broadcasting into the Soviet bloc during the Cold War, called the cancellation of funding a massive gift to America's enemies. - Gift to China? - The Iranian ayatollahs, Chinese communist leaders, and autocrats in Moscow and Minsk would celebrate the demise of RFE/RL after 75 years, its president, Stephen Capus, said in a statement. Handing our adversaries a win would make them stronger and America weaker, he said. US-funded media have reoriented themselves since the end of the Cold War, dropping much of the programming geared toward newly democratic Central and Eastern European countries and focusing on Russia and China. Radio Free Asia, established in 1996, sees its mission as providing uncensored reporting into countries without free media including China, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam. The outlets have an editorial firewall, with a stated guarantee of independence despite the funding from the US government. The policy has angered some around Trump, who has long railed against media and in his first stint in office had suggested that US government-funded outlets should promote his policies. sct/dc|2025-03-16|https://www.youralaskalink.com/news/national/trump-freezes-voa-radio-free-asia-radio-free-europe/article_9ce06aac-50d8-5921-a54a-1c6a7502176d.html
California homeowners are facing a 22% increase in insurance premiums if State Farm, the state's largest single insurer with roughly 1 million home insurance policies in California, can justify it with data in a public hearing next month, California's top insurance regulator said Friday, reports the Los Angeles Times. State Farm claims it is committed to its California customers and aims to restore financial stability. I expect both State Farm and its parent company to meet their responsibilities and not shift the burden entirely onto their customers, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. The facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Casey Chong looks at seven of the best horror threequels… Horror franchises tend to be erratic even for iconic ones like Halloween and Friday the 13th. The first film is often seen as a high point that's hard to top, let alone replicate in the subsequent follow-ups (i.e. John Carpenter's Halloween and Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street). But that doesn't mean all follow-ups are inferior as there are certainly worthwhile entries and here we'll be talking about the best threequels (that would be the third film in the series) as we celebrate the arrival of Terrifier 3. Check out our picks below… Friday the 13th Part III (1982) Steve Miner, who previously directed Friday the 13th Part 2, returns for the second time in this immediate follow-up. Likewise, in keeping the tradition of Friday the 13th franchise, it's all about the trifecta of must-have elements: gratuitous violence, sex & nudity and creative kills. Miner fulfills them, showcasing his directorial flair for building up dread and tension for the first 15 minutes alone, detailing the death of a middle-aged couple. Friday the 13th Part III introduces a new group of teenagers and that means fresh meat for Jason Voorhees' continuous killing spree. There are a few good kills, even going overboard and more so if you manage to watch this in 3D in cinemas back in the day or the Blu-ray Deluxe Edition. The most memorable kill? That would be the scene where Jason squeezes one of his victims' temples so hard his eyeballs popped out of the socket (!) Miner also slapped in some goofy elements, courtesy of Larry Zerner's (Shelly Finkelstein) comic-relief character who loves to prank one of his friends, Vera (Catherine Parks). Not to forget, the pivotal moment where Jason finally ditches the burlap sack in favor of Larry's hockey mask covering his disfigured face. Friday the 13th Part III also benefits from Harry Manfredini and Michael Zager's riveting Jaws-like score. Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) A Halloween movie without the iconic Michael Myers? Or even connected to Laurie Strode? That's blasphemy to the franchise, especially given the establishment of the first two movies. Written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, Halloween III: Season of the Witch totally subverts fans and audiences' expectations at the time with a completely different story. It was more of a standalone entry, detailing the Twilight Zone-style plot of a mad owner of the Silver Shamrock Novelties company Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy, who would appear in RoboCop five years later) plotting to brainwash every child in America with microchips implanted in his rubber Halloween masks. Upon the first viewing at the time, it sure feels like the franchise had betrayed its fans. Still, subsequent reassessments proved otherwise, beginning with Dan O'Herlihy's creepy antagonist turn as the diabolical Conal Cochran. The combined elements of witchcraft and black magic with a dash of sci-fi works well in Wallace's intended direction and storytelling favor, resulting in an eerie and macabre horror explores the dark sides of capitalism and consumerism. A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987) After the less-than-stellar 1985 sequel, A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors marks a return to form for the franchise. Of course, the 1984 original remains unsurpassed but the third entry is no slouch either. Then-rookie director Chuck Russell may have been a newcomer in his debut feature but he shows plenty of creativity in visual effects and set pieces. From the giant, slimy slug-like Freddy (Robert Englund) storming out of a carpeted floor trying to swallow Kristen Parker's (Patricia Arquette, whose screams tend to sound deafening) whole to Freddy controlling Phillip Anderson's (Bradley Gregg) exposed veins like a marionette doll, the movie packs with lots of iconic funhouse-type horror moments. Personally, the best one goes to Jennifer Caulfield's (Penelope Sudrow) brutal death after Freddy's head emerges from the top of a wall-mounted TV, complete with mechanical arms protruding on both sides before thrusting her head through the screen. That scene alone effectively combines the macabre horror and pitch-black, tongue-in-cheek humor ( This is it, Jennifer. Your big break in TV. Welcome to prime time, bitch! ). The story, which predominantly takes place in the confines of a psychiatric hospital, allows Russell to turn the setting into a visual playground. The third entry even brings back two of the original stars, Heather Lagenkamp's Nancy Thompson, and John Saxon's Officer Donald Thompson. Their returns could have easily succumbed to mere fan service, especially under the hands of a lesser director. But Russell, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Wes Craven, justifies their appearances that proved to be integral to the story. The Exorcist III (1990) The laughably absurd Exorcist II: The Heretic sure felt like a final nail in the coffin, resulting in one of the worst sequels – horror or not – ever made. William Peter Blatty, the author himself whose 1971 book The Exorcist became the source of William Friedkin's inspiration, returns for The Exorcist III. Only this time, he served as both screenwriter and director adapted from his own Legion novel. It marks his second and final feature film after the underrated genre-bending existential drama The Ninth Configuration ten years prior, Blatty opts for the slow-burn dread, favoring methodical direction in telling his story of a police lieutenant (a perfectly grizzled George C. Scott) investigating a series of Gemini Killer-style murders. The Exorcist III features the return of Jason Miller's Father Karras from the first movie and Brad Dourif's creepy supporting turn while Blatty stages some genuine scares (the creepy old woman crawling on the ceiling above George C. Scott's Lt. William F. Kinderman comes to mind). Then, there's the elaborate hospital scene where Blatty skillfully incorporates static shots, long takes and the power of silence which ends with one of the best jump scares ever seen in a horror movie. Army of Darkness (1992) Sam Raimi's first two Evil Dead movies resulted in memorable horror classics, thanks to the director's unique blend of over-the-top violence and dark humor. His Evil Dead II was particularly a step-up to the already-genre-defining original and the anticipation was high for the third movie, especially after its promising finale in the sequel. But Army of Darkness is somewhat of an anomaly as Raimi diverts from the previous movies' single-location setting (the remote cabin, that is) to a… Medieval-era fantasy-comedy-horror hybrid. The third entry even significantly toned down the extreme gore and violence that defined the first two movies. And yet, Raimi's radical change of direction manages to work like a charm. He successfully infuses slapstick horror and Three Stooges-like comedy while the Ray Harryhausen-style fantasy elements, particularly the appearance of a reanimated skeleton army packed with enough outrageous fun and quirky moments. Then, there's Bruce Campell with his go-for-broke Ash character delivers one of his most entertaining and funniest performances to date, complete with endlessly quotable dialogues ( Shop smart. Shop S-Mart! You got that? ). Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead (1994) Don Coscarelli, the man behind the innovative Phantasm back in 1979 was renowned for the imposingly lanky Angus Scrimm as The Tall Man, the flying silver sphere capable of drilling its victim's brain, and the fever-dream storytelling that inspired many movies, notably Wes Craven's A Nightmare on Elm Street. But the 1988 sequel was surprisingly dull and laborious and thankfully, Coscarelli returns with a vengeance in Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead. The third entry has Angus Scrimm reprising his iconic role and remains as formidable as ever while Coscarelli packs his movie with offbeat characters, notably the horny Reggie (Reggie Bannister) and Rambo-style Rocky (Gloria Lynne Henry), resulting in some comedic and entertaining chemistry between the two. Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead amps up the wickedly fun horror vibes with some creative gore effects and even a spectacular stunt work revolving around a hearse crash. Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) The found-footage horror subgenre may have been overplayed by the time Paranormal Activity 3 arrived in cinemas in 2011. But Catfish co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman manage to find fresh angles in reanimating the franchise by letting loose a little rather than sticking to the first two movies' formulaic structure. They add comic relief within the franchise's familiar false-alarm jump scares and some creative moments, notably the fan-mounted camera. It was an ingenious move since the oscillating fan allows the camera to pan left and right and vice versa, making you wonder if there's something sinister about to happen or make you jump. Paranormal Activity 3 also features some remarkably tension-filled moments during the second half of the movie from the Bloody Mary game in the bathroom to the Poltergeist-inspired kitchen set piece.

Lead testing clinic at Bradley Tech High School article MILWAUKEE - The Milwaukee Health Department said more school closures are possible as it tries to understand the scope of students exposed to lead at Milwaukee Public Schools. A testing clinic on Saturday hoped to drill down who has been exposed and where. What they're saying: School was out, but the doors at Bradley Tech High School were open to MPS families to register and get students' blood tested for lead. I wanted to make sure that they got that routine screening done, said Ashanti Dean, whose children attend Maryland Avenue Montessori School. One, because they do attend the school. And two, because they are young and at risk for those factors related to lead poisoning. Children's Wisconsin helped set up the testing clinic to provide children with access to lead testing. This is accelerating a process that's been in place for a long time, said Dr. Mike Gutzeit, Children's Wisconsin primary care president. Lead testing clinic at Bradley Tech High School For Dean, it means peace of mind. We made it through just fine, she said. I wanted to catch it early, so we could get interventions implemented if needed. By the numbers: The Milwaukee Health Department said 251 children were tested at Saturday's clinic. What's next: While test results are immediate, it will take the health department time to drill down if lead exposure came from a home or from an MPS school. If all of the children that we screen from one classroom, from one school, are all testing positive, that would give us an indication to look more closely at that particular classroom or school, Totoraitis said. The health department anticipates holding additional lead testing events like Saturday's to gain a fuller picture of the risks MPS students face. Details can be found on MHD's website. MPS school closures The backstory: The testing clinic came just days after the Milwaukee Health Department and MPS announced three more schools would close on Monday for lead remediation. The total number of impacted schools has now reached seven. Students at Fernwood Montessori, Starms Early Childhood and LaFollette schools will temporarily relocate to other schools to continue learning. No students at those schools had high blood lead levels, but the buildings were among the 10 that health officials visually inspected this week. If additional schools that are deemed to be hazardous for students to be in there, we will make those decisions with the district, said Mike Totoraitis, the city's health commissioner. Related MPS lead hazards: EPA, CDC help requested for investigations / MPS lead hazards: EPA, CDC help requested for investigations / The Milwaukee Public Schools lead problem continues to grow as three more schools will shut their doors on Monday, March 17. Dig deeper: MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius officially started the job on Saturday. She takes the helm of a school district that is navigating the addition of school resource officers and a financial data reporting crisis on top of, now, lead hazards in schools. What a great example of the community pulling together. It gives me such great hope starting on my very first day, said MPS Superintendent Brenda Cassellius. How to limit exposure What you can do: Health officials said wet dusting and mopping at home at least twice a week can minimize the risk of lead exposure. Children should wash their hands with soap and water, especially before meals and after play. Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) If you have or suspect you may have lead pipes, run faucets on cold for three minutes before using water for drinking or cooking. Residents should also cover or block lead hazards, like chipping paint, and keep children away from those areas. Diets rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C can help reduce lead absorption, the health department said. For questions related to lead exposure, MPS families can contact Health Services Manager Tashanda Edelen at 414-438-3539. For additional resources and educational materials, as well as general information on how to keep your child and home lead-safe, visit the Milwaukee Health Department's website, or call the MHD Lead Program at 414-286-2165.

43-year-old Thomas Griffin of Lake Wales was arrested by PCSO deputies this morning, June 22, 2017, after he had an altercation with a 17-year-old boy, concerning Griffin's daughter. Thomas Griffin is a teacher at Lake Region High School in Winter Haven. The following is an excerpt from the affidavit, and is self-explanatory: On 06-22-2017 the suspect, Thomas Griffin, discovered that his daughter was not inside of his residence, therefore he checked the GPS location of her cellphone to discover she was in the area of a mobile home park on North Scenic Hwy in Lake Wales. The suspect recognized this location as an area where he had dropped her off to visit with friends a few weeks prior, therefore he responded to the same location to find his daughter. Upon arrival at the residence the suspect damaged the front porch gate, breaking all three hinges, preventing the gate from being opened, closed, secured, or to function as it is designed to do. Upon arriving at the front door of the residence, the suspect opened the screen door and knocked on the interior door. The victim, who is seventeen years old, asked who was at the door. The suspect advised it was …'s dad, therefore the victim opened the front door. When the victim opened the front door the suspect entered the residence, uninvited, and began asking where his daughter was. While inside the residence his daughter was located, at which time he instructed her to go outside to his vehicle. While still inside the house, the suspect grabbed the seventeen year old victim by the throat, threw him on the couch and stated if he goes near his daughter again he is going to kill the victim. The suspect then fled the scene. Deputies located Griffin later that morning, and booked him into the Polk County Jail for one count burglary with assault (F-1) and one count criminal mischief (M-2).

Steve Grace and Kirra Daley's Beachtree Distillery is among Australia's most awarded. Photo: HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY Steve Grace and Kirra Daley's Beachtree Distillery is among Australia's most awarded. Photo: HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY It was a conversation over a few drinks that sparked the inception of Beachtree Distillery and owners Kirra Daley and Steve Grace to take the leap from their day jobs to business owners. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading Standing proudly in Caloundra, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, the organic distillery is now among Australia's most awarded. But the story of the First Nations-owned business begins well before the conversation that set the plans in motion. Ms Daley's father is a farmer, particularly interested in native plants, while her mother made sure to connect her to her Italian roots through winemaking and distilling. These traditions, combined with local, organic ingredients became a core passion. I was taught growing up that when you have a native it should be pure, you don't want to mix up chemicals or preservatives and things like that, the Bundjalung woman told AAP. Mr Grace's passion began with playing around with native ingredients out bush . With a background in engineering distilling equipment and using a process that is unique, the Kamilaroi man admits he's a perfectionist with each batch. I am very passionate about it, says the master distiller. The end result? It's me, it's mine and it represents me and us. I believe it has to be perfect. Beachtree brings together the pair's long-held passions for their traditions and love of ingredients from Australian soil. Even the name Beachtree is inspired by its location and the history that goes with it. The meaning of Caloundra in the local Kabi Kabi language is 'place of beech trees', so Beachtree is a nod to those roots. Each bottle adds to the distillery's story and pays homage to the past. I bring the influence of a 65,000 year heritage, Mr Grace said. Without the ancestors backing me, I wouldn't be able to do what I do. Master distiller Steve Grace is a self-described perfectionist. (HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY) Master distiller Steve Grace is a self-described perfectionist. (HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY) Over the years Ms Daley said she's learned to trust the master distiller's instincts. With a number of his handcrafted drops winning gold at the World Gin Awards, World Wine and Spirits competition and World Vodka Awards, Mr Grace has certainly earned this trust. Beachtree was also named craft producer of the year at the 2024 Icons of Gin Awards. But the journey hasn't always been easy for the small First Nations-owned business in a tough industry . The pair established Beachtree in 2020, with Ms Daley describing what came next as a rollercoaster , with COVID-19 lockdowns and 2022 floods disrupting the operation. They invested everything in the business, staying with family while the distillery found its feet. Sometimes I look back on those moments and think, 'what was I thinking', she said. But if we hadn't done it ... we'd probably be sitting there going 'what would have happened if we'd started that business we talked about over drinks'. The only way we're going to know how this pans out is if we just continue the journey and see where it takes us.|2025-03-16|https://www.redlandcitybulletin.com.au/story/8917728/an-indigenous-owned-distillery-born-over-a-few-drinks/?cs=30776

Tim Tebow, wife expecting baby girl, choose Bible verse to 'speak over' her By Ryan Foley, Christian Post Reporter Friday, March 07, 2025 Tim and Demi-Leigh Tebow hug after finding out they are going to have a girl in March 2025. / Instagram/Demi-Leigh Tebow Former professional football player Tim Tebow and his wife Demi-Leigh are expecting a baby girl and they plan to include a Bible verse in her nursery to speak over her. In an Instagram post Wednesday, Demi-Leigh Tebow announced that the couple would release the results of a gender reveal for their unborn child the following day. Black and white images accompanying the post showed the couple painting a canvas while blindfolded after paintbrushes were placed in either blue or pink paint to represent either a boy or a girl, respectively. A video posted by Demi-Leigh Tebow Thursday began in color with the couple standing in front of a blank canvas and offering their final predictions as to whether their child would be a boy or a girl. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Demi-Leigh Tebow insisted that she had thought it was a girl this whole time while stressing that she would be happy either way. Tim Tebow indicated that he agreed their first child would be a girl. The Tebows declared in a caption accompanying the video that To create a meaningful piece of art for the nursery, we decided to find out the gender through painting! We chose two Bible verses — one for a boy and one for a girl — to add to the canvas once it was complete, she wrote. The video transformed into black and white as it showed the couple placing blindfolds on each other and painting on the canvas. After taking the blindfolds off, the couple held hands and kept their eyes closed as a person off-camera counted down. When the countdown was complete, the video transitioned into color and revealed pink paint on the canvas, meaning the couple will have a baby girl. Demi-Leigh Tebow shared Psalm 25:4-5 as the Bible verse they want to speak over their baby girl. The Scripture states, Show me your ways, Lord, teach me your paths. Guide me in your truth and teach me, for you are God my savior, and my hope is in you all day long. The post described their unborn baby girl as their greatest blessing, adding, We've been praying for her long before we knew her, and we're beyond grateful that God chose us to be her parents. We pray that she always finds her identity in Christ and places her hope in His love and truth. Now, let's get this nursery in order! Bring on the pink bows, ruffles, and all things sweet, the post concluded. The Tebows announced they were expecting their first child in January, five years after they were married in Demi-Leigh Tebow's home country of South Africa. While she is a former Miss Universe, Tim Tebow has developed a reputation as one of the world's most popular Christian athletes, who regularly professed his faith both on and off the field. Tebow has received national attention for his faith dating back to his days as a college football player at the University of Florida and is the brainchild of the annual Night to Shine events to give teenagers with special needs a prom-like experience. More recently, Tebow has emerged as an advocate against human trafficking. Last year, he appeared at a press conference unveiling bipartisan legislation titled The Renewed Hope Act of 2024, which sought to make it easier for federal law enforcement officials to rescue trafficking victims and identify predators.

Staff Reporter Ponda Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said that Shigmo and Carnival are unique traditions in India and play a significant role in enhancing Goa's happiness index. He was speaking at the launch of the statewide Shigmotsav celebrations in Ponda on Saturday. The parade was organised by the Ponda Shigmotsav Samiti in association with the Tourism Department. Tourism Minister Rohan Khaunte, Agriculture Minister Ravi Naik, BJP state president Damu Naik, and others were present. Sawant said the government-organised Shigmotsav is one of the best examples of integrating tradition with sustainable tourism. Shigmo has been transformed into a tourism event, providing a grand platform to showcase local artistes and traditional art forms across the state. Although the prize money offered does not fully cover the expenses incurred by the participating groups, the government is making efforts to promote these events, which set Goa apart from the rest. Goa's Shigmo is often compared to Maharashtra's, but our celebrations are unique and far superior. This form of Shigmo is celebrated only in Goa, he said. He added that international tourists are now visiting the state to experience Shigmo, in addition to domestic travellers. Khaunte said the government is focussing on regenerative tourism, highlighting local traditions and village-level events to attract tourists to Goa's hinterland. He added that the tourism event calendar is regularly updated, with festivals like Shigmo receiving special attention. Ponda town witnessed a spectacular display of Romtamel, folk dances and floats. A massive crowd gathered as the town reverberated with the sounds of dhol and tashe. This year's Ponda Shigmo featured 32 tableaus, 16 Romtamel groups, 11 folk dance groups, and over 70 fancy dress participants.|2025-03-16|https://www.navhindtimes.in/2025/03/16/goanews/shigmo-carnival-festivals-boost-goas-happiness-index-sawant/

Here's what you need to know about St. Patrick's Day The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. FILE - A person waves an Irish flag while watching the St. Patrick's Day parade, Sunday, March 17, 2024, in Boston's South Boston neighborhood. Credit: Steven Senne, File, AP NEW YORK — If it's March, and it's green, it must be St. Patrick's Day. The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. And nowhere is that more so than in the United States, where parades take place in cities around the country and all kinds of foods and drinks are given an emerald hue. In fact, it was among Irish American communities that the day became the celebration it is, from its roots as a more solemn day with a religious observance in Ireland. But even in America, it was about more than a chance to dye a river green (looking at you, Chicago) or just bust out a favorite piece of green clothing, it was about putting down roots and claiming a piece of the country's calendar. Who is St. Patrick and why does he even have a day? Patrick was not actually Irish, according to experts. Born in the late fourth century, he was captured as an adolescent and ended up enslaved in Ireland. He escaped to another part of Europe where he was trained as a priest and returned to Ireland in the fifth century to promote the spread of Christianity. Several centuries later, he was made a saint by the Catholic Church and like other saints had a day dedicated to him, which was March 17. He became Ireland's patron saint, and even when religious strife broke out between Catholics and Protestants, was claimed by both, says Mike Cronin, historian and academic director of Boston College Dublin. How did an Irish saint's day become an American thing? The short answer: Irish people came to America and brought their culture with them. St. Patrick's Day observances date back to before the founding of the U.S., in places like Boston and New York City. The first parade was held in Manhattan in 1762. While the day was marked with more of a religious framing and solemnity in Ireland until well into the 20th century, in America it became the cultural and boisterous celebration it is today, marked by plenty of people without a trace of Irish heritage. It was because people in Ireland started seeing how the day was marked in the U.S. that it became more of a festival in the country of its origin rather than strictly a religious observance, Cronin says, pointing to the parades, parties and other festivities that are held. Oh, and by the way, for those who like to shorten names: Use St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day. Paddy is a nickname for Pádraig, which is the Irish spelling of Patrick. The Chicago River is dyed green as part of annual St. Patrick's Day festivities Saturday, March 15, 2025, in Chicago. Credit: Erin Hooley, AP Why is it such a big deal? Holidays aren't simply days to watch bands go by, or wear a specific outfit or costume. Being able to mark a holiday, and have others mark it, is a way of putting down roots, showing that you've made it in American culture, says Leigh Schmidt, professor in the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University. You've made your claim on that American calendar, in American civic life, by having these holidays widely recognized. The spread of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the U.S. was a way for Irish immigrant communities, who in the 19th century faced discrimination and opposition, to stake that ground, he says: It's a kind of immigrant Irish way of combating nativist antagonism against them. What's with four-leaf clovers, anyway? A popular sight around the holiday is the shamrock, or three-leaf clover, linked to Ireland and St. Patrick. The lucky ones, though, come across something that's harder to find: a four-leaf clover. That's because it takes a recessive trait or traits in the clover's genetics for there to be more than the normal 3 leaves, says Vincent Pennetti, who has been fascinated by the plants since high school. Four-leaf clovers are real. They are rare, he says. That doesn't mean they can't be found. People just have to keep their eyes open and get really good at noticing patterns and breaks in the patterns, and they just start jumping out at you, he says. Katie Glerum finds them. She says it's not unheard of for her to be somewhere like out in a park and see one. She usually scoops it up and often gives it to someone else, to a positive response. If it happened every day, then I probably would be less excited about it, she says.

Image: Gil Penalosa. (Courtesy 8-80 Cities) Gil Penalosa is the executive director of 8-80 Cities in Ontario, Canada, which advocates for vibrant and healthy cities. He will be speaking tonight, Tuesday, March 13th at 6:00 p.m. at the Glassworks at 815 West Market Street as part of the Urban Design Studio's Sustainable City Series. Penalosa previously served as Commissioner of Parks in Bogotá, Columbia and helped to initiate many of the city's most innovative programs such as the Ciclovia Open Streets program where a street is closed to auto-traffic on Sundays and opened for use as public space to the larger community. Broken Sidewalk recently spoke with Penalosa about his work in creating better, livable cities and public spaces and how Louisville can benefit from increased attention to public space. After achieving great success in Bogota, how did you end up moving to Canada and establishing 8-80 Cities? I came with my family for a couple of years and we fell in love with Canada and we stayed. I worked for the city for a few years to get more Canadian experience, but a few years ago I created a non-profit 8-80 Cities. With 8-80 Cities, our approach isn't only about walking or cycling or parks or public spaces. Those are just the means. What we really want to do is figure out how to collaborate to create vibrant cities and healthy communities where people are going to be happier enjoying parks and other public places. We focus on advising decision makers—mayors, council members, governors—and community groups. We look at it like a three legged stool, one leg is the elected officials, another is the city staff, and the third leg is the community. If one of them is not in sync, then the stool is not going to be very useful. In Bogotá, one of the projects you started that has caught on around the world is the Ciclovia. One of the things we did was Open Streets. In Bogotá we called it Ciclovia. I have helped many cities and provided advice to cities like Portland, San Francisco, and New York, because I feel it's very successful for cities of any size—50,000 people to 500,000 people to 5 million people—to close the streets to cars and open them to people. In a time of economic recession like now when cities don't have the money to build arenas and gymnasiums and community centers, this is something that doesn't need capital investment. It just needs operational investment. One of the main benefits of Open Streets is that it's an exercise in social integration, bringing together the young and old, rich and poor. One bike might be worth $5,000 and another might be worth $50, but in the end, both cyclists are having just as much fun. The street doesn't have to have the same use 24-7. It can have different uses according to the time of the day, the day of the week, the season of the year. This is something to make people realize that things can change. We have been building cities for over 5,000 years, but it's only the last 60 or 70 that we have been thinking more of car mobility than people's happiness. Those two concepts are incompatible. When we look at Louisville from the air, the biggest public places are the streets, so the biggest discussion, not only now, but ten years from now, is how are we going to use the streets? And by public space I mean the space that belongs to everybody—the young and the old, the rich and the poor. The streets belong to all, so how are we going to use them? How much space are we going to leave for coffee shops and cafes to have tables outside? How much space for pedestrians? How much for cyclists and public transit and cars? How we distribute this space is very important. How do you deal with resistance you might encounter in the community? Sometimes politicians don't want to be pioneers because they think pioneers get shot in the back. There are many cities already doing programs like Ciclovia, so you can look to them for examples. What is the experience of San Francisco or New York or Paris? You have to realize that change never happens by consensus. Change is hard. If you want to have change be unanimous, it will never happen. You'd have to water it down so much that there's no change in it any longer. In order to make a Ciclovia work, for example, you can see in other cities that there's not that much traffic congestion because most people do it on Sundays. It's different than a race or a marathon, because when you do a race, you have to shut down a street. When you do an open street, you don't have to shut down the street completely; the cross streets remain open so you're not isolating different parts of the city. Ciclovias are actually really good for business. In San Francisco, the people who were opposing Open Streets the most came back and realized they were wrong and are asking the mayor to do it every Sunday of the month because on Open Streets days they do more sales. It helps to let businesses talk to businesses in other cities and show them the experience from other cities on what is the perception. But politicians also must have guts and realize that the general interest must prevail over the particular. What other projects can cities explore on a limited budget? We work a lot with under-performing parks. In many parks and public places, cities are willing to invest millions to build them but not the thousands to improve their uses and activities. Successful public places around the world are successful not just because of the design but also because of the management. That's not just cutting the grass and picking up the garbage. The bigger part of management is how to involve the community in the parks. How can we get the religious groups, the neighborhood leaders, the elementary schools and universities into the park so that they actually provide many more benefits. One major difficulty can be finding funding for these uses. Because parks don't have any walls, many people don't think they need any investment. When cities build a community center with walls, immediatey they realize they need customer service, classes and programs, and security. But in the parks, we don't include the same kind of investment. We need to think of parks more as outdoor community centers where we need to invest in uses and activities so they can fulfill their potential. When we improve parks, we're really improving quality of life. You mentioned the importance of programming in parks. Is this also important for events like Open Streets? It is very important. Some people call it Sunday Bikeways but that's the wrong name because it's not about cycling. It's about walking, running, skateboarding, but then some people want more than that. In Guadalajara, probably the best open streets today, we see people doing all kinds of activities from playing with hula-hoops to salsa dancing and tai chi. There's music and other activities. Even free haircuts. Not everyone wants to walk or run or bike. Is there a project you're working on now that serves as a model for a mid-size city like Louisville? I'll be showing hundreds of slides in Louisville of projects in cities that are bigger and smaller, some that are poorer and some that are much wealthier than Louisville, but everything I'm going to show is doable in Louisville as long as people keep an open mind and realize that that this is not like a computer where you copy and paste but rather about how to adapt and improve. A few weeks ago, a councilor from Thunder Bay, a small municipality of 50,000 people in northern Canada, told me about a new park they built in their downtown modeled after one in New York City. They really understood that it's not about copy and paste, but adapting. They picked up the concept of the pilot project. You don't have to do a complete project from the beginning, you can do a pilot. Whatever I show, whether it's how to improve bikeability or walkability, it's going to be directly relevant to Louisville. I want to be useful in showing that we can do this, and we can do it now. We need to break projects into groups of what we can do now and what takes longer. Can we figure out what projects are Impatiens, the projects we can do now—this year—that are low cost and high visibility, and that you don't have to go to the city council for approval. And then what projects are the Orchids, the longer term projects that might need approvals from a company's board of directors or the city council to get them done. Everything is about focusing on doing. We need to move away from just talking and start doing. We don't have time to continue to talk, we need to act. So many cities have been doing study after study after study. They need a different attitude— Ready, Fire, Aim. Now too many cities are Ready, Aim, Aim, Aim and they never fire. At some point you need to realize that you don't have 100 percent of the information, but people never do. You have to realize that you have enough information and we have to move forward.|2025-03-16|https://brokensidewalk.com/2012/qa-gil-penalosa-on-livable-cities/
Land Rover Range Rover IT 730x338 at The Question of Ergonomics Vis à Vis Modern In Car Displays Whether you are a fan or not, the configurable, color-rich, graphics-heavy in-dash touchscreens are here to stay. They have all but replaced the traditional knobs and dials and buttons, affecting not just the way we interact with our cars, but the whole design of the cabin as well. Fair enough. They are the new fad and we have no choice but to go along with them. But the question remains, how ergonomic are these visually impressive screens? In other words, do they make our lives easier or harder? Put bluntly, do the people who design them, actually use them before signing off on them? Some may say that it is a given that new technologies make our lives richer and more fulfilling. But if you look at the history of fads and trends from, say, 1960s forward, there have been many occasions where people picked conforming to a certain trend over personal comfort and convenience. Many different styles of clothing come to mind when one thinks of this, and a great number of astonishing hairdos. We can't help but think that a large part of the public fascination with these touchscreens has to do with just that – the trend. Land Rover Range Rover AC 730x435 at The Question of Ergonomics Vis à Vis Modern In Car Displays Let us illuminate this point with an example. In the latest Range Rover models you have no less than three screens: one acting as a virtual instrument binnacle, one for the infotainment/satellite navigation, and a fairly weird screen that controls the car's climate features. Of these three, we can only make logical sense of just one. The instruments screen, which is fairly configurable and offers various views with maps and stuff is a very handy thing to have. Mind you, even that screen contains some hard to fathom menus that are pretty hard to use while driving. The infotainment screen, located in the middle of the dashboard, is the default screen which is must-have and we do not object to its existence. What we do object to, is the size of the buttons and fonts and icons on this screen. What on earth were the people at Range Rover thinking when they came up with this layout? The Range Rovers of the old used to famously have chunky buttons and levers so that they could be operated by a gloved hand. These new touch-buttons require the delicate and slender fingers of a female pianist to be clicked on first try. And that is while you are stationary. If you want to use them while driving, you also need the vision and focus of a fighter pilot. We reckon Range Rover designers will argue that they had to go with extra small icons and buttons because of all the features integrated into the system. This is the result of a ripple effect, caused by the desire of, we imagine, some market research that said people have all of a sudden developed a hatred of physical buttons. So the brass decided the dashboard had to have the least number of buttons, and so the designers and engineers had no choice but to cram everything in a 10 inch display with icons more at home on a tablet. Why not delegate some of those functions to a set of physical buttons that are not only more convenient to use, but also easier to locate and understand for everybody? But if you think this screen is bad, you have to have a go at trying to adjust the temperature and fan speed on the air con screen. Here we enter the realm of ridiculousness as we have to locate and press a small circular icon on the not-so-responsive screen, make sure it is showing the right shape relative to the function we want to use, and then go to the digital rotary dial to get the desired effect. You notice that throughout this procedure our eyes have been off the road and focused on some tiny icons, our mental capacities employed in the service of the hand-eye coordination required to complete the task successfully. Hmm, quite a lot of trouble to go through not to have some physical keys…|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2019/07/the-question-of-ergonomics-vis-a-vis-modern-in-car-displays/

County executive expresses frustration over state ban on striking officers Around 2,000 officers lost their jobs as a result of the strike. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video MAYVILLE, N.Y. — Even though the New York State prison guard strike is now over, some lawmakers are still showing frustration over how the situation was handled. Much of that frustration has been about New York Gov. Kathy Hochul's decision to ban correctional officers who were terminated during the strike from ever working for the state again. Around 2,000 officers lost their jobs as a result of the strike. The latest disapproval of Hochul's decision comes from Chautauqua County Executive Paul Wendel. These officers took a stand because they were desperate for change, Wendel said. They faced chronic understaffing, mandatory overtime, excessively long shifts, and the ever-growing threat of violence within our prisons. Instead of addressing these concerns, the state responded by blacklisting them, stripping them of their careers, and canceling their health insurance. Wendel encouraged any corrections officer who decided to make a career change or lost their position to apply for a job in Chautauqua County government. Chautauqua County values your experience, dedication, and service, and we invite you to explore opportunities within our county government where your skills can continue to make a difference, he said. Wendel said while the prison guard strike is done, he's still pushing for state leadership to engage in meaningful reforms. It's time for the Governor and the Legislature to listen to those on the front lines, Wendel said. We must restore order, protect those who serve, and ensure the safety of everyone in our correctional system. My door is always open to help facilitate this dialogue. I have always, and will always, back our law enforcement community.|2025-03-16|https://www.wgrz.com/article/news/local/frustration-nys-ban-striking-prison-officers/71-df21519b-6c6c-407e-9557-f8c57e1f8d51
About our Benefits news Latest news on the UK's benefits system. The United Kingdom has a comprehensive system of social security and welfare benefits. These benefits are available to all UK residents, regardless of their employment status. The benefits system is designed to provide a safety net for those in need and to ensure that everyone can enjoy a basic standard of living. The main types of benefits available in the UK are income-related benefits, disability benefits, carer's benefits, and bereavement benefits. Some of the main benefits in the UK include: - Universal Credit: a monthly payment that replaces six other benefits (income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, Working Tax Credit, Child Tax Credit, and Housing Benefit) for people who are on a low income or out of work. - Pension Credit: a means-tested benefit that tops up the income of pensioners who have reached the qualifying age. - Employment and Support Allowance: a benefit for people who have a health condition or disability that affects their ability to work. - Personal Independence Payment: a benefit for people who have a long-term health condition or disability that affects their daily living or mobility. - Disability Living Allowance: a benefit for children under 16 who have a long-term health condition or disability that affects their daily living or mobility. - Attendance Allowance: a benefit for people aged 65 or over who have a long-term health condition or disability that requires personal care or supervision. - Child Benefit: a benefit for parents or guardians of children under 16 (or under 20 if they are in approved education or training). - Housing Benefit: a benefit for people on a low income who need help with their rent. - Council Tax Reduction: a benefit for people on a low income who need help with their council tax bill. There are also other benefits and allowances for specific groups of people, such as carers, veterans, bereaved people, students, and asylum seekers. To claim benefits in the UK, people usually need to meet certain eligibility criteria, such as their nationality, residence status, income, savings, age, health condition, work status, and family situation. They also need to apply through the relevant government agency or online service and provide evidence of their circumstances. Some benefits are paid automatically based on tax records or other information. The UK benefits system aims to provide a safety net for people who are in need and to reduce poverty and inequality in society. However, it also faces some challenges and criticisms, such as its complexity, cost, adequacy, fairness, fraud, error, and impact on work incentives.|2025-03-16|https://www.newsnow.co.uk/h/UK/Benefits

Washington, United States — President Donald Trump took his contentious bid to end birthright citizenship in the United States to the Supreme Court on Thursday. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, which he signed on his first day in office, was blocked by federal district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state. Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution, which decrees that anyone born on American soil is a citizen, and Trump's order seeks to end it for children whose parents are in the country illegally or on temporary student, work or tourist visas. In an emergency application with the Supreme Court, the Justice Department sought to narrow the scope of the nationwide lower court injunctions to the individual plaintiffs in the three cases. The department's acting solicitor general Sarah Harris described it as a modest request and she notably did not seek a ruling from the Supreme Court at this time as to whether eliminating birthright citizenship is constitutional or not. Those universal injunctions prohibit a Day 1 Executive Order from being enforced anywhere in the country, Harris wrote. While the parties litigate weighty merits questions, the Court should 'restrict the scope' of multiple preliminary injunctions that 'purport to cover every person in the country,' limiting those injunctions to parties actually within the courts' power, she said. Trump has been facing legal pushback in courts across the country as he attempts to stem illegal immigration, slash the government budget and reduce the federal workforce. In his latest setback, a district judge in California on Thursday ordered six federal agencies to rehire thousands of probationary workers who had been fired.|2025-03-16|https://tribune.net.ph/2025/03/15/trump-takes-us-birthright-citizenship-to-supreme-court
West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) — President Trump says he has ordered a decisive military action against Houthi rebels in Yemen, opening a new salvo against the Iran-backed group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Trump said the US would deploy overwhelming lethal force against the group until we have achieved our objective. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote on Truth Social. He said US personnel were carrying out aerial attacks on Houthi bases, leaders and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World, Trump wrote. Trump approved the Houthi strike plan — which he requested to be drawn up several weeks ago — late last week, and the final order was given on Saturday to begin what officials describe as a sustained attack on the group's positions in Yemen. Some members of Congress received briefings from the White House on Saturday. Further actions after Saturday will depend on battle damage assessments from this series of strikes, a US defense official told CNN. But there is expected to be more action against the Houthis over the next several weeks. A larger campaign of strikes took time to organize and plan because the US had to collect the intelligence necessary for more sweeping attacks against the Houthis, and that took a considerable amount of time. A senior military official recently told CNN the intel collection required for broader strikes had been completed. The US has been working to degrade Houthi capabilities for months as the entity worked to disrupt international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, one of the world's busiest waterways, calling the attacks a response to Israel's war in Gaza against Hamas. The group has targeted more than 100 ships and vessels, including with drones, missiles and small ships. The Biden administration sought to respond by carrying out targeted strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen, including attacking underground weapons storage facilities in October and November, but the actions did not prevent further attacks. The Houthis had previously promised to stop attacks on ships in the Red Sea so long as the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas was maintained. For more than a year, the group had carried out attacks on cargo ships in what it called revenge against Israel for its military campaign in Gaza, leading to a protracted crisis in the sea's busy shipping corridor. This ban will continue until the crossings into the Gaza Strip are opened and its needs for food and medicine are allowed to enter, the Houthis said on Tuesday. This is not a one off. This is the beginning of an ongoing series of events that will last days if not weeks, a source familiar with the strategy told CNN. There is not and will not be an invasion or troops on ground. But there will be a series of ongoing strategic targeted attacks. Earlier this year, Trump signed an order designating the Houthis a foreign terrorist organization. Trump, in his message, said the Biden administration's approach to the Houthis was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times, he wrote. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, he went on. To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he said. At least nine people were killed and nine injured by the attacks on the Yemeni capital, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The president also offered a message to Iran, which backs the group. To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.somersetcountygazette.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/
With a slate that will consist of academics and professionals, the Red Dot United (RDU) party said it is confident it has a fighting chance against the ruling PAP at the coming polls. On the sidelines of a porridge distribution event at Bukit Batok East Point on March 15, RDU secretary-general Ravi Philemon also revealed a new face to the media - tech start-up business director Pang Heng Chuan. The area is part of the reconfigured Jurong East-Bukit Batok GRC, which is one of the six constituencies that the opposition party intends to contest in the general election. Mr Philemon introduced Mr Pang as one of the architects of the RDU's economic proposals, and called the RDU central executive council member a clear thinker, committed leader and a compassionate person . Mr Pang was part of a group of about 15 RDU members and volunteers who gave out porridge and interacted with residents for about an hour. The group included former RDU candidate for Jurong GRC and author Liyana Dhamirah. Speaking to reporters, Mr Pang said he joined RDU after the 2020 General Election. Issues he is concerned about include cost of living and a Singapore where citizens have a fair share of economic growth. Under RDU, he has stepped in to write to town councils and MPs on behalf of residents, including on cleanliness issues. He said he has been walking the ground in Radin Mas, Jurong and Nee Soon, and does not know where he might be fielded. RDU's first election outing was in 2020, when the party was just three weeks old. Led by Mr Philemon, the RDU team stood in Jurong GRC against a team led by then Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam. The PAP won with 74.62 per cent of the vote. Mr Philemon pointed out that since GE2020, the party has concentrated its efforts on the Taman Jurong ward, where it had its weakest performance due to the popularity of Mr Tharman. Supporters had told him that RDU would stand a better chance in Jurong GRC after Mr Tharman left the constituency to become president, but the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee's report has hived off Taman Jurong into the new West Coast-Jurong West GRC. These are the cards we've been dealt with. If you ask me if it's fair, I will say that it's not fair because we have put in a lot of work, he said. But the party is prepared for the upcoming election, with more than 20 people having been trained as potential candidates since February 2024, he said. The training included professional grooming and education on the party's policies. In the past five years, we have built enough brand (recognition), and we have enough good people. In 2020, we were an 11-man party, while in 2025, we have 250 people helping us in different areas of party activities, said Mr Philemon.

It was too late to get another location as volunteers had already been informed, but Mr Philemon said he gave clear instructions that RDU's event be held a distance from the pavilion and to not obstruct what the MP of the area was doing. In a cordial and friendly exchange, Mr Philemon and Ms Rahayu shook hands and passed each other the porridge they were distributing.

Perhaps no industry was more devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic than the restaurant industry. More than 8 million restaurant employees were laid off or furloughed, and the industry lost $280 billion in sales during the first 13 months of the pandemic, according to the National Restaurant Association. Collectively, restaurants in the Centennial State lost more than $3 billion in sales in 2020, when the pandemic erupted, and, at the height of the indoor closures, shed 94,000 jobs, according to the Colorado Restaurant Association. More than a dozen Colorado Springs restaurants closed their doors that year, according to previous Gazette reporting. To survive, it helped to be nimble and adapt. Now, five years later, some of the initiatives put into place by restaurants and bars around Colorado Springs still live on. Red Gravy, Paravicini's Italian Bistro, Eleven18 Latin Tapas Bar and Cerberus Brewing Co. were among the local businesses that adapted in the spring of 2020 when faced with mandated shutdowns of in-person dining and then requirements for social distancing. Red Gravy, an Italian restaurant on Tejon Street in downtown Colorado Springs, initiated delivery and takeout options in 2019 just before the pandemic hit. Owner Eric Brenner then switched his servers to delivery drivers so he didn't have to lay off staff. Delivery and takeout got Red Gravy through the beginning of the pandemic before outdoor and indoor dining was allowed, Brenner said, and now accounts for 10% of sales. Creating connection with community was also important for Red Gravy and other Colorado Springs businesses. In March 2020, Red Gravy delivered meals to area hospital workers and EMTs while their cafeterias were shut down. It's the most beautiful thing I've done in my career, Brenner said. After hospital dining spaces reopened, Red Gravy's Meals to Heal program evolved into a Sunday Supper Club cooking demonstration program. Outdoor dining options became important downtown and elsewhere, too. The recently announced revitalize Tejon Street project, which among other things will widen sidewalks and provide more space for outdoor dining on two blocks of Tejon Street, borrows from those past experiences, Brenner said. In Old Colorado City Delivery and to-go services provided by Paravicini's Italian Bistro in Old Colorado City ramped up during the pandemic and remain a big part of its revenue, according to Franco Pisani, the restaurant's owner. Like Red Gravy, delivery and takeout helped Paravicini's avoid layoffs. Pay-what-you-can meal kits and Wednesday night online cooking classes also kept Paravicini's moving ahead. Around 1,500 people tuned in to watch classes at their peak. One lady's son died from COVID, and she told me every Wednesday her friends would pick up meal kits and a bottle of wine, Pisani said. They would then all go over to her house and forget about life for a while while they watched my cooking class.

Featured Local Savings Slushies and cocktails on the go Cerberus Brewing Co., just west of downtown on Colorado Avenue, started canning its craft brews, installed a beer slushie machine and took advantage of temporary legislative approval of to-go alcoholic beverage sales. Cerberus generates about 15% of its revenue thanks to sales of 4-packs at more than 40 stores and other restaurants. To-go beverages became permanent law last year. We focused on our core menu and we did everything we could to not lay off any employees, said Tom Halfast, who owns the brewery and restaurant with Jerry Morris. Expanded outdoor seating, a variation of the tent with heaters used in 2020, remains at Cerberus. We had tremendous community support, Halfast said. We had people from around the neighborhood walking here every day, sometimes twice a day. They will come and build it Brother Luck, owner and chef behind Four by Brother Luck, Eleven18 and The Studio, had loyal customers to thank as he switched up the formula. Meal kits, curbside takeout and online cooking classes were offered. The online classes morphed into in-person classes since the pandemic. The online classes dropped a wall between me and my guests, Luck said. Luck owned Lucky Dumpling, which occupied space now used by Eleven18, downtown on Colorado Avenue. He closed Lucky Dumpling and opened Eleven18 based on themes he learned through COVID-19, including the menu limitations faced through supply chain shortages. Outdoor seating also took on a bigger focus. Two tents for required customer distancing turned into outdoor patio seating. The new patio was built in 2021 with help from HBA Cares, part of the Housing & Building Association of Colorado Springs, and loyal customers, who showed up with lumber and tools. I really built a new bond with my customers when we were building that patio, Luck said. The community came out to help, and a lot of them were customers of ours that wanted to see us open back up for dine-in.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/business/5-years-later-how-local-restaurants-adapted-with-meal-kits-online-classes-and-more-to/article_860b30c8-fb74-11ef-a146-c7b34e957d2e.html
A former Texas sex worker serving time on death row has had her conviction overturned after a violation of her rights. Brittany Holberg is one of seven women who are currently serving time on death row in Texas after being convicted of murder in Amarillo. Now the death row inmate will not be put to death after learning a key witness was actually an informant. The Murder Brittany Holberg was convicted in 1998 for robbing and murdering an 80-year-old man while being a sex worker in Amarillo, Texas. At the time, Holberg was 23 years old, had fallen on hard times, and had relied on the help of A.B. Towery, a client of Holberg's. Holberg admitted to stabbing Towery multiple times but maintained it was self-defense. During the trial, the prosecution used Holberg's jail cellmate testimony who said that Holberg admitted she had killed Towery for money. As it turns out, that testimony violated Holberg's rights because that cellmate was actually an informant working for the City of Amarillo. RELATED:Texas Ranges Increase Reward For Unsolved Murder Conviction Overturned What a crazy turn of events.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. / Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe available at the AFP Online Store. Americans concerned about dangerous effects of vaccinations had hoped, based on candidate Trump's statements, that the new president would empanel a commission to review the dangerous practice. Unfortunately, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says that seems to have fallen off the president's priorities list. By Donald Jeffries Shortly before the inauguration of President Donald Trump, stories appeared all across the mainstream media about a proposed presidential commission to study the possible links between vaccines and autism. What made the story all the more intriguing was that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told The Washington Post and other outlets that Trump had tapped him to chair the commission. The article regarding this in the Jan. 10, 2017 issue of the Post epitomized the biased nature of the press. In the opening sentence, Kennedy was smeared for being a proponent of a widely discredited theory that vaccines cause autism. Predictably, Trump appeared to immediately retreat in the midst of this media backlash, with a spokeswoman for the president-elect issuing a statement only hours later, which threw water on the idea. Trump, like Kennedy, has a history of being critical of vaccines, and had met with Kennedy at Trump Tower. Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe / An Examination of Corporate Manipulation and Vested Interest in Public Health, from the AFP Online Store. Following the meeting, Trump transition spokeswoman Hope Hicks issued the following statement: The president-elect enjoyed his discussion with Robert Kennedy Jr. on a range of issues and appreciates his thoughts and ideas. The president-elect is exploring the possibility of forming a commission on autism, which affects so many families; however, no decisions have been made at this time. After meeting with the president-elect, Kennedy told reporters assembled in the lobby of New York's Trump Tower: President-elect Trump has some doubts about the current vaccine policies, and he has questions about it. His opinion doesn't matter, but the science does matter, and we ought to be reading the science, and we ought to be debating the science. Kennedy would later state that he'd met many times with members of Trump's transition team. The Post spoke for the entire Deep State when it closed this article with, The announcement was met with alarm from health professionals who say that putting a proponent of a conspiracy theory in a position of authority on the issue is dangerous. The article quoted Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute, as saying, That's very frightening; it's difficult to imagine anyone less qualified to serve on a commission for vaccine science. … The science is clear: massive evidence showing no link between vaccines and autism… . Our nation's public health will suffer if this nascent neo-anti-vaxxer movement is not stopped immediately. Corporate Ties That Bind Kennedy had been highly critical of vaccines for years. They get the shot. That night they have a fever of 103. They go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone, Kennedy said at the premiere of an anti-vaccination 2015 film screening. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country. Kennedy has been labeled the iconic family's most noted conspiracy theorist. In 2006, he wrote an article for Rolling Stone magazine, which was later taken off of their web site, alleging massive voter fraud in the 2004 election. He has also become the first member of the Kennedy family to openly question the lone-assassin conclusion in the assassinations of both his uncle and his father. During one of the Republican presidential debates in 2015, Trump had clashed with fellow candidate Ben Carson on the issue. We had so many instances, people that work for me, just the other day, two years old, a beautiful child, went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic, Trump stated. Trump continued to tweet about the subject, and before the election met with some prominent anti-vaccine activists, including Dr. Andrew Wakefield of Great Britain, widely considered the foremost expert on the links between vaccines and autism, before the establishment succeeded in getting him disbarred. The Age of Autism website, which looks at myriad causes for autism, was overjoyed at this, declaring that Trump was extremely educated on our issues. Earlier this year, Kennedy boldly called the Centers for Disease Control a subsidiary of the pharmaceutical industry. Get Out of Cash There was little updated news about the proposed commission until February 2018, when Kennedy said he'd had no contact with the White House for at least six months. I would say there's zero progress, Kennedy explained to The Guardian. We were told President Trump wanted to meet directly with us. Not only did nothing happen, they've cut off all communication with people who care about this issue. The administration [is going] in another direction. Kennedy added, I've seen a tremendous deflation among a community of parents and children's health advocates across the country who believed the promises that President Trump made to the campaign, who put tremendous faith in him and now are feeling enormous betrayal and disappointment.|2025-03-16|https://americanfreepress.net/what-ever-happened-to-the-vaccine-autism-commission/
NASHVILLE, TN (utsports.com) - The fourth-seeded University of Tennessee men's basketball team took down top-seeded Auburn, 70-65, in a top-10 showdown Saturday afternoon in the SEC Tournament semifinals at Bridgestone Arena. No. 8/6 Tennessee (27-6, 12-6 SEC) defeated the third-ranked Tigers behind a team-high 20 points from senior guard Zakai Zeigler to reach the conference championship for the fourth time in the last seven events. The triumph also gave the Volunteers their seventh AP top-15 win of the season, a new school record, including their fourth over a top-seven foe to tie the program's best mark. Fifth-year guard Chaz Lanier got off to a fast start in his hometown for the second day in a row, scoring eight points and making all three of his field-goal attempts in the opening 3:23. He upped his total to 10 points on 4-of-4 shooting through 9:53, as the Volunteers took a 22-17 lead. Tennessee stretched its first-half advantage as high as seven, 26-19, with 7:52 left in the frame. Auburn (28-5, 15-3 SEC) then held the Volunteers scoreless for 5:15, a span during which they scored 10 straight points to go up, 29-26, with 3:27 on the timer. The Volunteers responded to twice take the lead, but the Tigers took a 33-32 edge into the locker room. Tennessee made all seven—each came from Zeigler—of its first-half free throws, while Auburn missed four of its eight, but the Volunteers got outscored 9-0 in points off turnovers, committing six and forcing two. Senior forward/center Johni Broome, the SEC Player of the Year, paced Auburn with 12 points on 6-of-7 shooting, while Zeigler led Tennessee with 11 points. The Tigers scored six straight points in 70 seconds early in the second frame to go ahead by five, 41-36, with 16:43 to play. Tennessee countered with a 9-2 burst to claim a 45-43 lead with 13:37 remaining, at which time it also entered the bonus. Auburn countered with a 3-pointer at the other end, but Tennessee then went on an impressive 17-4 run, including scoring eight straight points in 2:28, to go ahead by a game-best 12 points, 62-50, with 7:17 to go. It held Auburn without a field goal for 5:16, forcing five straight misses, and did not even allow a point for a span of 3:38. The Tigers soon went on a 10-0 run, featuring two 3-pointers, in just 1:39 to get the margin down to two, 64-62, with 4:10 left. However, they got no closer. Sophomore forward Cade Phillips doubled the lead with a tip-in at the 3:24 mark and then, after a free throw by Auburn, senior guard Jordan Gainey made it 68-63 on a layup with 2:23 remaining. Auburn scored with 1:16 to play to get the margin to three and then had a chance to level the score, but missed all three of their field goals and both their free throws in the final 29 seconds. Senior guard Jahmai Mashack iced the victory by hitting two free throws with 14 seconds to play. Zeigler finished 9-of-9 at the line, his most makes without a miss as a Volunteer, and hit four of his five shots inside the arc to reach 20 points for the 10th time as a collegian and third this year. He led all players with four assists to up his 2024-25 mark to 234 and enter the 10 on the SEC single-season list. Gainey totaled 15 points, five rebounds and a perfect 8-of-8 ledger at the stripe, tying his most makes without a miss as a collegian. Lanier finished with 12 points, while junior forward Felix Okpara grabbed a game-leading nine rebounds before fouling out in the final minute. Broome concluded the contest with 23 points and a team-best seven rebounds, shooting 9-of-13 from the field and 5-of-12 at the line. Senior guards Miles Kelly and Denver Jones had 13 points and 10 points, respectively, but Tennessee limited the latter to a 1-of-6 and his line make was Auburn's first of the day. The Volunteers shot 25-of-27 (92.6 percent) at the stripe, while the Tigers posted just a 13-of-22 (59.1 percent) mark. The victors, who made their final 16 free throws over the last 16:19, also had a commanding 25-3 advantage in bench points.

Rep. Abe Hamadeh R-Ariz., has challenged Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta Platforms Inc. about its purported plans for a censored platform in China. In a post on X, Hamadeh's office wrote: Today, Congressman Hamadeh sent a letter to Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg regarding a whistleblower's shocking allegations that Meta assisted Communist China in their censorship efforts in America. If true, these claims indicate a willingness to collaborate with an authoritarian regime to suppress free expression, contradicting Meta's public statements on free speech and digital rights.

The U.S. government is ending funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), headquartered in Prague, and scaling back Voice of America operations, according to Reuters. The move follows President Donald Trump's directive to reduce the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to the legal minimum, citing federal workforce reductions. Most Voice of America staff have been placed on administrative leave. Critics, including the Committee to Protect Journalists, warned the decision undermines press freedom in countries with restricted media.

Originally from Michigan's Upper Peninsula, after university, US Air Force, and business travel and life all across America and Europe, Larry moved to the Sierra Foothills in late 1997 from Morgan Hill. Leaving the Bay Area and an IBM Corporation career behind him, he loves living here in the Sierra Foothills. In early retirement, working now and then as a consultant for his and spouse Helen's software consulting company, he wakes up every day with the energy gained only by staying busy. Full time work, KVMR Community Radio, volunteering, hiking, and family time are the fountain of youth. Over the years of full time day jobs, Larry found time to coach middle and high school basketball, start a girls' softball league, own a brewpub, backpack the Pacific Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada, serve on a city Parks and Recreation Commission and several Boards of Directors, and volunteer for dozens of groups in ways ranging from parking cars to clearing trash to leadership. For those who haven't tried it, volunteering is life. And the single right way to meet the best people. A broadcaster since 2001, first doing years of early morning radio, now privileged to be part of the long time, incredible Saturday roots music mix, Larry loves every moment he spends at KVMR. In particular, he values our role as Voice of the Community, giving voice to the hundreds of non-profit organizations and individuals in our listening area. Try to imagine a radio station run by a small paid staff, supported totally by its own efforts in fundraising, membership, and underwriters, helped in every imaginable way by hundreds of volunteers, and where all broadcasting is done by unpaid volunteers. Clearly, this must be impossible. Yet KVMR has been doing just that for over three decades. How could any person not value their role in such a place? How about you? Try us, you'll like us. Larry joined the KVMR Board of Directors in 2009. Thanks to those who have come before, KVMR has grown from its tiny beginnings on Banner Mountain and through varying crises and successes into a mature, financially secure, and vibrant organization. Larry thanks our countless contributors, allowing us the roots, wings, and independence to provide the best community service and radio possible. He looks forward to serving this community and doing his part to ensure that KVMR continues its vital role into the far distant future.CONTACT THIS BROADCASTER|2025-03-16|https://www.kvmr.org/users/larry-hillberg/
We are very supportive of [Pan's] talk about significantly allocating foreign exchange reserves in Hong Kong , Yue said at the Legislative Council meeting on February 3. He declined to quantify the PBOC support, implying secret and market-sensitive information. If more of the reserves are invested in our market, it will definitely improve our liquidity and sentiment. China has diversified its holding of foreign currencies in its reserves as geopolitical tensions escalated. The US dollar made up 55 per cent of its currency composition in 2019, versus the global average of 61 per cent, according to SAFE's annual reports. The ratio was 65 per cent in 2010. That is reflected in its holding of US Treasuries, the gold standard in global government bond markets. China, which overtook Japan as the largest foreign holder of Treasuries in 2008, owned US$1.3 trillion of the securities at its peak in 2013, according to government data. It held US$1.26 trillion in 2015, or 37.4 per cent of its reserves, US$1.07 trillion (34.4 per cent) in 2019 and US$759 billion (23.7 per cent) last year. Some countries, including China, would be cautious about investing more in US treasuries due to geopolitical tensions and fiscal deficit, according to Wang Ju, head of foreign-exchange and rates strategy for Greater China at BNP Paribas in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong market thus represents the optimal choice for China, she added. Assuming an additional 10 per cent of China's foreign exchange reserves is invested in Hong Kong dollar bonds, the city's US$350 billion bond market would receive a US$300 billion shot in the arm, she estimated. Even though details are scarce, the PBOC's support for Hong Kong is seen as a pre-emptive foil against volatilities in the stock and currency markets - especially in an international financial hub where capital swarms in and out with little impedance - which have confounded investors barely two months into Trump's second term. Conflicts between China and the US will inevitably arise, and Hong Kong could help mitigate some of the pressure, experts say. The city has successfully navigated multiple financial shocks, including the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and the global financial crisis in 2008.

Photo: Reuters> China's financial strength is even greater today, with the world's largest foreign exchange reserves providing a strong backing for Hong Kong's financial stability and security , Pan said at the Asian Financial Forum in January. China has the confidence, conditions and capability to maintain the stable operation of the foreign exchange market , he added. SAFE invests in international bonds, equities and alternative assets through units in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York (Rosewood Investments), London (Gingko Tree Investments) and Frankfurt, according to data compiled by the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. About 22 per cent of its money is invested in alternative assets. To be sure, SAFE Investment Company in Hong Kong is not the only vehicle deploying China's foreign exchange reserves. Beijing also entrusted about a third of its reserves to China Investment Corp, a vehicle established in 2007 to diversify and maximise returns. The sovereign wealth fund has offshore units based in Hong Kong and New York. Allocating more foreign reserves to Hong Kong could strengthen the city's financial position. The city could become a key battleground in future conflicts with the US, and Pan's statement could be interpreted as a signal that China is prepared to further trim its holdings of US Treasuries. Sometimes, through informal channels or non-official sources, people say that China might sell off a portion of its US Treasury holdings, as this could have a significant impact on the US financial market, said Zhang Jun, dean of the School of Economics at Fudan University in Shanghai. It could be used as a form of leverage to bargain with the US. The head office of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange in Beijing.

Adding more Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and steady-dividend stocks listed in Hong Kong would represent a strategic shift in investment direction, he added. Shifting reserves towards Hong Kong would strengthen the credibility of the currency board, according to Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University. Technically, this could be a way of expanding liquidity in the Hong Kong market. Hong Kong operates a currency board, which stipulates that its monetary base must be at least 100 per cent backed by foreign exchange reserves. While that ratio stood at more than five times the currency in circulation as of February, an explicit backing from the PBOC could serve as a deterrent to currency speculators, according to Xu Bin, a professor of economics and finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai. The local dollar is linked to the US dollar at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US dollar, and the HKMA intervenes if necessary to keep the value within its HK$7.75 to HK$7.85 trading band. The link has been challenged in the past, most recently during the pandemic when Hong Kong was facing a recession. Higher demand for Hong Kong dollars could ease the pressure on the currency peg, said Xu. By simply making the statement, the PBOC also sent a signal to say we will serve as a strong backing for the Hong Kong Linked Exchange Rate System, he added.

Its monthly rent would have fallen by about a third from the HK$2.06 million (US$265,000), or HK$147 per square foot 14 years ago, agents said. Cheng Hao, the man at the helm of the reserves management vehicle, is no stranger to financial crises. Before his appointment as a director of SAFE Investment Company in Hong Kong in January, the chartered accountant served as the deputy chief operating officer in Beijing, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was also a senior vice-president between 2014 and 2016 during China's worst stock market crash. Cheng managed Kunteng Investments, a fund used to buttress the nation's stock market during the US$5 trillion meltdown in 2015. Its holdings included stakes in Gemdale Corp, Bright Dairy & Food, Tianjin Port Development, China Unicom, and Zhuhai Huafa Group, according to a 2018 report by the state-run Beijing Youth Daily newspaper. The fund was part of Wutongshu Investment, a SAFE platform and a national team member seeded with 27 billion yuan (US$3.7 billion) firepower to rescue the market. He did not reply to a request for an interview. China's central bank has made a series of moves since January to support Hong Kong's status as a global hub for the offshore yuan, including a 100 billion yuan trade financing facility for banks and a new programme for offshore yuan repurchase agreements, or a short-term borrowing instrument. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre needs to be further strengthened to avoid complacency, given the fresh challenges from trade tariffs and geopolitical rivalries, according to Yang Jianwen, a researcher at the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences. Hong Kong's role as an international financial centre is irreplaceable by any other place in mainland China, he said. Increasing the proportion of foreign exchange reserves to Hong Kong's financial assets is a viable approach.|2025-03-16|https://finance.yahoo.com/news/safe-hands-chinas-secret-plan-093000683.html
to commit a felony (F3) Carl Fish Beginning September 19, 2023, Polk County Sheriff's Office, Lakeland Police Department, Haines City Police Department, Tampa Police Department, Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Lake County Sheriff's Office, and Orange County Sheriff's Office detectives conducted a seven-day-long undercover operation, during which detectives posed as children or guardians of children on social media platforms, mobile apps, and online dating sites to investigate those who prey upon and travel to meet children for unlawful sexual activity. The suspects communicated with and solicited who they thought were children or guardians online. Six suspects showed up to an undercover location in Polk County at separate times to sexually batter children.Three of the six suspects wanted to pay an adult hundreds of dollars to have sex with who they thought was a child – those three were charged with human trafficking, a life felony. Three of the suspects brought condoms to the undercover location, three told detectives they are married, and three have children. They were all from the central Florida area. In all, detectives filed 22 felony charges against the suspects. SUSPECTS ARRESTED: 1. 40-year-old Jairo Muniz of Kissimmee, FL. Muniz engaged in an online conversation on a social networking site and via cell phone with an undercover detective who was posing as a 13-year-old girl.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

By BRUCE SHIPKOWSKI, JULIE WALKER and REBECCA REYNOLDS Violent tornadoes ripped through parts of the U.S., wiping out schools and toppling semitractor-trailers in several states, part of a monster storm that has killed at least 26 people as more severe weather was expected late Saturday. The number of fatalities increased after the Kansas Highway Patrol reported eight people died in a highway pileup caused by a dust storm in Sherman County Friday. At least 50 vehicles were involved. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Dakota Henderson said he and others rescuing people trapped in their homes Friday night found five dead bodies scattered in the debris outside what remained of his aunt's house in hard-hit Wayne County, Missouri. It was a very rough deal last night, he said Saturday, surrounded by uprooted trees and splintered homes. It's really disturbing for what happened to the people, the casualties last night. Henderson said they rescued his aunt from a bedroom that was the only room left standing in her house, taking her out through a window. They also carried out a man who had a broken arm and leg. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. She and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. Extreme weather encompasses a zone of 100 million people The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible. Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions. Evacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. Nearly 300 homes were damaged or destroyed. Gov. Kevin Stitt said at a Saturday news conference that some 266 square miles (689 square kilometers) had burned in his state. The State Patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. Experts said it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreak The Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible. Significant tornadoes continued to hit Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, the center said. Bailey Dillon, 24, and her fiance, Caleb Barnes, watched a massive tornado from their front porch in Tylertown, Mississippi, about half a mile (0.8 km) away as it struck an area near Paradise Ranch RV Park. They drove over afterward to see if anyone needed help and recorded a video depicting snapped trees, leveled buildings and overturned vehicles. The amount of damage was catastrophic, Dillon said. It was a large amount of cabins, RVs, campers that were just flipped over — everything was destroyed. Paradise Ranch reported on Facebook that all its staff and guests were safe and accounted for, but Dillon said the damage extended beyond the ranch itself. Homes and everything were destroyed all around it, she said. Schools and buildings are just completely gone. Some of the imagery from the extreme weather has gone viral. Tad Peters and his dad, Richard Peters, had pulled over to fuel up their pickup truck in Rolla, Missouri, Friday night when they heard tornado sirens and saw other motorists flee the interstate to park. Whoa, is this coming? Oh, it's here. It's here, Tad Peters can be heard saying on a video. Look at all that debris. Ohhh. My God, we are in a torn … His father then rolled up the truck window. The two were headed to Indiana for a weightlifting competition but decided to turn around and head back home to Norman, Oklahoma, about six hours away, where they encountered wildfires. Wildfires elsewhere in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds in Texas, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico. A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening. About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon. High winds also knocked out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan, according the website poweroutage.us. ___ Shipkowski reported from Toms River, New Jersey. Walker reported from New York. Reynolds contributed from Louisville, Kentucky. Jeff Roberson in Wayne County, Missouri, Eugene Johnson in Seattle and Janie Har in San Francisco contributed.

March 15, 2025 By: Dwayne Page The Town of Alexandria is again without a police chief at least temporarily. On Thursday March 13, Mayor Beth Tripp issued a written reprimand of Police Chief Kenneth (K.D.) Smith and placed him on suspension without pay until a disciplinary hearing before the mayor and aldermen Thursday night, March 20 at 7 p.m. at city hall. The mayor's written reprimand or write-ups to go in the chief's personnel file are based on alleged events which occurred on November 30, 2024, December 14, 2024, March 10, 2025, and March 13, 2025. WJLE was unable to make contact with Mayor Tripp by phone for comment Saturday but Chief Smith provided WJLE with a copy of the mayor's written reprimand as shown here which alleges as follows: Resident complaints on several occasions telling residents city information Making workplace intolerable Making workers and myself (mayor) feel unsafe. This isn't the first time I gave several warnings on your temper and voice getting loud Body language shows anger Not following chain of command on several occasions Talked with you several times trying to get you to calm down Many residents have complained to me about you On Thursday, March 13 at around 3 or 3:30 p.m. the mayor came in and told me to go home for the day. About 15 minutes later I was getting ready to leave and I got called in the office to read and sign a written reprimand. I read over it. I put on it non agreeable because I don't agree with the information that was written down. I initialed it and handed it back to her. I had to turn in my badge, my gun and the keys to the vehicle (patrol car) and to the department. I left the vehicle parked and I had to get an officer to get me a ride home, said Chief Smith. She (mayor) suspended me without pay. I have a hearing on March 20 at 7 p.m. at city hall to determine the disciplinary action toward me. I presume that will be either to dismiss the suspension, uphold it or terminate me, Chief Smith continued. According to Chief Smith, the allegations are baseless and without merit. As far as I know I have a good rapport and good relationship with all the citizens in the town that I have had contact with and all the businesspeople. I'm the type of person that I go and sit down and talk with the businesspeople. I see people sitting on their front porch and I have stopped and talked with them. I don't know where the citizen complaints are coming from. That'll be something that I will address at the hearing. I am trying to build a good police department for the city, and we have a good working relationship with everybody. We're trying to get there but this is kind of a slap in the face, said Chief Smith. According to Chief Smith, the police department is now left with only three part time officers. There are no full-time officers right now. There are only part time officers trying to cover the town and there will be days between now and my hearing that there will be limited police presence. I hate that for the citizens of the town, he said.|2025-03-16|https://www.wjle.com/news/mayor-places-alexandria-police-chief-on-suspension-without-pay-pending-hearing/

Amazon I'm a product guy. Way back in the day I was actually a product marketing executive for a big tech company. I've shipped hundreds of products over the years. You always try to marry a need with a solution. Meet enough folks' needs, and they'll buy your product. Generally, though, people have to think they have a need. Oh, sure, that's what marketing's about. Its job is to create demand where there might not have been any. Sometimes, it generates awareness. Sometimes, it generates leads by finding folks who might be a fit for a product. Sometimes, it just generates enough hype that the product takes off as a mere side effect of an intense hype machine. How does this relate to Alexa? Back in 2014, Alexa seemed kind of weird. People couldn't quite figure out why you'd want one. It didn't fit any of the usual product marketing formulas. It was a Pringles-can shaped device you could talk to. Why would you talk to it? Why would you spend a few hundred dollars for it to do what any calculator app would do? Why would you let it take up space just to be a glorified alarm clock? And lights…just flip a switch. It couldn't be any easier. And for playing music? Well, we had stereos, our iPods or phones, and many other ways to play tunes. Sure, the intercom feature might be helpful. But who needs an internet-connected device listening to your every word? But with Alexa, Amazon managed to capture lightning in a bottle…er…can. I know this is subjective, but Alexa -- more so than Siri or Google's assistant -- seems to have just the right balance between personality and helpfulness, between capability and functionality. Whether you're setting a timer while cooking, performing a hands-free math calculation while writing, pausing whatever streaming service you're watching on the Roku TV to ask a trivia or general interest question, Alexa is usually relatively helpful. In 2022, Alexa is ubiquitous. A lot of families have one in practically every room. There's no doubt she's a faceless AI front for a giant corporation, but she has generally always been a friendly, helpful faceless AI front for a giant corporation. The times they are a-changin' But that helpfulness seems like it might be about to change. Last week, Amazon announced it's about to introduce vendor-supplied answers for common Alexa questions. Here's how Amazon describes it: The capability is called Customers ask Alexa, and it works like this: When customers pose questions to Alexa, including queries related to a product's features or compatibilities, Alexa responds with helpful answers provided by brands from those product categories. For example, a customer shopping for cleaning products on Amazon.com could ask, How can I remove pet hair from my carpet? A brand can now provide answers to such questions, along with links to its Amazon storefront. Ruh-roh. Amazon says these are not paid ads. Vendors aren't paying for placement. Instead, there's going to be a new Customers ask Alexa feature in Seller Central, where vendors can see questions and answer them using self-service tools. Answers will then be moderated by an Amazon team tasked with such things. All answers will be attributed to the brand that answers them. According to Rajiv Mehta, general manager of Alexa Shopping at Amazon, Amazon recognizes brands as experts on their products. With this new capability, we have made it easier for brands to connect with customers to help answer common questions and better inform their purchase decisions. Yeah, there's no way this could go wrong. Playing to the algorithm for priority on the SERP (search engine response page) has already irrevocably changed editorial journalism. Most articles (mine included) go through an SEO review. Even if a headline would be enormously appealing to humans (or simply make the most sense), it might be nuked in favor of one that has higher Google juice. Yes, you're still getting valuable content (if I do say so myself), but SEO looms large in almost every editorial decision on almost every website. It's just what everyone now has to do to keep the revenue stream (which is necessary to produce and run expensive publications) coming in. We all need good content, and we all need to pay our bills. It's not unreasonable to expect that vendors will vie for positional prominence in Alexa's vendor-supplied answer system. It's also not unreasonable to expect that sales pitches, even if disguised as oh-so-helpful responses, will invade those answers. This service is not expected until October, so we don't have any sample answers. But we can certainly expect questions like Should I use scissors or electric clippers to cut my hair might result in something like, Never pay for a haircut again with this new cutting-edge design and look your best without the help of others. This answer brought to you by ManGroomer, the ultimate do-it-yourself hair cutting kit. Would you like me to send you one? It can be there in two days. Now, to be fair, the ManGroomer is awesome and did save me from considerable Zoom meeting embarrassment during the height of the pandemic lockdowns. But that's not the point. Being pitched, even for products that work, spoils the helpful relationship many of us have developed with Alexa. No longer is she a trusted helpful friend, she's yet one more door-to-door salesperson trying to sell you something -- except she's already inside the house. We've all had that friend who got all caught up in a multilevel marketing scheme. Now, instead of talking about how 'bout them Yankees? , every other word is a pitch for some MLM product or another. It's annoying, off-putting, and can eventually cause damage to the relationship. It's true that Alexa has already offered some items at random times before (Amazon Music comes to mind). We always answer with an annoyed Ah, no. Nuh-nuh-no. Sometimes she pops up with a yellow-ringed alert that's a reminder to do something about an upcoming Subscribe and Save order. But these promos and notifications have, so far, not been specifically tied to third party vendors. They don't give vendors a way to game the system for the best SEO answer results. This is my concern for Alexa. Amazon's engineers have managed to train Alexa for just the right balance of helpfulness and unobtrusiveness. But if she's constantly trying to push an upsell at us, it's going to get old. First it's ads on answers. Then, perhaps, it would be ads in our timers. Alexa, set timer for 10 minutes. Timer set for ten minutes. Would you like to buy Amazon's Choice Classroom Timers for Teachers. A two-pack is only $6.95. Would you like to act before midnight tonight and place your order for neon-colored timing happiness? Or, perhaps they'll put ads in our wake-up alarms. Good morning David. Perhaps you'd like to buy a box of muffins. I can ship them to you right now? How about more coffee pods? You know you want them. Ooh, I saw you watched The Grand Tour on Amazon Prime Video. Have I got a set of floor mats for you… Will nothing be sacred? Alexa, what's 228 divided by 19? 228 divided by 19 is 12. Speaking of 12, can I interest you in a 12-pack of shoe storage boxes? Amazon's Choice is now $37.95 and I can have them in your hot little hands by Thursday. All you have to do is say yes. Do you want them? Well, do you? Say yes. Go ahead. Say it. Okay, so that's probably an exaggeration. But how many previously wonderful websites now seem like pitch machines due to monetization and SEO? So what makes us think Alexa won't go down that same dark hole? The revenue stream is probably too tempting to ignore. A changing relationship I'm sad about this. Alexa has been a fantastic (and frankly unexpected) boon to many of us. At this point, she's practically a trusted member of the family. But if her essential nature is corrupted by an overreaching quest for yet more Bezos Bucks, it will be a real shame. For example, I wouldn't feel nearly as comfortable having Alexa in my elderly parents' house if I thought she would be pressuring them with brand marketing. The same would go for having her around young children, or anyone with poor impulse control. It's just too easy to say yes to a trusted member of the family. After all, how many times have you said yes to her helpful little queries in the past nine years? For the record, I emailed Amazon PR to ask if there's a way Amazon customers will be able to opt out of these potential upsells and how, beyond content moderation, Amazon can prevent Alexa from turning into an SEO-driven hype machine. I haven't yet gotten a response. I'll update this article if I hear back. So, what do you think? Do you think Alexa is going to turn into an annoying upsell bot? Would you buy anything from Alexa if she pitched it as part of a question answer? Or do you think the world is just going to hell, and this is one more slippery stone on the slippery slope down? Let us know in the comments below.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/is-amazon-about-to-ruin-alexa-answers-with-ads/
KANSAS CITY, Mo. (KCTV) - Our wind stays gusty through Saturday evening from the northwest up to 30 mph. On top of that, a small disturbance comes through, giving us a chance at a few light showers, especially on the Missouri side. Temperatures should be just warm enough for light rain, but as we get later in the evening, a couple of bursts of wet snow will be possible. The farther east you live from KC, the better your chance for some Saturday evening moisture. If you do get a brief snow, we are not expecting accumulation. This chance shuts off after 2 AM and skies will clear. Sunshine is expected on Sunday! While it will not be overly warm, we should reach the mid-50s with the northwest wind eventually turning out of the south. Our wind gusts will not be nearly as strong, but the breeze will still be noticeable. It'll feel pretty comfortable compared to our Saturday. Temperatures will be significantly warm for Monday and Tuesday, but the wind will pick back up. We are expecting a stronger southwest wind on Monday, with gusts up to 30-35 mph. Because of this and the low humidity, we have heightened fire danger yet again. A Fire Weather Watch is in place for Monday afternoon and evening for most of the KCTV viewing area. Burning is not advised. Our next large storm system will impact us in the middle of the week. A First Warn is in place as we are expecting some minor impacts to daily routines Tuesday night and Wednesday. Another deep area of low pressure will slide through the region. Out ahead of it, warm and windy. Behind it, dropping temperatures and stronger winds. There is also a precipitation component again. This time, overnight and into Wednesday morning. We should be warm enough for mostly rain, but as the back side of this storm system swings through, there could be a transition over to a few hours of wet snow. At this time, we think that early morning Wednesday will have the best chance. Since it's brief and the ground is warm, only minor accumulations are expected at this time. Maybe a dusting to an inch near the Iowa state line. The strong wind gusts on Wednesday morning will turn out of the northwest as a potent cold front drops through. This tanks our temperatures Wednesday afternoon only to the 40s. After that midweek shakeup, we gradually warm through the end of the week back to the 50s and 60s.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/first-warn-forecast-few-showers-saturday-evening-sunshine-returns-sunday/
FAIRFIELD, Conn. — A broken play with a bounce in front of the net was scooped up by Sacred Heart's John Murray and deposited into the net for the winning goal as the defending MAAC Champions Sacred Heart escaped with an 11-10 overtime win over Siena Men's Lacrosse on Saturday on Campus Field in Fairfield, Conn.

Norfolk, Va. (AP) — Christian Ings scored 16 points, including the go-ahead free throw with eight seconds left, and top-seeded Norfolk State held off a wild rally by No. 2-seed South Carolina State for a 66-65 victory in the MEAC Tournament championship game on Saturday. With the automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, Norfolk State will be making its third tournament appearance since 2021 and its fourth overall. After Norfolk State led 61-51 near the two-minute mark, Wilson Dubinsky got hot and scored the next 12 points for South Carolina State. He began with a long two-pointer to get them within 64-59 with 57 seconds left. After a timeout, South Carolina State came up with a steal and Dubinsky finished at the rim to make it 64-61. With 12 seconds left, Dubinsky cashed in on another steal to make it 65-63. Again, Norfolk State could not handle the Bulldogs' pressure on the inbounds pass and a steal by Jayden Johnson led to the tying layup by Caleb McCarty with 10 seconds left. McCarty, who apparently did not realize the game was tied, fouled Ings with eight seconds left. Ings made one free throw for the 66-65 lead and Johnson's jumper with one second left was off the mark. A desperation tip by the Bulldogs was also off the mark. READ MORE Dubinsky made 8 of 11 shots, was 5 for 5 on 3-pointers, and finished with 24 points. Omar Croskey had 10 points. The Bulldogs (20-13) had won 11 straight games coming in. Brian Moore Jr. scored 15 points for Norfolk State (24-10). Dubinsky made three 3-pointers in the first half, leading the Bulldogs to a 34-25 halftime lead.

SHANGHAI ((Reuters)) - China should choose the right timing and force in easing monetary policy, state media said on Saturday in the latest signal that further easing to boost the world's second-largest economy may not be imminent. Days before the article in the official Shanghai Securities News, the central bank pledged to adjust monetary policy at the appropriate time to support an economy facing escalating trade tensions with the U.S. On Friday, the central bank-owned Financial News called for finding the right tempo in adjusting monetary policies. The series of comments could further dampen expectations for an imminent cut in interest rates or in banks' reserve requirement ratios. While China still has room to loosen policy, cutting rates or RRR at the appropriate time means choosing the right timing and strength, so as to make the best use of policy tools to cope with various uncertainties in the future, the Shanghai Securities News said. China's monetary policy needs to balance between supporting the economy and preventing risks, and is also constrained by Sino-U.S. yield differentials as well as domestic banks' interest margins. China cut both benchmark interest rates and the RRRs twice last year to bolster the struggling economy. The People's Bank of China has not cut rates this year despite U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs on Chinese goods, putting pressure on an economy mired in deflation and weak consumption. Policy easing, including the use of structural tools, is not just about cutting interest rates or RRRs, the Financial News said in its Friday editorial, adding that monetary easing does not necessarily translate to credit easing, as financial stimulus alone does not lead to a sustainable boom in consumption. Investors are giving up on further monetary easing, wrote Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, citing recent rises in bond yields. Since China's slew of stimulus measures, Huang wrote, there have been no policy rate reductions... and the monetary targets set at the National People's Congress suggested if anything that policy this year will be even less expansive than in 2024.

If you want to kill me, kill me, but you will not execute me like ISIS, were reportedly the words former hostage Tal Shoham told Hamas terrorists on October 7, according to his interview with Fox News released on Saturday. This marks his first interview since his return from Gaza last month. I raised my hands, but I refused to kneel, he added, relaying the moment when one of his captors took him from his car and pointed a rifle at him. I am not a victim. Even if this ends, I will end it with my head high, looking death in the eyes. They won't break me, and I will not surrender to self-pity. We are stronger than the other side. Shoham then described Palestinians filming him on their phones as he was being abducted by dozens of armed terrorists. When he arrived in Gaza, he was taken to a home of a family, where he spent the first month of his captivity. There, he was tortured and fed very limited amounts of food, but described the worst torment being the uncertainty as to whether his family was alive or not. He added that his isolation was worse than the hunger. Only after 34 days, hostages Evyatar David and Guy Gilboa-Dalal - who are still in captivity - were brought to the same house. He told Fox News that David and Gilboa-Dalal are his brothers, adding that he has difficulty sleeping at night while knowing their horrific condition. He also said that speaking was prohibited in captivity. Freed hostage Tal Shoham reunited with his family after his return from Gaza, February 22, 2025 (credit: IDF SPOKESPERSON'S UNIT) In June of last year, Shoham and the two others were moved to an underground tunnel in an ambulance that Hamas used to transport hostages, he told Fox News. There, the three met with Omer Wenkert, who was eventually released the same day as Shoham. In the tunnel there was a new guard who was extremely violent, Shoham described, saying He made some of us kneel like dogs and beat us. He would come in screaming that we were filthy Jews, hit us, and then 10 minutes later, he would smile and bring food. Details of Shoham's captivity Shoham spent 505 days in captivity in the Gaza Strip before being finally released on February 22, 2025. He has Austrian and Italian citizenship. He was abducted with eight other members of his extended family, including his wife and children who were released in the first hostage deal in November 2023. He was released alongside Wenkert, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen, Avera Mengistu, Hisham Al-Sayed - with the last two having been hostages held by the terrorist organization for years. On the day that Shoham was released, Hamas forced David and Gilboa-Dalal to watch as the other hostages were released, posting this in a video on their Telegram channel. The video, which the two hostages' families have approved for distribution, showed the the two in the back of a car very close to the stage where the release ceremony for Shem Tov, Wenkert, and Cohen. Shoham was released in Rafah alongside Mengistu, and he was forced to make a speech on Hamas's makeshift stage before being handed to the Red Cross. He was discharged from Rabin Medical Center five days after his release. He lost about 64 pounds during his captivity. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Around a week later, he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for two hours, where he also described his time in captivity to the Israeli leader, and, like in the Fox News interview, spoke in particular of the plight of hostages David and Gilboa-Dalal.|2025-03-16|https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-846190

Macron says will announce plans to 'mobilise civilians' Paris, March 15 (AFP) Mar 15, 2025 French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday ruled out bringing back mandatory military service but said he wanted to mobilise society in the face of Russian aggression and would make an announcement in the coming weeks. Speaking to regional newspapers in comments recorded Friday and published Saturday, Macron said the return of compulsory military service was not a realistic option. He said France no longer had the logistics to reintroduce conscription, which ended in 2001. We are going to look at ways to mobilise civilians, Macron told the regional press, adding that he wanted to consolidate the mobilisation of society in the face of crises. European countries including France have been debating reinstating compulsory military service to boost their defences in the face of Russian aggression. Fears about the strength of NATO have surged further after US President Donald Trump said Europe must take care of its own security. According to a recent poll, 61 percent of French people are in favour of re-establishing some form of compulsory military service. During his presidential campaign in 2017, Macron had promised to introduce a month-long compulsory service, but the idea received a cool response from the army. Macron has been looking for ways to encourage young French people to serve. In January, he asked the government and the army to submit proposals by May on how to mobilise more young volunteers to back up the armed forces in case of need. Former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, speaking to Le Figaro, proposed creating a voluntary military service , which would enable at least 50,000 men and women to be trained each year. Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu has suggested strengthening a reserve force to 100,000 people.|2025-03-16|https://www.spacewar.com/afp/250315205509.tkda84yn.html
Tom Jolliffe looks at 13 underrated franchise horror sequels that deserve more love… Franchise horror rule of thumb generally goes like this: the first film is a trailblazing classic. The sequels increasingly diminish in quality. Some franchises might well have die hard fans, but it can often be the case that those classic originals such as Halloween or A Nightmare on Elm Street are the only ones general fans will give the time of day. Why it works out this way is largely down to a couple of factors. They're usually a simple retread that lacks the definitive punch of the first, or step too far away from the successful formula alienating the people who loved the first. Sometimes it's simply a case that a special filmmaker is at the helm of the original, but doesn't return for the sequels. See the likes of Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven, and William Friedkin who all started the ball rolling with iconic horror films, only for 'lesser' directors to take the helm for sequels. Still, there are an array of critically savaged sequels that have perhaps been unfairly tarnished. Some have attracted a little more love in time. Let's look at 13 unlucky and underrated horror sequels that deserve more love… A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge Franchise 'rules.' It's a contentious aspect of franchise cinema, particularly when the first film is the standout masterpiece. Does this mean that every rule set within a classic original should be carved in stone, immovable? A fan's expectation gets immediately set with film one. So when a first sequel comes along and tears out a few pages of the rule book, it's inevitable that some fans will bite back. That's exactly what happened with Jack Sholder's A Nightmare On Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge. In years since it has taken on a cult life form all of its own, whilst slowly gathering more fans. It's also been adopted as an entry into Queer cinema. There are very distinct and direct metaphors within the film concerning homosexuality, whilst others have read a link to the AIDS 'epidemic' which was beginning to permeate the media back then. Still, despite Freddy becoming more of a possessive spirit the protagonist Jessie has to fight off, and the dream stalker eventually coming out into reality by taking over Jessie, this film has some interesting psychological horror. It's also perhaps the most discomfortingly atmospheric film in the franchise. The original was of course persistently unsettling, a great example of nightmarish cinema, but Freddy's Revenge just feels clammy, constantly searing, hot, and uncomfortable. Set during a heatwave, the audience is made to feel grimly sweaty from high temperatures, steamy shower rooms, relentlessly humid nights, and sweltering boiler rooms. It has become a cult movie but still deserves more praise, not only as a decent horror sequel but as an unsettling, clammy psychological horror with probably the best Freddy design. Friday the 13th VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Time for something potentially controversial. I was never a big fan of the original Friday the 13th. It doesn't hold a candle to Halloween. It took a while for the franchise to find its feet as far as having an 'icon' when Jason finally donned the immortal Hockey mask. The bar wasn't really set too high, even if the first film had some stylistic choices which were a little ahead of the curve. That being said, I enjoy Jason's escapades and actually have a little more fondness for the tail end of the OG series, when things got just a little bit more gonzo. I enjoy aspects of Jason Goes to Hell, I enjoy Jason X for the concept, even if it's not quite as inventive as it could be. However, my underrated pick is Jason Takes Manhattan. Jason on a Cruise Ship, then Jason stalking disposable cast through Manhattan. It's full of great images and loads of cheesy moments. It's more popular nowadays given there's more audience predisposition for gonzo ideas, but that trilogy of 'enders' between VIII and X for the franchise which never knew when to end, have an enjoyably goofy quality and Jason in Manhattan is the pick of the bunch. Predator 2 Predator 2 does have its fans, some of which are apologists who enjoy it in spite of glaring flaws, but the film is certainly undervalued. When Nimrod Antal made Predators, his slightly tired throwback to the original was dubbed the best sequel and then quickly forgotten. Then we recently had Prey which is an unofficial prequel/sequel, also frequently dubbed the best since the original. Prey is decent to be fair, but it's a little forgettable. For me, if Jason traipsing Manhattan was an interesting visual, then a Predator hunting Danny Glover in L.A, during a heatwave, is also unforgettable. Glover makes a suitably world-weary hero trying to deal with a spate of gruesome murders and gang warfare, who of course discovers something else entirely. He's got great support from Gary Busey and Bill Paxton, whilst Stephen Hopkins' film looks fantastic. The sweaty visuals and predominantly night shoots create plenty of atmosphere. Predator is far and away the Don of the franchise, but for me, Predator 2 lives up to its number. It comes second. Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers The Halloween franchise is a bit of an odd one. The second film, which I love, effectively kicks off right after the first. It was received reasonably well by fans, even if many felt it lacked the assured direction of Carpenter. Then the third film took a decidedly left-of-field turn, doing away with Michael Myers entirely and trying to take the series into something more eclectically episodic. The fourth entry went back to Myers having riled fans. In truth, the fourth film is also underrated and is part of what's a very definite two-hander that culminates with Halloween 5. Myers awakes from a coma in 4, goes on the hunt for a previously unmentioned niece, and gets dealt with. He comes back in 5 for revenge. As an overall horror, the fourth film nails more landings and is more effective, but one key reason I prefer the fifth is because of the character arc for Jamie (Danielle Harris). Suffering PTSD from her prior encounter with Uncle Mike, she's housed in a psychiatric unit, and struggling against the same DNA that has turned her unc into a maniacal killer. Harris was excellent in the fourth but she's even better here. It's quite a dark role for such a young actress at the time, pretty harrowing and she's put through the wringer. Inevitably no one believes her when she thinks Myers is back on the scene. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is never far behind. That struggle to fight back a killer instinct that has afflicted Myers and a feeling of inevitability at having to face him once more really drives Jamie to the point of insanity and Harris is phenomenal. Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth Hellraiser was a completely unique entity in horror. This bizarre, gruesome, gothic psycho-sexual film had a lot of interesting elements. It's one of a kind, and it became pretty apparent that the film's most iconic image would be that of Pinhead. As head of the cenobites his part in the first was in actuality small, as a creature of hell luring unsuspecting flesh to be torn apart. He would become the most memorable facet of it, not least for that unforgettable makeup adorned on Doug Bradley. The sequels would inevitably seek to delver a little further into the Pinhead mythos and the hell that exists parallel to our reality (opened by the lament configuration cube). The first sequel was fantastical and opened an intriguing and interesting glimpse into the hell Pinhead exists within and would hint at his back story, complete with stunning visuals. Hellraiser 3: Hell on Earth then elaborates further still, and opens up the concept of hell being brought to Earth. If there's one thing that has held the franchise back, beyond the first, it's been that the protagonists have not been nearly as interesting as the enigmatic villain and his cohorts. It's the same in Hellbound and indeed in Hell on Earth, yet this one, despite the antipathy toward it, is pretty good fun. There's a sense that Pinhead was starting to border on the same transition Freddy Kruger took. He's a bit more comical and that inevitably alienated some fans. Still, this has some fun moments, some great visuals, and brilliant visual effects. Anthony Hickox brings a bit of whimsical flair which made his Waxwork films so enjoyable. Psycho III Alfred Hitchcock reinvented cinema with Psycho. It was groundbreaking in Hollywood, shocking not only for its subject and certain scenes (like the infamous shower scene) but also for its second act shocker in killing off the protagonist Janet Leigh. More twists would follow but it shocked and surprised audiences and was not long after, considered a masterpiece. A growing group of aspiring auteurs were hugely inspired by Hitch's most rug-pulling film. It feels odd the film would turn into a franchise but that's what happened. By the time Perkins revisited the role that broke him out, he was in something of a career slump. Such a brilliant actor, capable of such nuance which he showed in the first film, just never seemed to be able to shake off Norman Bates. With a slump coming to his senior years in the early 80s, he went back to Bates Motel, and whilst finances would have been a key motivator, Perkins wasn't content to phone it in. Though he played Bates broader, a little more theatrically, he delivers an intriguing performance in the second and once again in the third. This wasn't held in too high a regard but Psycho III has plenty of great moments. Perkins is excellent too, whilst the film's cast (including a young Jeff Fahey) keeps things engaging. No, it was never going to be a patch on the original, but what is? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was genre-defining. It was a rough, ragged, but incredibly styled indie horror that tore up the rule book and laid foundations for an array of young horror filmmakers to shoot films for peanuts. They benefitted further from the VHS era, but those humble anti-establishment beginnings for a new wave of horror began with Tobe Hooper's original. It might seem surprising then, that whilst Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street all came after (and had sequels sooner), a follow-up to Hooper's classic took so long. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 came in 1986 and we have Cannon to thank. They'd already lured Hooper over to become with of their preeminent directors. Dennis Hopper was brought in to provide a star name to proceedings, and though there were elements of macabre comedy in the original, the tonal shift in this first sequel still came as a surprise to many. Critics hated it. Fans didn't like it much better either until it grew in popularity for its gonzo elements more recently. None of the sequels were initially given much credence, but this second one is certainly underappreciated and too few have caught onto it yet. Halloween III: Season of the Witch Ah yes, the aforementioned and divisive sequel which veered wildly away from the franchise and did away with Michael Myers entirely. Season of the Witch, like the second, didn't have Carpenter at the helm but still had his DNA on it, not least because he contributes to the score. Oddly this film feels more like a companion piece to They Live than Halloween with a doctor (Tom Atkins) and the daughter of his old buddy uncovering a plot by a mask manufacturer to brainwash the nation into committing violent acts. It's easy to see why this pissed off fans, but at the same time, scratch off the Halloween title, and this certainly stands on its own two feet. Though the film ventures into an oddly icky love side plot between Atkins and the much younger Stacey Nelkin, it's an enjoyably Twilight Zone-esque feature that culminates in a memorable finale. The Carpenter score and Dean Cundey cinematography certainly add to the production value and Atkins is always good. Cube 2: Hypercube Cube was a barnstorming indie sci-fi that came out of the blue and quickly became a cult favourite. It spawned two sequels and more recently a Japanese reboot. The first sequel certainly didn't impact the genre as much as its original, but it proved popular. This is one of those examples of a sequel that heavily retreads the beats of the first, largely opting to up the scale and the ante a bit. Hypercube might not manage to enthrall like the original, and though it seeks to elaborate on some of the teasing enigmas of the first, this still retains enough mystery (whereas Cube Zero, which followed, though enjoyable, probably had too many mysteries unearthed). We're largely here for the horror and the slowly dwindling participants being offed by booby traps, trying to figure out how to escape. It feels clearer and brighter than the first, so it at least has some visual variation, and Kari Matchett is very good. Wes Craven's New Nightmare Wes Craven's first stab at meta-horror saw him revisit his most famous creation, bring his entire legacy into the real world, and cast his original Nancy, Heather Langenkamp, as herself. A maniacal demon takes on the form of Kruger to torment Nancy. Along the way, she interacts with Craven (as himself) and Robert Englund (Freddy's eponymous actor as himself). As well as being a good dissection of horror fandom and his own place within pop culture, Craven never forgets that at the core this still needs to be a horror film. Langenkamp comes with a maturity brought on by time and experience and adds interesting layers as the protagonist, particularly in comparison to her very youthful turn in the original. She's superb, but for whatever reason New Nightmare didn't quite pull in the audience it deserved. Despite good reviews, this one just seemed to get forgotten too quickly, largely because two years later Craven pastiched the slasher genre with Scream which would end up galvanizing an entire sub-genre. For a year, Scream was the talk of the town and the hip horror of the era. Even now, too few people seem to appreciate just how good New Nightmare was/is. That is a shame. Additionally, Englund's performance as a more demonic Kruger is as chilling as he's ever been in the role, largely scraping out all the comedy (which, though mild, still permeated the original at times). Alien 3 David Fincher's feature debut does legacy smashing in a way that seems to be in vogue now. He starts the film by unceremoniously binning Hicks and Newt, who survived James Cameron's epically grandiose sci-fi actioner Aliens. If that film was near genre perfection, Alien 3 is a film marred by a clash between dollar-counting producers and an upstart direct not quite able to control a potentially damaging need to be noticed immediately. His vision, the best and worst of it, was certainly tempered by the theatrical cut. That said, whilst some fans piss steam at the very thought of Alien 3, others can see glimpses into the future brilliance of Fincher, and others appreciate a diversion back to more straight horror orientation. Once you get over the rug-pulling opening and we're reintroduced to Ripley (who bless her, just can't seem to shake these Xenomorph encounters) the film has a nice atmosphere-building opening and a solid cast of British actors. That said, Charles Dance is a great presence in this and he dies a little too early. The reintroduction of Lance Henriksen feels a little fridge nukey, and it never quite nails the finale, but…but…there's still enough to love about this, and on a technical level, it's brilliantly made. The Exorcist III The original film, based on William Peter Blatty's novel, quickly became a part of cinema history. Genuinely unsettling and unlike anything previously seen in cinemas, surviving a screening of the frightening film became a challenge many audiences were willing to take, often by curiosity as much as anything. Urban legend grew very quickly after release with stories of people dying of heart attacks during screenings, or stories of a cursed production. Still, William Friedkin created a masterpiece…Then came the sequel The Heretic, still considered by many to be one of the worst films ever made. It was most certainly misguided, but not quite that bad. The Exorcist III fared better with fans and critics, though still divisive. Blatty came on board to not only write but direct too. The key ingredient that is added back into this film, lacking from the unintentionally laughable previous, is the atmosphere and scares. I recall seeing the trailer on VHS, a preview before the main event (I can't even remember which film the trailer preceded). Even the trailer gave me the creeps. The Exorcist III is certainly still flawed and is still more overblown than it probably needs to be, but it's enjoyably grandiose with some nerve-jangling moments. The cast is great, with Jason Miller returning, and George C. Scott and Brad Dourif also providing great performances. It isn't as interesting a treatise on religion, and good versus evil as the original, but it's laden with tension, holy shit moments and enough creepiness to have you watching from behind the sofa. Freddy vs Jason Two icons unite. There were two schools of thinking. That it's either better than it had a right to be, or it's not nearly as good as it could have been. Likewise, a leaning into comedy, particularly as you'd expect from Kruger's side of things, was a bit too much for some. It was a hit and it was supposed to trigger a wave of additional versus movies. Freddy vs Jason vs Ash. Occasionally Pinhead and Myers were put in the lineup, at least by fans hoping for more matchups. Could this have been taken more seriously? I don't think so. It's an inherently silly idea. They don't get too smug about it, or venture too far into spoof and lose sincerity, but it's definitely played as more fun than scary. The combination of two horror icons together only emphasizes that Jason was just never as interesting as Freddy. He's the big, masked, silent brute, but Myers had that down, with a bit more intrigue and enigma. Plus, I've always enjoyed Jason's sillier fare as aforementioned. Englund revels in this final fling as Kruger. He steals the film. The mortal cast of attractive young people? Well, they're pretty disposable and forgettable, although Monica Keena, a potential scream Queen back around that era, is decent. It's stylish, thanks to Ronny Yu's direction and it's a lot of fun. It feels like this one should be held in higher regard with fans, though I'm not sure Jason's fans were ever too enamored with it.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/13-underrated-horror-franchise-sequels-that-deserve-more-love/

Former President Donald Trump said Wednesday there were big threats on his life posed by Iran after the Republican presidential candidate's campaign team said US intelligence warned him of real and specific threats from Tehran, AFP reported. Big threats on my life by Iran. The entire U.S. Military is watching and waiting, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. Moves were already made by Iran that didn't work out, but they will try again. ... I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before. His campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said in a statement on Tuesday that Trump was warned by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States . Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months, Cheung said.|2025-03-16|https://www.panorama.am/en/news/2025/03/16

The death toll rose after Kansas Highway Patrol said on Saturday that eight people had died after a dust storm caused at least 50 vehicles to crash on an interstate road in Sherman County. Missouri recorded more fatalities than any other US state as it withstood scattered twisters overnight that killed at least 12 people, authorities said. The deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. Overturned truck / Tornadoes caused havoc in Missouri (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP) Describing the scene that confronted rescuers, Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County said: It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Officials in Arkansas said three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state. Arkansas governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X: We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist. She and Georgia governor Brian Kemp declared states of emergency. Mr Kemp said he was making the declaration in anticipation of severe weather moving in later on Saturday. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle. The deaths came as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires. Extreme weather conditions were forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80mph were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier places to the south. The US National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early on Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3-6in were expected, with up to a foot possible. Winds gusting to 60mph were expected to cause whiteout conditions. The Storm Prediction Centre said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs on Saturday, but the greatest threat would come from winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100mph possible. Significant tornadoes continued to strike on Saturday. The regions at highest risk stretch from eastern Louisiana and Mississippi through Alabama, western Georgia and the Florida panhandle, forecasters said.|2025-03-16|https://www.wiltshiretimes.co.uk/news/national/25011441.deadly-storm-pummels-central-southern-us/
GAZA CITY, Palestine Palestinian Civil Defense teams continued efforts Saturday to retrieve the bodies of 61 Palestinians buried in the yard of Gaza's Shifa Hospital during Israel's months-long war. The Gaza Health Ministry said the exhumation process began on March 13, 2025, as teams worked to recover remains for proper burial. On the first day, Civil Defense workers retrieved 48 bodies, including 10 unidentified individuals. On the second day, they recovered 13 more bodies, three of which remain unidentified. Known bodies were returned to families, while others were sent to forensic authorities. Authorities estimate around 160 bodies were buried in the hospital's yard during the war, with several more days needed to complete the recovery process. Shifa Hospital, once Gaza's largest medical facility, served 460,000 people annually before the war, providing emergency care, surgeries, dialysis treatments, and maternal health services. Israeli forces repeatedly stormed and destroyed Shifa Hospital throughout the war. Their first major raid occurred on Nov. 16, 2023, lasting 10 days. A second incursion on March 18, 2024, continued until April 1, during which Israeli troops demolished hospital sections, burned buildings, and carried out killings inside and around the facility, rendering it completely inoperable. Munir Al-Barsh, Director-General of Gaza's Health Ministry, told Anadolu in January 2025 that over 95% of the hospital's buildings and equipment were destroyed during Israel's genocidal war. A ceasefire and prisoner exchange deal has been in effect since Jan. 19, halting Israel's brutal assault, which killed over 48,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and left Gaza in ruins.|2025-03-16|https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/palestinian-civil-defense-teams-recover-61-bodies-from-shifa-hospital-yard-in-gaza/3510623
ISTANBUL SpaceX successfully launched its Crew-10 mission on Friday, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS) and paving the way for the return of two NASA astronauts stranded for months due to issues with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off at 7:03 p.m. local time (2303GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, carrying NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan's Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov to the ISS. The mission temporarily increases the ISS crew to 11 and will support new research aimed at advancing human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Critically, the launch also sets the stage for the long-awaited return of NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, who have been stuck on the ISS since June 2024 due to technical problems with Boeing's Starliner spacecraft. Following a short handover period, Williams, Wilmore, and two other crew members are expected to return to Earth as early as Wednesday. This milestone demonstrates NASA's continued commitment to advancing American leadership in space and driving growth in our national space economy, said NASA acting Administrator Janet Petro, praising the launch. The mission, originally planned for March 12, was delayed due to a hydraulic issue with ground support equipment. The successful liftoff marks SpaceX's 10th operational human spaceflight mission, further solidifying its role as a leader in commercial space travel.|2025-03-16|https://www.aa.com.tr/en/science-technology/spacex-launches-mission-to-bring-stranded-nasa-astronauts-home-after-nine-month-iss-stay/3510612
EJ Moreno looks at five Marvel movie what ifs? … Like every franchise or studio, Marvel has seen their fair share of films enter development and never see a release. Whether it's a passion project rejected by studio heads or just a long developmental process that scares off a lead, we've seen plenty of projects based on the most popular Marvel characters halted before they started. For this list, we'll look at five of the biggest What Ifs in Marvel movies. To be included here, the films must have at least a writer or director attached and have a chance of getting made. No shade to Bruce Timm, but no one believed the JLA/Avengers film would happen. Be sure to tell us what unproduced film projects based on Marvel Comics stick out to you the most… Edgar Wright's Ant-Man Till recently, most filmmakers and fans had nothing but praise about their Marvel experience. But a moment early into the MCU's run had everyone a bit concerned for the future of their films. One of the biggest scandals in early Marvel Studios history is Edgar Wright leaving his Ant-Man passion project after creative differences. It began in 2003 when Wright expressed interest and lasted past his meeting with Stan Lee in 2010; the Cornetto trilogy was all set to tackle the Marvel character. Pre-production began in 2013 before its 2015 release, and production entered the great Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Paul Rudd debate, which started the bumpy road between Wright and Marvel. By mid-2014, Edgar Wright was off, and director Peyton Reed took over. Wright's plans for the Ant-Man project sounded great, with the filmmaker adding his signature flair to some deep comic lore. But as Wright put it at the time: I wanted to make a Marvel movie, but I don't think they really wanted to make an Edgar Wright movie. Check out more details about this project below… ﻿ X-Men: Origins – Magneto In the early 00s, X-Men movies were all the rage in the comic book world. With Spider-Man joining the mix and DC taking a break after a rough 90s, it was time for Marvel to take its place at the top. We had a few years of mutant dominance, but it soon ran dry when we hit the X-Men Origins era in the mid-00s. When X-Men Origins: Wolverine was brewing, Fox was looking to dive into more of the iconic mutants backstories, with Ian McKellan's Magneto as a focal point for another spin-off. In 2004, there was some talk of Magneto film, described as The Pianist meets X-Men, which never came to fruition. By 2006, David S. Goyer joined and began re-working things, which moved the film out of 40's Germany and into 60's America. With delays and some mixed reactions to X-Men projects, Ian McKellan stepped away from the project, and this spin-off of a '60s X-Men movie would morph into the plot of X-Men: First Class. Sadly, we didn't see Magneto face off with Mister Sinister as initially planned. Guillermo del Toro's Doctor Strange We could be here for years talking about canceled or developmental hell projects from the great Guillermo del Toro. No filmmaker has touched more projects that have never seen the light of day, and it's a damn shame when you think we could've seen the magical and twisted world of Guillermo del Toro meets The Sorcerer Supreme. In 2007, the Pan's Labyrinth filmmaker began the development of a Doctor Strange movie right before the MCU started with Iron Man in 2008. As the legend goes, Marvel approached Neil Gaiman about penning a Doctor Strange film, which led Gaiman to bring in del Toro. Shortly after that, Marvel told the filmmakers that the film was too far out, and they viewed Strange as too much of a minor character at the time. Things have changed with Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange character, a massive part of the modern-day MCU. Little was known about the film, but Gaiman teased that he and Guillermo planned on using Clea, who just made her debut, played by Charlize Theron. Silver Surfer You have to give some credit to Fox Studios' Fantastic Four films; for the time, they offered up a comics-accurate take on the iconic family, which seemingly seems impossible to do. One of the things the studio and filmmaker Tim Story got near perfect was Silver Surfer, even if he had to deal with the insane dud that was the 2007 version of Galactus. J. Michael Straczynski was attached to write a spin-off, giving Doug Jones' take on the Silver Surfer an origin story. There were plans to address the Galactus Cloud, with Story saying the version we saw in Rise of the Silver Surfer allowed the future spin-off film to be unique as the character had yet to appear in comic-book form. But even back then, Straczynski doubted we'd see the movie. He'd be proven right, given by the 2010s, little development had happened in the film. Writer Brian K. Vaughan was later brought on to make his own Silver Surfer movie in 2018, but Marvel Studios/Disney would soon buy Fox, and the rest is history. Spider-Man 4 Along with the Fox Studios' X-Men movies, the Sony Spider-Man films from Sam Raimi were all the rage in the 00s. We couldn't get enough of Spider-Man as the first two films won over audiences. Then Spider-Man 3 hit, and things got a bit murky. But Raimi didn't give up hope with the odd fan reaction as he began to develop a fourth Spider-Man. By 2009, Sam Raimi was still attached to direct, and Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and other cast members were all set to reprise their roles. Rumors swirled on which villain would be introduced, with everything from The Lizard to John Malkovich as Vulture taking shape. In 2010, Sony Pictured announced Raimi was off the project, and we soon saw the Amazing reboot in 2012. Sam Raimi would return to Marvel years later for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, while Tobey Maguire got another shot in the hit film Spider-Man: No Way Home. Both these MCU moments they had also fueled another round of Spider-Man 4 rumors. Check out more details about this project below… ﻿ Still to this day, Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures have announced projects and dragged their feet or left them in developmental hell. But no films will have hit the biggest what could've been more than these.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/what-if-five-marvel-movies-that-were-almost-made/
A resurfaced clip from a 2022 episode of Shark Tank has ignited controversy after viewers noticed eerie similarities between guest shark Kevin Hart's reaction to a plant-based-chicken restaurant pitch and his subsequent launch of a nearly identical concept months later. In season 13, episode 24, entrepreneur Lucas Bradbury presented his vegan chicken fast-food chain, Project Pollo, seeking $2.5 million for 5 percent of his rapidly expanding business. Kevin Hart's resurfaced appearance on Shark Tank has fans wondering if he stole a contestant's pitch for his restaurant. (Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images) In 2025, Bradbury's pitch caught attention not only for its ambitious valuation but, also for Hart's response — followed by his launch of a suspiciously similar concept later that same year. The timing has left many viewers questioning whether the comedian's appearance on the show was merely a reconnaissance mission for his own business venture, especially given the striking similarities in both concept and menu offerings. Did Kevin hart get his idea to make his restaurant after this? one YouTube commenter wrote in the Shark Tank Global channel. Another directly questioned, Why was Kevin Hart ever on this show? If he can't catch up with what's going on then he shouldn't be a shark. During the pitch, Bradbury showcased his plant-based chicken sandwiches, nuggets, and buffalo mac and cheese, impressing the sharks with the taste. Shark Tank judge Kevin O'Leary even declared, I've tried a lot of fake chicken, this is the best I've had. Despite the praise for the food, all sharks, including Hart, rejected the deal. While most cited concerns about the rapid expansion and high valuation, Hart specifically mentioned the pace being too risky, I think it's too much of a risk, especially for what you're asking … so, for that reason I'm out. What viewers found suspicious was Hart's launch of Hart House — a vegan fast-food chain featuring remarkably similar menu items including plant-based chicken sandwiches and nuggets — mere months after the episode aired. The timing raised eyebrows among fans, with one commenter noting, I have more respect for the Pollo Project guy than Kevin Hart. He [Bradbury] actually busted his tail to get where he is at. Shark Barbara Corcoran had warned Bradbury during his pitch about expanding too quickly, comparing Project Pollo to Tom and Chee, another business Shark Tank judges invested in that lost everything after rapid expansion. The idea that you're moving so fast… I wouldn't be able to go to bed at night and sleep, Corcoran said before declining to invest. Her concerns proved prescient. Project Pollo's aggressive growth strategy ultimately led to its downfall. After opening 12 locations in rapid succession, the company faced operational challenges and eventually closed all stores, with Bradbury selling the business to a national franchise group in April 2023, according to the Daily Meal. Ironically, Hart's venture suffered a nearly identical fate. Hart House opened four locations across Los Angeles County before abruptly shuttering all restaurants in early 2024, lasting just under two years. While Hart told The Hollywood Reporter in August 2022 that he wanted to give people a plant-based option in the fast-food landscape, customer reviews suggested product issues doomed the business. Social media reviews described Hart House offerings as awful and tasted like cardboard, while others complained the food was unbelievably greasy and flavorless — criticisms that likely contributed to its closure. The parallel failures highlight the challenges facing plant-based fast-food concepts despite their trendiness. Shark Mark Cuban foresaw these difficulties during Bradbury's pitch, stating, Plant-based does not mean healthy. … There's nothing healthy about what you're doing. … I think over the next two to three years it's going to go the opposite direction where plant-based and healthy have to go together. Shark Lori Greiner had also expressed concern about Bradbury's aggressive expansion, comparing him to a tornado and questioning what happens when that touches down. Both Project Pollo and Hart House ultimately confirmed these predictions, collapsing under similar pressures of rapid expansion and product-market fit challenges. One YouTube commenter lamented the failures, writing, Kevin Hart closed down his plant-based fast food restaurant 'Hart House' which I tried in Los Angeles. It's such a bummer the world is so indoctrinated to thinking you need to eat meat to survive. 10+ years vegan and never going back.

China is expecting air passenger travel to hit a record in 2024, bouncing past pre-pandemic levels. Passenger flights may reach 700 million this year, Song Zhiyong, head of the Civil Aviation Administration, said Tuesday at the Asia Pacific Summit for Aviation Safety, according to China's State Council. In the first half of this year, total passenger trips rose nine percent from the same period in 2019, the State Council added, signaling that China's air travel sector has rebounded from the pandemic. The country's projection for 2024 comes in higher than the 619.6 million air passenger trips seen in 2023, according to data released in June by Chinese officials. During the eight-day Lunar New Year holidays earlier this year, tourism revenues in China surged by 47.4% year-on-year, driven by a domestic travel boom, beating pre-pandemic levels. International travel across the country recently got a boost from the Paris Olympic Games, and demand for flights to and from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Europe has been particularly strong, a CAAC official told Chinese state media. Meanwhile, the broader Asia-Pacific region's travel sector has seen growth this year thanks to Chinese tourists.|2025-03-16|https://balticbusinessnews.com/china-expects-air-travel-to-hit-a-record-in-2024/
Wikimedia Commons/ Phil Roeder from Des Moines, Iowa Washington Gov. Jay Inslee / Wikimedia Commons/ Phil Roeder from Des Moines, Iowa Washington Gov. Jay Inslee A federal appeals court has ruled that a church cannot sue Washington state over a law that requires most employers to have healthcare insurance plans that cover abortions. A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 last Thursday against a lawsuit brought by Cedar Park Assembly of God of Kirkland against former Gov. Jay Inslee and Washington Insurance Commissioner Myron Kreidler over Washington's Reproductive Parity Act. Circuit Judge Susan Graber, a Clinton appointee, authored the majority opinion, writing that the church lacked the standing to sue because Washington's conscientious objection statute exempts employers like Plaintiff from the consequences of the mandate. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. Washington's conscientious-objection statute and regulations operate to make Plaintiff's desired no-abortion group health coverage possible, wrote Graber. Nothing in the challenged law prevents any insurance company, including Kaiser, from offering Plaintiff a health plan that excludes direct coverage for abortion services. Graber concluded, Washington's statutes and implementing regulation enable insurance carriers to provide exactly the sort of coverage that Plaintiff requires. Plaintiff contends, in the alternative, that an employer purchasing a no-abortion plan in Washington still 'indirectly facilitates' the provision of abortion services to its employees, she continued. The general disapproval of the actions that others might decide to take does not create standing, even when some tenuous connection may exist between the disapproving plaintiff and the offense-causing action. Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, a George W. Bush appointee, authored a dissenting opinion, writing that while Cedar Park can choose to not purchase abortion coverage for its 'benefits package,' it must still enter into a contract with an insurer for a 'health plan' that provides coverage of abortions. Callahan took issue with the majority's claim that Cedar Park had two viable options for coverage that would have excluded the requirement to cover abortions. Cedar Park is not eligible for these two plans, and the church submitted a declaration attesting to the fact that it cannot procure a health plan excluding abortion coverage that is comparable to the one it received from Kaiser Permanente, she added. The majority says that insurers can offer Cedar Park a health plan that excluding abortion coverage. But how? The majority doesn't tell us, and its conclusion flies in the face of the plain language of the Parity Act. In March 2018, Inslee signed Senate Bill 6219. Also known as the Parity Act, the new law required employer healthcare plans that covered maternity care to include abortion coverage. The church filed its complaint in federal court in March 2019, with Judge Benjamin Settle, a George W. Bush appointee, dismissing the lawsuit in May 2021. In July 2021, a 9th Circuit panel consisting of three George W. Bush appointees revived Cedar Park's lawsuit, issuing a unanimous decision that the church had plausibly alleged that the law forced the church's health insurer to stop offering a plan with abortion coverage restrictions. The panel sent the case back to the district court level, where Judge Benjamin Settle of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled against the church in July 2023, concluding that the law was neutral and related to a legitimate governmental purpose.

Steve Grace and Kirra Daley's Beachtree Distillery is among Australia's most awarded. Photo: HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY Steve Grace and Kirra Daley's Beachtree Distillery is among Australia's most awarded. Photo: HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY It was a conversation over a few drinks that sparked the inception of Beachtree Distillery and owners Kirra Daley and Steve Grace to take the leap from their day jobs to business owners. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading Standing proudly in Caloundra, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, the organic distillery is now among Australia's most awarded. But the story of the First Nations-owned business begins well before the conversation that set the plans in motion. Ms Daley's father is a farmer, particularly interested in native plants, while her mother made sure to connect her to her Italian roots through winemaking and distilling. These traditions, combined with local, organic ingredients became a core passion. I was taught growing up that when you have a native it should be pure, you don't want to mix up chemicals or preservatives and things like that, the Bundjalung woman told AAP. Mr Grace's passion began with playing around with native ingredients out bush . With a background in engineering distilling equipment and using a process that is unique, the Kamilaroi man admits he's a perfectionist with each batch. I am very passionate about it, says the master distiller. The end result? It's me, it's mine and it represents me and us. I believe it has to be perfect. Beachtree brings together the pair's long-held passions for their traditions and love of ingredients from Australian soil. Even the name Beachtree is inspired by its location and the history that goes with it. The meaning of Caloundra in the local Kabi Kabi language is 'place of beech trees', so Beachtree is a nod to those roots. Each bottle adds to the distillery's story and pays homage to the past. I bring the influence of a 65,000 year heritage, Mr Grace said. Without the ancestors backing me, I wouldn't be able to do what I do. Master distiller Steve Grace is a self-described perfectionist.

(HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY) Over the years Ms Daley said she's learned to trust the master distiller's instincts. With a number of his handcrafted drops winning gold at the World Gin Awards, World Wine and Spirits competition and World Vodka Awards, Mr Grace has certainly earned this trust. Beachtree was also named craft producer of the year at the 2024 Icons of Gin Awards. But the journey hasn't always been easy for the small First Nations-owned business in a tough industry . The pair established Beachtree in 2020, with Ms Daley describing what came next as a rollercoaster , with COVID-19 lockdowns and 2022 floods disrupting the operation. They invested everything in the business, staying with family while the distillery found its feet. Sometimes I look back on those moments and think, 'what was I thinking', she said. But if we hadn't done it ... we'd probably be sitting there going 'what would have happened if we'd started that business we talked about over drinks'.

(Image: Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images) Ben Cohen's former wife, Abby Cohen, has made scathing comments following his breakup with Kristina Rihanoff. In the wake of their separation in 2014 and Ben's subsequent romance with dancer Kristina Rihanoff—whom he met on BBC's Strictly Come Dancing—Abby was left devastated. ‌ Although Ben and Kristina got engaged in November 2022, they have since ended their engagement earlier this year. Financial troubles reportedly plagued the couple prior to their relationship's demise, as disclosed earlier this month. The situation is being referred to as the curse in reverse, a play on the notorious Strictly curse that typically involves celebrities forming romantic connections with their dance partners on the show. In a candid interview, Abby expressed her thoughts: I'm sad for Ben. Our marriage broke down and it's happening all over again to him, and he's got another child. He's got to start again from nothing, in his late forties. He's going from being so successful as a rugby player to [people] now reading of his business failures. ‌ Ben and Abby Cohen / (Image: Getty Images) She also remarked that she doesn't desire 'to make Ben look more stupid than he already does. '. The mother stated that hearing about Ben's newest separation reopened past sorrows and voiced her dismay that their daughters must 'relive the pain,' a sentiment further compounded by the daughter they have from Kristina's relationship with Ben. ‌ Abby has candidly shared that the Strictly soundtrack still triggers her PTSD. Despite residing in the same town as Kristina, she has made it clear that reconciliation is not on the cards. In a revealing chat with The Mail on Sunday, Abby described the stark contrast between them: We are total opposites. I'm a homemaker. I'm a family girl. I make stews and Sunday dinners, she explained. ‌ Expanding further on their differences, Abby said: I don't know if Kristina does that, but I don't think so. Me and Kristina are completely different. We look completely different. We like different things. She doesn't have any wellies, put it that way. She doesn't pick dog mess off the floor like I have to do every day. Previously, Abby didn't mince words, having referred to Kristina as that f*****g Russian, Yet, despite living in close proximity, their paths haven't crossed—not even when Ben and Abby's children have been shuttling between homes. Abby suspects that fate is intentionally preventing an encounter, safeguarding her from further emotional strain. (Image: PA) ‌ Meanwhile, a source revealed to The Sun the breadth of turmoil faced by the couple amidst financial struggles, indicating a separation was inevitable. They disclosed that the past six months has been hell for the duo, effectively dismantling the affection once shared. The source added: For the sake of their family, they have chosen to go forward as separate individuals. Those close to them who know them as a couple had hoped they would be able to work things out but for now it's over and it looks like there's no going back. ‌ During a candid chat with The Sun, Abby opened up about the dubious beginnings of Ben and Kristina's romance. She was quoted saying to the newspaper: How they met is not, in my opinion, a solid enough foundation because it was all about lust and was a physical thing. It wasn't an organic way to meet. Abby spoke wrenchingly about the toll her split took on her wellbeing, admitting: I was in a mess, I didn't want to be here any more. I was really poorly. I sought help and support. I was really sad for a long time. And in 2015, letting her feelings out, she declared: My husband, who I was with for 23 years, unconditionally loved and was completely loyal to in every respect, has left me for a f**king Russian dancer. The last two years have been the most traumatic thing to ever happen to me. He's done the dirty on me. I want people to know.

FBI warns Gmail, Outlook users about phishing campaigns, ransomware attacks Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, tech and others this year. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video LOS ANGELES — The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme. In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called Medusa actors — use a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid, the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets, the advisory said. At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer. Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.|2025-03-16|https://www.whas11.com/article/news/nation-world/fbi-warning-against-ransomware-emails/507-32ce7292-d403-4009-99a1-5bd048c56d13
Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.kmxt.org/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation
PTI New York/Washington US President Donald Trump criticised the high tariffs charged by India and other countries, terming them as very unfair and announced reciprocal tariffs from April 2 on nations that impose levies on American goods. Trump made these remarks in an address to the joint session of the Congress on Tuesday. If you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases, a rather large one, Trump said. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada — have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them, Trump said. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100 per cent. In February, Trump said his administration would soon impose reciprocal tariffs on countries such as India and China, reiterating what he had said during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US capital last month. Trump has made it clear to Prime Minister Modi that India will not be spared from Washington's reciprocal tariffs and emphasised that nobody can argue with me on tariff structure. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that; four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea. But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe, Trump said. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth, and we will not let that happen any longer, Trump said. Asserting that this system is not fair to the United States and never was, Trump said that reciprocal tariffs will kick in from April 2. Whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal, back and forth, Trump said amid applause from Republican lawmakers. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them. If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. There's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in their market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before, Trump said. He added that I did it with China, and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because it was so much money they couldn't do anything about it. He added that the US has very large deficits with both Mexico and Canada. But even more importantly, they have allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people, destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. They are in effect receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico of hundreds of billions of dollars. And the United States will not be doing that any longer. We are not going to do it any longer.|2025-03-16|https://www.navhindtimes.in/2025/03/06/worldnews/reciprocal-tariffs-against-india-to-kick-in-from-april-2-trump/

COLOMBO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- In Anuradhapura, a central Sri Lankan city, for Bandara Abeysinghe, how mango trees yield abundant fruits is a question. Abeysinghe is a local agricultural instructor responsible for Nochchiyagama, one of main mango-producing areas in Anuradhapura. Locals have long been cultivating mangoes but could not ensure stable yields. In 2023, a cooperation project was launched by China and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Sri Lanka, with Chinese agricultural experts lending a helping hand to Abeysinghe. In an orchard cultivated by the Chinese experts, Abeysinghe and local farmers learned how to plant mango trees with new techniques, from precise fertilization to pest control. The demonstration plot was copied in Sri Lanka. Thanks to the new techniques, tropical fruit cultivation experiments have been conducted, including mangoes, pineapples and bananas. The outcomes, combining Chinese agricultural techniques and local conditions, have been shared with hundreds of thousands of local farmers. Liu Yangyang, an expert from the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, said that the demonstration plots have been well-known for the benefits. With the new practical techniques, yields significantly increased, and costs were not high, Abeysinghe said. Last month, the cooperation project was reviewed and approved by FAO. Kapila Munasinghe from FAO praised the Chinese experts, saying that their efforts contributed to the livelihoods of Sri Lankan farmers. Moreover, China and Sri Lanka were exploring new areas of cooperation, including processing agricultural products. There is potential for agricultural cooperation between the two countries, said Sun Dequan, Chinese team leader of the project.|2025-03-16|https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/03/16/feature-sri-lankan-orchardists039-harvest-dreams-with-chinese-agricultural-techniques

A promotional digital flyer for Draggieland 2025. / Screenshot/YouTube/Draggieland A free speech group is suing Texas A&M University over its policy banning drag performances across its 11-campus university system. The lawsuit, filed by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) on March 5 in the Southern District of Texas, comes just days after the Texas A&M (TAM) System Board of Regents passed a resolution on Feb. 28 prohibiting such performances at campus event spaces. The Board of Regents' resolution, effective immediately, declares that drag shows — described as featuring male performers in exaggerated feminine attire, makeup or prosthetics — conflict with the university's educational mission and core value of respect. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. According to the document, such performances are inconsistent with [TAM's] mission and core values and, as such, special event venues will not be used for drag shows that involve biological males dressing in women's clothing, wearing exaggerated female makeup and/or exaggerated prosthetics meant to parody the female body type as well as events that involve sexualize, vulgar or lewd conduct and conduct that demeans women. The resolution also states that drag events are likely to create or contribute to a hostile environment for women contrary to (TAM) anti-discrimination policy and Title IX as these events often involve ... the mockery and objectification of women. At the center of the dispute is the Queer Empowerment Council (QEC), a coalition of student groups at Texas A&M University-College Station which organizes Draggieland, an annual drag competition set for March 27, where Texas performers vie for the title of King/Queen of Draggieland. First held in 2020 at the campus theater complex, the popular event regularly sells out the 750-seat Rudder Theatre at TAM, according to the lawsuit. In response to the board's resolution, the QEC released a statement condemning the decision. Drag is self-expression, drag is discovery, drag is empowerment, and no amount of censorship will silence us. The group says it is seeking alternative off-campus venues while processing refunds for ticket holders starting Monday. FIRE's lawsuit contends that the ban violates the First Amendment, accusing Texas A&M of viewpoint discrimination. Public universities can't shut down student expression simply because the administration doesn't like the 'ideology' or finds it 'demeaning,' said FIRE attorney Adam Steinbaugh. The complaint argues that the regents' justification — claiming drag shows offend or promote gender ideology — fails constitutional muster, as the First Amendment protects speech regardless of whether it offends or clashes with institutional values. In its statement, FIRE also dismissed the board's reference to a hostile environment under Title IX, noting that a single, ticketed drag show does not meet the Supreme Court's threshold for severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive conduct. The group warns that under TAM policy, even theatrical productions could be canceled. Even putting on an on-campus production of Shakespeare or 'Mrs. Doubtfire,' or taking part in powderpuff, could be banned at A&M if some hostile administrator thinks they 'promote gender ideology,' said FIRE senior attorney JT Morris. But if the First Amendment means anything, it's that the government can't silence ideologies they don't like, real or perceived. The fight over drag shows in the TAM system goes back to at least 2023, when West Texas A&M University President Walter Wendler cited the Bible and other religious texts to support his decision to cancel a planned drag show scheduled to take place on campus. At the time, Wendler compared his opposition to the drag show to not supporting blackface performances on campus, calling such displays wrong. I do not support any show, performance or artistic expression which denigrates others — in this case, women — for any reason, he added. Free speech group sues Texas A&M over decision to ban drag shows across university system Board of Regents resolution states drag involves 'mockery and objectification of women' By CP Staff, Monday, March 10, 2025 A promotional digital flyer for 'Draggieland 2025.' /|2025-03-16|https://www.christianpost.com:443/news/free-speech-group-sues-texas-am-over-decision-to-ban-drag-shows.html
Roger Stone told Newsmax on Saturday that the leftward lurch of many of the younger liberal representatives illustrates the fundamental change in the Democrat Party, adding that the party of John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman no longer exisists. Earlier in the day, it was reported that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is threatening to primary fellow New York Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, over his last-minute support of the Republican-backed continuing resolution. Stone said old-school corporate Democrats like Chuck Schumer are now vulnerable. Let me remind you that AOC defeated JoeCrowley — who was not only amember of Congress, but thehead of the Queens DemocratParty machine — to win herstate to begin with. So ifshe is serious aboutchallenging Chuck Schumer,number one, she will haveno trouble raising money, Stone said during an appearance on Saturday Report. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

Maria James does recommend on Tuesday, July 13, 2021 Greetings from Maria James from Florida, United State. It is so overwhelming to know that honest hackers do still exist these days though it's hard to get to them. Have been living under a blind romantic scam with my boyfriend not knowing he was after my Dad money, no way to get to my dad except through me, he was hired to ruin my life. He made me fall in love with him so crazy and after two months of our relationship he traveled without my knowledge and I was so worried about him because I couldn't reach him and this lead me to Wizard Brixton and it was not easy getting to know this great wizard, I email him directly via WIZARDBRIXTON (AT) GMAIL (DOT) COM and he then asked me to reach him on WhatsApp if my case was very urgent and I urgently contacted him on WhatsApp with (+1- /807-23 ) 4-0428 ;) Immediately I contacted him' I asked him to help me with the exact location of my boyfriend where-about and he then asked for his mobile number and I gave it out to him not so long he just asked me to wait for 15 minutes and exactly the time he gave to me he got back with unbelievable news.I wouldn't have believed him if he didn't get back with proof because I so much trusted my boyfriend and loved him, why I log in to the mobile spy anonymous monitor I saw for myself that he was without another Lady in Maryland, USA. I then see all conversations and WhatsApp voice records with his boss. Well, All thanks to Wizard Brixton though it actually hurts to know the truth his services I highly recommend and he is very active and fast with a sense of humor. Do reach him today for similar cases and loss of funds. He also retrieves my funds back.|2025-03-16|https://www.hostreview.com/companies/wiredtree/reviews
NELSON — Voters approved 16 of 18 warrant articles Saturday morning at Nelson's annual town meeting. The $1.3 million budget and a proposal to provide $50,000 to support the town library were among those greenlit at the more than two-hour session, which drew 79 people to the Nelson Town Hall. Both articles passed by voice vote. The budget of $1,306,685 passed after limited discussion. This figure represents a 1.7 percent decrease from the $1,329,026 budget voters approved last year. Of the $51,099 approved for the town library, $45,099 will be raised by taxes and $6,000 will come from Library Memorial Funds, gifts, grants and other sources. Voters soundly rejected a pair of proposals related to the purchase and installation of backup power systems for the town. Article 15 asked voters to appropriate $218,000 for solar storage battery systems for the town hall/library, town office and the safety building. This equipment would have been used for backup power during electrical outages. The article was rejected on a secret ballot vote, 51-23. Article 16, a partner measure to Article 15, was defeated 58-16 in a secret ballot vote. It called for appropriating $99,000 for purchase and installation of a solar storage battery system for the town hall/library only. Article 16 was to be offered only if Article 15 failed. Articles 15 and 16 consumed the majority of discussion throughout the meeting. Debate on Article 15 alone absorbed more than 45 minutes. Several voters expressed skepticism about the safety and feasibility of such systems, particularly in light of the proposed costs. Advocates for the solar storage batteries pointed to the successes of recent solar projects in Nelson and the benefits of a $109,000 matching grant from Eversource that was part of the proposal. Selectboard Chair Brenna Kucinski said that, with the rejection of these measures, the board will propose buying generators for the buildings at next year's meeting. Several voters expressed support for generators over solar storage backup systems during the debate. Voters also approved a measure authorizing a $194,895 long-term lease/purchase agreement for a new wheel loader for the town's highway department. The measure passed, 66-7, on a ballot vote. Other items approved include $160,900 for the purchase of a new backhoe to replace the current 2003 model, along with several measures supporting adding money to various town capital reserve funds and trust funds.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/nelson-voters-back-budget-but-not-solar-storage-battery-systems/article_ef17d100-01e3-11f0-8d60-336aabf92b1b.html
A Crazy Rich Asians TV is in the works! Adele Lim, who co-wrote the 2018 film starring Constance Wu and Henry Golding, will serve as showrunner and executive producer of the highly anticipated TV series, which is in development at Max. Like the film, the show will be based on Kevin Kwan's book series of the same name. On February 28, 2025, Variety reported that Max would be expanding the Crazy Rich Asians universe into a TV series. Kevin's book series includes three novels: Crazy Rich Asians (2013), China Rich Girlfriend (2015), and Rich People Problems (2017). The author who executive produced the Crazy Rich Asiansfilm will also serve as the same for the Max show along with Warner Bros TV. The film's director, Jon M. Chu, will also return to executive produce. Considering that a TV show has more scope to explore the plot across a couple of episodes, it could be vastly different from the film. Jon seems to agree with these thoughts since he told The Hollywood Reporter on March 3, 2025, that the reason a series is happening before a sequel is because they needed more real estate. He further explained that the TV landscape allowed them to use all the characters. News on whether the OG cast members will return for the TV show is still up in the air. Jon M. Chu Hasn't Completely Ruled Out a Possibility of a Sequel to the Film Constance Wu and Gemma Chan in Crazy Rich Asians / Image via Warner Bros. Pictures While the TV show is definitely in the works, Jon hasn't completely ruled out the possibility of a sequel to the 2018 Crazy Rich Asians film. In the same interview, he confessed that they had tried developing the sequel ten times over, but it's still under development and is currently a version of something that he was unwilling to talk about. He explained that in the current scenario, the TV show just felt like the right way to go, but that doesn't mean the possibility of a sequel to the film is entirely ruled out. He further explained how talks and development of the movie eventually led to considering a TV show: I don't know if it's in lieu of a sequel, but it felt clear that every character we wanted to explore needed more room, and just a movie wasn't doing it for us. Jon also shed light on the fact that it was imperative that they got Adele on board to direct the TV series. On September 4, 2019, The Holywood Reporter had revealed that she had quit the sequel after alleged pay discrimination issues. Adele, who had co-written the film with Peter Chiarelli, was allegedly paid significantly less than the latter. Considering that talks of a sequel have been ongoing for a couple of years now, fans can rest easy as they await updates on the Max TV series. Max has yet to announce a release date for the Crazy Rich Asians TV series. In the meantime, you can stream the 2018 film on Max. Crazy rich asians poster Crazy Rich Asians Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Gemma Chan, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, Ken Jeong, Lisa Lu, Harry Shum Jr. Release Date August 15, 2018 (USA) Stream On Max, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV (availability may vary) Directed by Jon M. Chu Produced by Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, John Penotti Based On Crazy Rich Asians novel by Kevin Kwan Plot Summary Rachel Chu, a Chinese-American professor, travels to Singapore with her boyfriend Nick Young, only to discover he belongs to one of the wealthiest families in Asia. Drama, culture clashes, and romance unfold as she navigates the elite world.

f 6549 Marin Memorial Day Races The day started off with the 5k at 8 am. Then at 8:30 was the featured event...the 10k. The course runs through five different small towns finishing up on the new track at the College of Marin. It is a fast course for most. The quality of the field is always very strong. This was Bob Anderson's 23rd race of the year. He ran 42:16 which was only good for 7th place in his division. Several Ujena Fit Club members ran well including Bill Dunn, Dr. JoAnn, John Hirschberger, and Hans. I think Hans posted the best age-graded performance of anyone. At 72 he ran under 41 minutes. Photos taken at the start, just after four miles and on the track with 200 meters to go.

Gordon's understanding of what listeners need to know and the questions they'd like answered are a perfect match for the morning show. Before taking the helm at The Wall Street Journal This Morning in November 2005, Gordon was well-known to New York City radio listeners, having worked at both WINS-AM and WCBS-AM where he honed his writing skills and developed his distinctive on-air reporting style. He also served as a New York City bureau chief for Metro Networks where his reports aired on WOR-AM and WABC-AM. Gordon began his career in radio as a play-by-play sports announcer for Rutgers University, his alma mater. He also finds time to work as Public Address announcer for New York Giants football and Army football. His hobbies include fishing, whitewater rafting, and coaching soccer. He lives with his wife Kelly and their two children in central New Jersey.|2025-03-16|https://wflanews.iheart.com/featured/this-morning-with-gordon-deal/
gen z dashabord 730x414 at Is Generation Z Ruining The Car? They say that music peaked in the 80s and 90s and it's been downhill since then. A lot of people believe that is because, to quote a hiphop giant, fourteen-year olds now control the remote, meaning they are the biggest market, and whatever garbage they like becomes the norm. The same goes for our mobile phones, and clothes, and movies, and of course, cars. Whatever Generation Z likes, that's what we're getting. So if you don't like the current trends of the auto industry, blame it on Generation Z. Car makers want to sell cars, and it is natural for them to pander to the biggest customer base. So they tame their designs so as not to shock those sensitive kids, dull their sharpness to become snowflake-friendly, and what we really don't like, cram the cars full of unnecessary tech features. Don't get me wrong, a lot of the new technology features are vital and good, especially those that have to do with safety and convenience. But some of these new connectivity features, they are just getting ridiculous. Let me elaborate with some examples. I think the satellite navigation is a wonderful thing, and I love the fact that I can play my music on the car's speakers straight from my phone. They are amazing features. But do I really need the sat nav to have 3D maps and special effects, like it's some sort of a video game? And do I need to be able to run all of my apps on the car's screen? Why would I want to have my picture gallery on that display? Worse still, do I want to be fingering that bloody screen, pinch and zoom, while I'm driving? This is what I'm on about when I talk about unnecessary, wasteful, and sometimes distracting tech we can do without. And why do we have all these stupid features? Because those are what the youth of today wants – the generation that lives behind the screen of their phones, can't see anything unless it is through that blasted rectangular glass, can't feel anything unless it is presented to them in form of emojis. The Millennials look like hippies compared to these idiots. They want to be able to Tweet and Instagram while taking a dump, so of course they would want them in their cars as well. Of course, they want gesture control, and multi-touch screens, and a customizable instrument panel. These superficial bastards have no conception of substance. Of course they are amused by colors and graphics. Thanks to Generation Z, in a decade cars will be judged not by how much power they make or how well they drive, but the resolution of their in-dash screen, how many pixel per inch they have, how many apps they can run. I know what you're thinking. This is nothing but an angry rant by an irrelevant old fart who laments over the good old days. But I do like technology. I really do. It's just that I like living and feeling things more. I want technology to enhance my life, not control it. Time was I would go for a drive just to get a respite from all the technology that surrounds me every minute of every day. Now it follows me in the car. There is no getting away from it…|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2018/07/how-much-tech-stuff-do-you-really-need-in-your-car/
The Brands brothers woke up after another Penn State dual loss. We need take downs, we need to escape, we need to ride them out, we need to be like them. Same things they say after tournament. Trouble is, their wrestlers don't seem to get better. Drake, Angelo, and Gabe were very good when they came in, same with the one-and-done transfers. They spent a lot of money and put together a very solid team, but the competition wasn't there. Look what DT has done in a short time after taking over a stale program headed by a legend, and the brothers aren't legends, only in Iowa. Their wrestlers know they're getting better, watch out for Hamiti. No one does less with more. The Hawks will be third to fifth every year as other teams slowly pass them with better coaches. Hawkeye fans deserve better, they just don't realize it.|2025-03-16|https://intermatwrestle.com/profile/1307-maxwell-smart/

Trump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning The airstrikes come days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. This image provided by the U.S. Navy shows an aircraft launching from the USS Harry S. Truman before airstrikes in Sanaa, Yemen March 15, 2025 Credit: U.S. Navy via AP WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in Sanaa and in the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

Invincible Season 3 came to an end with the debut of a powerful new Viltrumite foe, Conquest, and the animated series is celebrating with a special behind the scenes look at how star Jeffrey Dean Morgan has brought him to life. Invincible really shook things up for the final episode of the third season as when Mark had thought the worst was over after facing off against his variants, another Viltrumite had come to Earth with the intent of checking in on Mark's progress. But he's more interested in killing Mark in the hopes of having a huge fight that he can enjoy. Videos by ComicBook.com Conquest is the most twisted foe that has been seen in Invincible's animated series thus far, and bringing him to life is Jeffrey Dean Morgan (who knows a thing or two about twisted villains from Image Comics adaptations). Morgan was clearly the right choice for this villain, and now fans have gotten to see a cool look at his process with a special behind-the-scenes look at the episode itself. As Invincible shared on X, the clip showcases Morgan bringing Conquest's coolest speech to screen. Check it out below. Who Is Conquest in Invincible Season 3? Making his debut in the penultimate episode of the third season, Conquest is Invincible's strongest foe to date. He's the one that's been teased as the lingering threat by Anissa as someone who's much worse than she was. Mark realized this pretty much immediately as Conquest states how he's not really there to conquer the Earth, but instead make sure that Mark is wiped out by any means necessary. He's more interested in the result fight against Mark than he is about why he's supposed to be there in the first place. In fact, he's seemingly even scary to the rest of the Viltrum Empire. As Conquest himself explains to Mark (in a dramatic change from the original comics), he's actually very lonely because of this. He seeks so much in battle because he's often isolated and alone when it comes to his job. His name isn't even real, it's meant to just be a sign of what he's supposed to do. So the only joy he finds in his life is killing powerful enemies, and thus Morgan is able to bring that extra bit of sinister characterization to life as the finale ends the fight between the two. RELATED: Here's Where to Start the Invincible Comics After Season 3 Finale March 14, 2025 / — INVINCIBLE (@InvincibleHQ) / pic.twitter.com/AY0BCnAtMx / Hot diggity dog, it's Jeffrey in the booth. / Prime Video What's Next for Conquest? Invincible Season 3 ended with Conquest being soundly defeated by Mark and Eve, and Mark had seemingly confirmed the Viltrumite's death after their fight. But as seen in the episode's final moments, this is clearly not the last we'll be seeing of such a prominent foe. Cecil had kept him alive despite the danger because he wants to mine the Viltrumite for more information on the Empire, so it just remains to be seen how this is going to work in the next season. InvincibleSeason 4 was confirmed to be in the works shortly before the third season even premiered, and has been in the early works already. It's yet to be revealed when this next wave of episodes will hit, but series creator Robert Kirkman has been expressing a desire to potentially get new seasons to release on a potentially yearly basis. So if everything works out behind the scenes, we could be seeing the animated series return with a new season early next year (or some time later in 2026). What did you think of Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Conquest in Invincible's Season 3 finale? Let us know all of your thoughts about it in the comments!|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/anime/news/season-3-invincible-conquest-jeffrey-dean-morgan/
Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do.

Staff Reporter Panaji In yet another instance of cyber fraud, a woman from Panaji lost over Rs 4.35 lakh after she fell in the trap of good income through a 'work from home' job. Police said the fraudsters contacted the victim through WhatsApp claiming to be from a digital consulting and engineering firm offering the opportunity of working from home. Posing as a representative of the company, police said the accused asked her to download a telegram app and join a group, after which she was asked to invest some amount through GPay and NEFT app. Upon transferring over Rs 4 lakh, the victim realised that she was taken for a ride, prompting her to approach the police. Based on a complaint, a first information report (FIR) under Sections 319 (2), 318(4) of the BNS Act, 2023 and Section 66-D of Information Technology (Amendment Act 2008) Act has been registered.

Protests are popping up in the region against initiatives and decisions by President Donald Trump or the adviser Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Havertown-Area Community Action Network organized a protest on Saturday at Sproul Road and Baltimore Pike in Springfield Township. It ran from 1 to 2 p.m. and the theme was No Kings, meaning Trump and Musk. About 75 to 100 people attended. Also on Saturday, there was a protest outside the Tesla dealership in Devon.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. WASHINGTON (AP) — Claiming the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang, President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the legal battle brewing over Trump's move. The judge was scheduled to consider expanding the prohibition on deportation just minutes after Trump's afternoon announcement. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The act was last used as part of the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War II and has only been used two other times in American history, during World War I and the War of 1812. Trump argued in his declaration that it is justified because he contends the Tren de Aragua gang, a common talking point on the campaign trail, has ties to the regime of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Featured Local Savings Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. Trump pledged to use the Alien Enemies Act during his presidential campaign, and immigration groups were braced for it. That led to Saturday's unusual lawsuit, filed before Trump's declaration even became public. The suit by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward on behalf of five Venezuelans whose cases suddenly moved towards deportation in recent hours. James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being about to be deported. Boasberg said his order was to preserve the status quo. Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court should halt that path in its tracks, the department argued. The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversial act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law to swiftly deport those his administration contends are members of the gang. The White House is preparing to move about 300 people it identifies as members of the gang to detention in El Salvador. Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/ap/politics/trump-invokes-18th-century-law-to-speed-deportations-judge-stalls-it-hours-later/article_0e37c8a1-7935-5b7a-8f38-c25e6687651f.html
Vice President JD Vance acknowledged mistakes made by Department Of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk during his recently orchestrated mass firings of federal employees, claiming that there were a lot of good people who work in the government during an interview with NBC News. Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I'm accepting of mistakes, Vance said. I also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I'm also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government — a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn't work. Musk, the world's richest man, is leading President Donald Trump's initiative to slash federal spending and combat what he calls federal bureaucracy, which has included the termination of thousands of government employees since the inauguration in January. The billionaire has characterized many federal workers affected by the firings as fraudsters who couldn't be trusted to do their jobs. I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job, Vance said when asked about Musk's comments during the NBC News interview. Now, how many people is that? I don't know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it's a few thousand or much larger than that. However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people's business, he added. That doesn't distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don't want the person who doesn't show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.|2025-03-16|https://wflanews.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-jd-vance-acknowledges-mistakes-made-by-elon-musk/
HINSDALE — The annual town meeting had a hint of déjà vu for roughly 250 residents who turned out Saturday to the Hinsdale Middle/High School gym. Residents once again considered purchasing a property at 59 Plain Road on which to build a new fire station. Voters approved the purchase for the second time, after a yes vote last year was ruled invalid by the state. They also passed the town's budget and approved as written all but one article on the remainder of the warrant. Fire station vote, take two At a special town meeting in September, voters approved the purchase of a property on Plain Road for a new fire station at a heated three-hour meeting at town hall. Saturday, they considered the same article again. The N.H. Department of Revenue Administration deemed the September vote invalid in December because town officials changed the wording of the warrant article after it had been submitted to Cheshire County Superior Court to get approval for the special meeting. The change came because the seller lowered the asking price for the property. According to the department, the article residents voted on had to exactly match the one the court approved. The revenue department sent the decision to annual town meeting, where residents returned Saturday to the debate with vigor. The $399,000 appropriation, with $230,000 to come from the fire station building trust and $169,000 from the unassigned fund balance, was recommended 3-0 by the selectboard, with two abstentions, and not recommended by the budget committee, which voted against it 4-3 with two abstentions. Budget committee member Mike Bomba said some on the committee had remaining concerns about the proposal, including the use of money from the unassigned fund balance. It's a lot of money, and we don't have a lot of money in the unassigned fund balance. So that is a concern. If something big happens, where are we going to find the money? Bomba said. Selectboard Chair Steve Diorio said he's been in favor of a new building and the location on Plain Road since day one. If you look at any firehouse station in our area, they're all updated with more space … Even Swanzey passed their fire station, and it's been years, Diorio said. Swanzey voters passed a plan for a new fire station last Tuesday after similar proposals failed on seven previous ballots since 2015. Hinsdale residents spoke in favor of a new station, but some had lingering concerns about the proposed location, which includes the parcel of land as well as an old church building that will be incorporated into the future station. Resident Peter Ohmart called the proposed location more hazardous than feasible, saying he's concerned about fire trucks entering and exiting through a dangerous intersection. He said he also wants a more centralized location along Route 119. On 119, you would have a lot less problems … speed limits are higher so you wouldn't have the problems of being in a residential neighborhood. Mark Curtiss, who is on the fire department and drives the trucks, said the most dangerous intersection in town is the one on Main Street that the department currently has to pass through when leaving the existing station from Depot Street. Longtime Hinsdale resident Paul Barnard said he's concerned about moving the station away from downtown, as well as the availability of grant money for the project. The fire department intends to seek grant funding, but can't apply for grants until the town has a location approved, fire department members said. With President Trump cutting everything, I think we might be dreaming if we think we're going to get anything from the federal government for a while, Barnard said. Budget committee member Dan Seymour pushed back. We just keep finding excuses not to do it … Trump will leave office sooner or later, and we'll be able to get that money again, he said. A fire station is a necessity. When you're in trouble, you need them. We gotta keep this moving, folks. If we keep kicking this down the road, it's just going to get more and more expensive. Resident Arnie Rose echoed that sentiment. After touring the current station at an open house last fall, Rose said he was left with no doubt about the necessity of a new one. I owed it to them to go down there last fall for the open house. I'm glad I did. They need a new place, he said. How many times can we keep kicking them down the road or pushing them aside? They need it. The end. The article passed 158-70 in a near-exact replica of the 155-78 September vote, to Fire Chief Terry Zavorotny's relief. He said after the meeting he was optimistic about the purchase passing, but had been dreading hearing the same questions and concerns he feels have already been answered. Zavorotny said the next step for the department is to start applying for grants to help pay for building the new station. Water and sun Voters approved a $228,000 appropriation to bring the town's water system into compliance with the Federal Lead and Copper Rule. According to Town Administrator Kathryn Lynch, the rule requires all public water systems to confirm they are meeting federal limits on lead and copper entering the water supply. There is a government loan program available this year with significant principal forgiveness to support towns' efforts to get into compliance. The town will use the funding to identify sources of lead and copper in the system and to engineer and purchase parts for replacements as needed. The principal forgiveness of about two-thirds isn't guaranteed if the town waits until next year to apply, Lynch said. The $228,000 will be borrowed through the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, according to the warrant. Any cost not covered by the principal repayment will be paid through water user fees. Lynch said the town won't have to make any payments on the loan until the project is finished, and could then be eligible for a multi-year repayment plan if necessary. The article needed a three-fifths majority to pass and got it with a secret ballot vote of 210-2. Residents also passed a $200,000 plan to build a 60-kilowatt solar photovoltaic energy system at the town's transfer station. The build will be funded by a N.H. Department of Energy Municipal Solar Assistance grant and have no immediate impact on taxes, according to the warrant. Hinsdale Community Development Coordinator Joshua Green said the system could save the town as much as $25,000 per year on electricity costs for about 25 years. Green said the town will likely enter a maintenance contract with Barrington Power — the company that will be installing the array — at a cost of about $1,000 per year to upkeep and monitor the system. The article passed by voice vote.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/hinsdale-residents-again-pass-land-purchase-for-new-fire-station/article_54398f4e-01c9-11f0-9346-a3c35f355a81.html
- Advertisement - On the Big Issues last Sunday, we examined the value of the current Caribbean education system. As we move forward it can be useful to look back to see where we are coming from. The following is taken from pages 155 & 156 of A History of Antigua by Brian Dyde and used with permission from Barbara Arrindell who holds the copyright. Now that slavery had ended the sick, the unfit and the aged were abandoned to find their own salvation with whatever help they could obtain from their relatives, or from the Daily Meal Society, a charity which received no official support until 1855. Education would have been treated in the same way, had schools of a sort not already been opened by the missionaries, and if the British Government had not specified otherwise. A sum of £30 000 a year for five years, followed by decreasing annual amounts thereafter until 1845, known as the Negro Education Grant, had been included in the British Emancipation Act. From the grant each colony was to be allocated in the first year an amount in proportion to the number of ex-slaves for whom compensation had been paid, with administration of the money 'secured through the agency of the different religious bodies already engaged in promoting Education.' In December 1835, under the first allocation, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel received £1000 for use in Antigua, and the island's Legislature was called upon to introduce an act to enforce compulsory education. 1 big issues An informed, literate black population was the last thing the plantocracy wanted to see and, with responsibility for education among the ex-slaves safely removed from any charge on the Treasury, another twenty-two years were to go by before any such act was introduced. Within two years of emancipation nearly 5200 children were receiving some sort of education. The Anglicans, Methodists and Moravians all had day, evening and Sunday schools, with the majority of the day schools teaching their pupils very little other than reading and writing. Arithmetic was taught only in the few 'National' schools, while Bible studies of course dominated those open on Sunday. All the schools were in the main staffed by women, coloured and black, of whom many were considered by one observer to be 'by no means equal to the task.' There were extremely few trained teachers, and even the opening of the non-denominational Mico Charity Normal School in St John's in 1838 did little to improve matters. This institution, which remained in existence until 1899, produced excellent male teachers, but at a rate of only ten to fifteen a year. As many of the trainees came from other colonies as far away as British Guiana the overall benefit to Antiguan education was very limited. In spite of these shortcomings the number of children attending school increased steadily until around 1847, by which time nearly 6500 were receiving some sort of education. After this the numbers fell dramatically as economic conditions forced children back into becoming wage-earners or made it impossible for their parents to clothe them decently. Those that were forced to abandon schooling at this time did so just as the Moravians opened their own establishment, intended 'to raise up well-qualified native Teachers and Assistants for Missionary Labour', at Cedar Hall a few miles south of St John's. Some years later, after moving to the city, this became the highly respected Spring Gardens Female Teachers' Training College, an institution which continued to produce teachers for all the Leeward Islands until its closure in 1958. A hundred years or so earlier, at about the same time as the first graduates were leaving the Cedar Hall establishment, there were less than 3000 children still attending school; most of them receiving an education judged to be no more than 'elementary and very meagre'. The Big Issues can be heard every Sunday from 1 pm – 3 pm on Observer Radio 91.1FM and is now sponsored by the Ryan Group of companies.

NEW MEXICO (KRQE) – A district court judge has ruled there is enough evidence to move forward with a murder case against an Otero County sheriff's deputy. In June of 2024, Deputy Jacob Diaz-Austin was responding to a welfare check after a 17-year-old was seen walking along the highway near Mescalero. Deputy Diaz-Austin stopped to speak with the teen, later identified as Elijah Hadley. Dashcam video shows Hadley toss a BB gun to the side as the deputy opens fire. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Bernalillo County District Attorney's office, which is prosecuting the case, says Hadley was shot 15 times and suffered multiple cuts.

Some religious Jewish and Christian groups believe the Messiah's arrival—whether for the first or second time—could be imminent. In their view, God has set the stage by returning Donald Trump to the White House. The president's recent actions—whether appointing Pastor Paula White, a staunchly pro-Israel Christian, to lead his new faith office in the West Wing, telling Israel to let hell break loose on Hamas and destroy the enemy, or likely preparing to announce that Israel can enact sovereignty over Judea and Samaria (also known as the West Bank)—have convinced some that their beliefs are correct. During a visit to the White House last week, former hostage Omer Shem Tov told Trump that he was sent by God to save them. (Credit: ILTV) Why Are Rabbis Backing MAGA? Their Answer Will Surprise You' Purim is where God orchestrates all these natural and political events in order to save Israel, explained Rabbi Tuly Weisz, founder and CEO of Israel365. And God places Esther in the palace 'for such a time as this.' Speaking on the ILTV News Podcast, Weisz said, A lot of people said that God placed Trump in the White House, but now they are starting to believe it. He pointed to Maimonides' teachings, which outlined three key events that would signal the coming of the Messiah. The first, he explained, is the destruction of Amalek, which many—including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after October 7—equate with modern-day Hamas. The second is a religious revival among the Jewish people. Some American Jews believe they see this happening in a growing surge of interest in religious involvement, while in Israel, it is reflected in the rise of the religious right. According to Weisz, the final stage is the rebuilding of the Temple on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem. Building the Temple would be total victory in this war, he said, noting that Hamas called the October 7 attack the 'Al-Aqsa Flood,' a direct reference to the Temple Mount. God willing, we will celebrate a joyous Purim with the release of all our hostages, Weisz continued. And we will have that Third Temple we have prayed for 1,000 years. It will be thanks to Donald Trump and to all the Jews who are finally saying, 'Enough of this nonsense—we are going to take action.' Watch these previous podcasts: Through his organization Israel365—and a new initiative called Israel365 Action—Weisz has been at the forefront of efforts to promote Israeli sovereignty among Jewish and Christian supporters. (קרדיט: ILTV) WEST BANK ANNEXATION? Last year, in partnership with several other organizations, Israel365 pushed for a resolution at the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention, urging Christian media to stop referring to Judea and Samaria as the West Bank and instead use its biblical name. This year, NRB took it a step further. With backing from Israel365 and similar groups, it signed a resolution supporting Israeli sovereignty in these areas. The movement has also gained traction beyond NRB. At the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), similar pro-sovereignty statements were embraced. And just last week in Jerusalem, a group calling itself the Christian Conference of Presidents promoted the same agenda. However, Israel365 and its advocacy arm, Israel365 Action, have not been without controversy. Last week, the group honored MAGA (Make America Great Again) leader Steve Bannon at an event in Texas. Bannon has been accused of antisemitism, and most recently, he was criticized for making a gesture that resembled a Nazi salute. Despite this, Israel365 Executive Director Pesach Wolicki, who joined Weisz on the ILTV News Podcast, defended Bannon, calling him unapologetically pro-Israel. He argued that Bannon plays a key role in convincing members of the MAGA movement—some of whom are skeptical of Israel—that the Jewish state is a crucial ally. Bannon said that attacks against Israel are an attack on Judeo-Christian Western civilization, Wolicki told ILTV. He noted that Bannon broadcasts four hours daily and listens to much of his content. I've never heard him say anything antisemitic, Wolicki claimed. He actually gets attacked by the anti-Israel wing of the MAGA movement for being too pro-Israel. According to Wolicki, Bannon is working to reframe the way MAGA supporters view Israel. Rather than seeing it purely as a geopolitical issue tied to military aid, Bannon wants them to recognize it as part of a more significant ideological and global conflict. Weisz echoed this perspective. He attended the Texas event and said Bannon received a standing ovation for his pro-Israel remarks. Wolicki has fully embedded himself in the MAGA movement. In December, he attended AmericaFest, the largest MAGA event of the year. He said he was likely the only person there wearing a yarmulke. He also remains in regular conversation with Bannon. His reason? Wolicki believes the movement could quickly turn against Israel, influenced by rising voices like Candace Owens and Tucker Carlson, both of whom have made antisemitic and anti-Israel statements and have Trump's ear. If the movement were a fully pro-Israel movement and didn't have any problematic voices in it, then there wouldn't be such a sense of urgency to get involved with them, Wolicki said on the podcast. Israel365 Action is running a slate in the upcoming World Zionist Congress elections. Weisz said one of the platform's main goals is to push for sovereignty among Jewish community members. The election is only open to Jewish voters. Established by Theodor Herzl in 1897, the World Zionist Congress and its representatives from Jewish communities worldwide allocate $1 billion annually to Jewish causes. They also oversee Israel's key national institutions, including the World Zionist Organization, which carries out the Congress's vision; the Jewish Agency, which plays a central role in Jewish immigration to Israel; and the Jewish National Fund, which owns 13% of Israel's land. We unapologetically stand for Judea and Samaria. We want stronger relationships between Jews and Christians, and we want new leadership, Weisz said. He believes there must be new leadership in the Jewish world because, in his view, a Palestinian state would pose an existential threat to Israel. He argued that too many Jewish leaders, especially on the liberal left, fail to understand this. Israel365 Action has faced criticism, with some accusing it of being a covert Christian organization or of recruiting Christians to vote in the election. In December, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman distanced himself from the slate amid allegations that Israel365 Action had a hidden Christian agenda. At the time, the group was known as the One Jewish State slate—named after Friedman's book advocating sovereignty over Judea and Samaria. The organization denied the accusations and later changed its name to Israel365 Action. But Weisz pushed back against the claims. There is nothing secret about our work in the Christian community. We're very proud to have taken that leadership position, he said. He emphasized that the slate's website clearly states— many times in bold letters —that only Jews can vote and that the movement is for Jews. Separate efforts, he added, exist for Christians. Wolicki echoed this point. We're not trying to slip some Christians in the back door, he said.|2025-03-16|https://www.ynetnews.com/article/s1esnx5okx
Vice President JD Vance acknowledged mistakes made by Department Of Government Efficiency leader Elon Musk during his recently orchestrated mass firings of federal employees, claiming that there were a lot of good people who work in the government during an interview with NBC News. Elon himself has said that sometimes you do something, you make a mistake, and then you undo the mistake. I'm accepting of mistakes, Vance said. I also think you have to quickly correct those mistakes. But I'm also very aware of the fact that there are a lot of good people who work in the government — a lot of people who are doing a very good job. And we want to try to preserve as much of what works in government as possible, while eliminating what doesn't work. Musk, the world's richest man, is leading President Donald Trump's initiative to slash federal spending and combat what he calls federal bureaucracy, which has included the termination of thousands of government employees since the inauguration in January. The billionaire has characterized many federal workers affected by the firings as fraudsters who couldn't be trusted to do their jobs. I think some people clearly are collecting a check and not doing a job, Vance said when asked about Musk's comments during the NBC News interview. Now, how many people is that? I don't know, in a 3 million-strong federal workforce, whether it's a few thousand or much larger than that. However big the problem is, it is a problem when people are living off the generosity of the American taxpayer in a civil service job and not doing the people's business, he added. That doesn't distract or detract from the fact that you do have a lot of great civil servants who are doing important work. But I think most of those great civil servants would say we want to be empowered to do our job. We don't want the person who doesn't show up five days a week to make it harder for us to do what we need to do.|2025-03-16|https://wrko.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-jd-vance-acknowledges-mistakes-made-by-elon-musk/
Cleveland running back Nick Chubb broke his foot during the host Browns' 21-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. Chubb was injured during the third quarter and did not return to the game. He finished with nine carries for 41 yards and one fumble, and no receptions on one target. A four-time Pro Bowl honoree, Chubb got a late start this season after sustaining multiple torn ligaments and undergoing two surgeries on his left knee following a season-ending injury against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 18, 2023. Chubb, who turns 29 on Dec. 27, has started all eight games he has played this season and has 102 carries for 332 yards and three touchdowns, and five receptions for 31 yards and one score. I have a first-row seat to what he's been able to do, Stefanski said after Sunday's game. I can't tell you how much I respect him as a person, what he means to this football team. So really, really disappointed about this injury. Does not change the fact that he continues to inspire this football team with how he approaches every single day. I know this is just another obstacle that he will overcome. Cleveland selected Chubb in the second round of the 2018 NFL Draft out of Georgia. He has 6,843 yards and 51 TDs on the ground, and 1,042 receiving yards and five TDs in 85 regular-season games (78 starts). He was selected for the Pro Bowl for four consecutive seasons from 2019-22, topping 1,000 rushing yards in each campaign.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/browns-coach-rb-nick-chubb-breaks-foot-vs-chiefs/
Nick Gleeson noticed a dearth of live comedy when he first moved west of the Blue Mountains. Photo: Supplied/AAP PHOTOS When people hear about Nick Gleeson's comedy business, they naturally think of his brother Tom. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading Yes, Tom Gleeson is one of Australia's most successful stand-ups, hosts the ABC's high-rating Hard Quiz and notoriously lampooned the Logie Awards while gripping the gold. But the acerbic comedian wasn't the inspiration for Central West Comedy, Nick Gleeson's booming venture that brings big name comics to the bush. Soon after he and wife Ruby moved from Sydney to Orange, they noticed a desperate dearth of live comedy west of the NSW Blue Mountains. I just said, 'Why don't we change this?' Gleeson told AAP. I've been going to comedy for a very long time. It's just a coincidence that Tom Gleeson is my brother. Star on the national stage Tom Gleeson has helped promoter brother Nick take laughter to the bush. (Darren England/AAP PHOTOS) Star on the national stage Tom Gleeson has helped promoter brother Nick take laughter to the bush. (Darren England/AAP PHOTOS) So the couple launched a monthly comedy night at their bustling cafe in central Orange in 2017, with Tom taking the stage at Factory Espresso at the end of a national tour. I've been doing all the capitals and I'm finishing at a cafe in Orange. At my brother's cafe, the comedian drily quipped to the local paper. Gleeson had been concerned about suggestions of nepotism when he branched out into comedy but his straight-talking brother told him: Who cares? It turned out the brotherly connection only went so far anyway. The couple worked for years to build up trust with leading comedians and agents, eventually attracting a steady stream of headliners to their eatery through reliable hospitality. By early 2020, Aaron Chen, Tony Martin, Akmal, Matt Okine and Sam Simmons had all performed on their little stage next to the kitchen. While touring art exhibitions, theatre, Shakespeare and live music have long been mainstays in regional Australia's cultural life, comedy is burgeoning. Melbourne and Sydney's comedy festival showcases will both tour the regions from May, while Gleeson's work is opening the door for other local events like the Lithgow Comedy Festival in late March. The demand is strong enough that Gleeson sold Factory Espresso in 2024 to focus on bringing comedy to the country. Since then, he has managed to lure the likes of Dave Hughes, Michael Hing, Tom Ballard, Lizzy Hoo, Dilruk Jayasinha and Dave Thornton to regional venues. The performers often use the smaller shows to test new material, while audiences are appreciative of a big act coming to town. The country audiences are tougher, (because) it's a rare thing, Gleeson says. They won't just give their laughs away. Veteran comedian Gary Eck, who is headlining the Lithgow Comedy Festival, said regional shows were an affordable way for stand-ups to develop their sets and country crowds were always enthusiastic. Comics also tended to leap at any chance to perform on any scale, Eck says. Comedy is the one profession where people will happily do it for nothing just to get runs on the board, he says. No other profession is going to give you that. Labourers don't knock on your door and say, 'Hey do you mind if I get some experience and re-do your back shed?' Whereas comedians, it's a passion-driven thing, you're compelled to do it, so you've got to go where it's happening. Promoters have lured a host of high profile acts to regional Australia including Dave Hughes. (HANDOUT/AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX) Promoters have lured a host of high profile acts to regional Australia including Dave Hughes. (HANDOUT/AUSTRALIAN GRAND PRIX) As more people escape the cities for country Australia, led by millennials, new cultural scenes are emerging. Lithgow Comedy Festival organiser and local councillor Tom Evangelidis moved from Sydney to the mining town at the foot of the Blue Mountains in recent years. He is working hard to change the tired stereotypes that hang over the community of 20,000. The comedy festival, which is in its third year, is one way to do that. Lithgow has had a pretty bad rap for a long time - it's always been viewed as working class and just a place to drive through, Evangelidis says. It's done its fair share of heavy lifting for the country and state. Now it's someone else's turn, it's time for Lithgow to smell the roses. * Rhys Nicholson and Kirsty Webeck will perform at Orange's LGBTQIA+ Rainbow Festival on March 21. * The Lithgow Comedy Festival runs over the weekend of March 29-30. * Pete Helliar and Ellen Briggs have shows in Armidale, Tamworth, Inverell, Dubbo, Bathurst, Orange and Molong in May.|2025-03-16|https://www.redlandcitybulletin.com.au/story/8917707/how-a-country-cafe-cracked-up-the-rural-comedy-scene/?cs=30776
The Brief The NTSB is expected to begin its on-scene investigation into a deadly crash that killed 5 people on I-35. Investigator Kenny Bragg said preliminary information shows the driver of a semi-truck did not slow down when approaching a work zone Thursday night. The agency will work to determine the speed of the truck prior to the crash and examine the work site to make sure it was following federal standards. AUSTIN - The National Transportation Safety Board will begin its on-scene investigation Sunday of a 17-vehicle crash that killed five people in Austin on Thursday night. NTSB Update on I-35 Crash What's next NTSB investigator Kenny Bragg said during a news conference Saturday that they expect to be in Austin investigating the crash between seven and 10 days. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Bragg said the agency would look at the design and safety of the area where the crash happened, collision avoidance technology, motor carrier operations including driver monitoring, compliances practices and the drivers' conditions. The agency said a preliminary report on the crash should be available in about a month. Another update from the agency is planned for Sunday. What happened? The backstory Austin police say 17 people and 17 vehicles, including a semi-truck, were involved in the crash on I-35 southbound in North Austin near Parmer Lane and Howard Lane. APD says the initial call was received at around 11:30 p.m. on March 13. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The accident stretched more than a tenth of a mile, which is about 500 feet. Five people, including a child and an infant, were pronounced dead at the scene; 11 others were transported to local hospitals. Two adults with life-threatening injuries were taken to St. David's Round Rock. NTSB investigator Kenny Bragg said the semi-truck was approaching a work zone on I-35 that had reduced the lanes from three to one and did not slow down before hitting other vehicles in traffic. There's several sources of information we can use to determine the truck speed, Bragg said. We'll look at the engine control module. We'll look at possible surveillance video and even, telematic data from the truck. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The work zone will also be examined to determine if it followed federal standards for work zone signage, speed and lane closures. Suspect arrested in I-35 crash What we know Solomun Weldekeal Araya, 37, was arrested and charged with five counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault. He is being held in the Travis County Jail. Records show he was due in court next week in Wilmer, in the Dallas area, for going 63 mph where the speed limit was 30 mph. What we don't know Many questions surround Araya and his role in the crash. An Amazon Prime truck was seen in the wreckage by FOX 7 cameras. At this time, it is unclear whether Araya was the one driving the Amazon truck. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement When FOX 7 Austin asked APD if Araya was driving the truck, they responded: We are still very early in the investigation. There are no further details available for release at this time.

Roger Stone told Newsmax on Saturday that the leftward lurch of many of the younger liberal representatives illustrates the fundamental change in the Democrat Party, adding that the party of John F. Kennedy and Harry Truman no longer exisists. Earlier in the day, it was reported that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is threatening to primary fellow New York Democrat, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, over his last-minute support of the Republican-backed continuing resolution. Stone said old-school corporate Democrats like Chuck Schumer are now vulnerable. Let me remind you that AOC defeated JoeCrowley — who was not only amember of Congress, but thehead of the Queens DemocratParty machine — to win herstate to begin with.

CAIRO — Hamas said Saturday it will only release an American-Israeli and the bodies of four other hostages if Israel implements their ceasefire agreement, calling it an exceptional deal aimed at getting the truce back on track. Meanwhile, Israeli airstrikes killed nine people in Gaza including local journalists, medics and a watchdog said. A senior Hamas official said long-delayed talks over the ceasefire's second phase would need to begin the day of the release and last no longer than 50 days. Israel also would need to stop barring the entry of humanitarian aid and withdraw from a strategic corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. Israel has said it won't withdraw there, citing the need to combat weapons smuggling. Hamas would also demand the release of more Palestinian prisoners in exchange for hostages, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Edan Alexander, 21, who grew up in New Jersey, was abducted from his military base during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war. He is the last living U.S. citizen held in Gaza. Hamas still has 59 hostages, 35 believed to be dead. Speaking at a protest camp set up last week outside Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv, relatives of hostages said Netanyahu was violating the agreement he signed and abandoning the hostages in Gaza. You want to sacrifice our children for the pleasures of power, said Itzik Horn, father of hostage Eitan and freed hostage Iair. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late Saturday told negotiators to prepare for the continuation of talks regarding the release of hostages, his office said. Airstrikes kill 9 Two Israeli airstrikes in the northern town of Beit Lahiya near the border killed at least nine people, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The Palestinian Journalists' Protection Center, a local watchdog, said the dead included three Palestinian journalists who were documenting aid distribution. Local health official Fares Awad identified one as Mahmoud Islim, who was operating a drone. The Israeli military said it struck two people operating a drone that it said posed a threat to soldiers in the area. It said it launched another strike at a group of people who came to collect the drone equipment. The army identified all of those targeted as suspected militants, without providing evidence. Hamas in a statement called the attack a serious escalation showing Israel's attempts to sabotage any opportunity to implement the ceasefire agreement. Also Saturday, Israel's military said it removed a platoon of soldiers from Gaza who were seen in a video on social media opening fire during a celebration of the Jewish holiday of Purim. The video shows soldiers shooting, apparently randomly, while another performs the customary reading of the Book of Esther. The military said the soldiers will face disciplinary measures. No major fighting has occurred in Gaza since the ceasefire took hold on Jan. 19, but Israeli strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians who the military said had entered unauthorized areas, engaged in militant activities or otherwise violated the truce. Israel has cast doubt on Hamas' offer The United States said it presented on Wednesday a proposal to extend the ceasefire a few weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. It said Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making entirely impractical demands. Talks continued in Egypt, which along with Qatar has served as mediators with Hamas in the indirect talks with Israel. Israel and Hamas were to begin negotiations on the ceasefire's second phase in early February, but only preparatory talks have been held. In Phase Two, Hamas would release all remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting truce. The first phase saw the release of 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight others in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Israeli forces pulled back to a buffer zone along Gaza's border and allowed a surge of humanitarian aid. After the first phase ended early this month, Israel said it had agreed to a new U.S. proposal in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages in return for a vague commitment to negotiate a lasting ceasefire. Hamas rejected that offer. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that he held in-depth discussions with the negotiating team and security officials on Saturday evening. Afterward, he told the negotiating team to prepare for continued talks as per the mediator's response to the U.S. proposal, the statement said. Palestinian official says no fuel left for wells For two weeks, Israel has barred the delivery of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians, and cut electricity to the territory a week ago, to pressure Hamas to accept the new proposal. The southern city of Rafah, on the Gaza-Egypt border, said it could no longer provide fuel needed to pump water from dozens of wells. Ahmed al-Sufi, head of the municipality, said fuel shortages caused by the Israeli siege have forced it to suspend essential services, threatening the lives of thousands. The war has destroyed vast areas of Gaza, displaced most of the population and left nearly everyone dependent on international aid. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 hostage. Most have been released in deals, while Israel rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more. Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants.

Wins First-Ever US Listing Spirited Union, the world's first botanical rum company, has achieved an important environmental goal – full 'Chain of Custody' certification by Bonsucro, the global sugarcane sustainability organisation. The Amsterdam-based company has always championed ethical practices by purchasing, as a member since 2022, Bonsucro-certified molasses. This new certification is a significant acknowledgement of its positive contribution to the sugarcane industry. It officially recognises Spirited Union's commitment to measures which help improve labour conditions both on sugarcane farms and in mills, as well as those that reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable farming. While sugarcane is incredibly versatile, it's also one of the world's thirstiest crops (it takes over 806 liters of water to produce just 0.45kg of refined cane sugar). However, Bonsucro-certified mills, on average, reduce water usage by 43% within five years. The organization's standards have a similarly positive effect across other aspects of sugarcane production. Spirited Union's Bonsucro certification coincides with its first-ever US grocery listing – with ethical retailer, Whole Foods Market. The deal, coordinated by Pacific Edge Wine and Spirits, initially sees Spirited Union's Queen Pineapple botanical rum stocked in stores across California, Nevada, Colorado and Washington State. Retailing at $26.99 (70cl), this is a Panamanian rum uniquely fermented with pineapple yeast and blended with cinnamon and Tanzanian cloves. Spirited Union founder Ruben Maduro said: This Bonsucro certification and stocking in Whole Foods Market are two massive ticks of approval for our long-held values and ethics. We're committed to growth, but not at the expense of the environment – we'll stick firmly to this planet and people-friendly path. U.S. stocking inquiries: Pacific Edge Wine and Spirits.

MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. (WCIV) — The St. Patrick's Day 5K in Mount Pleasant set the stage for the weekend's festivities, with participants running for more than just fun. It was an early Saturday morning, but the energy was high as participants geared up for the Chase the Leprechaun 5K. With music pumping and participants stretching, everyone was ready to hit the pavement - but one runner summed it up perfectly: This is one of the first good weeks of the year, and everyone loves running. Running is a great way to wake up, and I think everyone is excited for that post-run beer as well. I know I am. However, the fun costumes and shamrocks were just the surface of this race. The event had a greater purpose: It was raising funds for the Racers for Pacers program, a nonprofit initiative that allows individuals with special needs to compete in 5Ks and 10Ks. Racers for Pacers is a nonprofit that helps take out special needs kids to participate in races, with volunteers acting as their pacers, explained one volunteer. It's a wonderful charity, and we do this for a great cause. The program's mission is simple: bring together volunteers and participants to create lasting bonds. Racers are individuals with disabilities, and the pacers are the volunteers who push them throughout the race. It's a partnership built on support, care, and community spirit. READ MORE Volunteers are at the heart of the program, and many of them form deep connections with the racers. I'm always inspired by kiddos like Maddie, who have the odds stacked against them. Despite the challenges, they always have the most positive attitude, one volunteer shared. Seeing them overcome so much, I thought if I could share my passion for running with others, it would be a great way to spend my Saturday. The program isn't just a race, it's a life-changing experience for both racers and pacers. Families like those involved in the program form lifelong relationships, sharing meaningful moments and making memories together. The event was a massive success, raising nearly $8,000 for the Racers for Pacers athletes and providing a sense of community for all involved. One participant put it best: It's like a family here. Everyone is working together to make something special happen. The Racers for Pacers program operates year-round, and it's always looking for more volunteers and participants. Whether you're interested in being a racer or a pacer, the program welcomes anyone looking to make a difference.

Shortstop Gunnar Henderson said he believes he can return from injury in time to take the field with the Baltimore Orioles on Opening Day. Their season opens March 27 on the road against the Toronto Blue Jays. Henderson, 23, would be one month removed from the strained intercostal muscle that knocked him out of Grapefruit League games Feb. 27. He began returning to limited baseball activities this week and said Saturday morning he's on the right track and thinks Opening Day is a feasible target. That's my plan, Henderson said. That's what I'm hoping for. Henderson upramped from dry swings to taking cuts in the cage and fielding ground balls on Wednesday for the first time since the injury. Barring setbacks, he still could see innings in the field before the curtain falls on spring training March 23. Henderson played 159 games and was a first-time All-Star in 2024 with 37 home runs, 31 doubles, 92 RBIs and an OPS of .893. He was the American League Rookie of the Year in 2023. The Orioles plan to be cautious in their approach based on Henderson's history with abdominal muscle strains. He fought through left oblique discomfort the first three weeks of spring training last year. The latest injury is different, Henderson said, and has lingered more than previous issues. He had only six at-bats (one hit) in three spring training games before he strained the muscle jumping for a line drive.|2025-03-16|https://www.wjoxam.com/news/orioles-ss-gunnar-henderson-shooting-for-opening-day-return/
Trump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later Trump invoked the 1798 Act Saturday, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2, to speed up mass deportations. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, March 3, 2025. Credit: Pool via AP WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/nation-world/judge-limits-trumps-deport-people-under-alien-enemies-act/507-11894e2b-e26c-4121-965a-0d38c250227e
- Advertisement - Dear Koren, I'm getting married in December to the love of my life, but we're facing a really strange situation that's causing some tension with us. My fiancée wants her mother to walk her down the aisle instead of her father. Her parents are separated because her father cheated on her mother way back when and she still carries a lot of hurt from what happened. She says having her mother walk her is a way of honoring the woman who stood by her through everything. To be open with you, the mother and the father still talk; they are not enemies. The problem is that I come from a very traditional background, and it feels wrong to me to not have her father do what should be his role. Her mother is also uncomfortable, saying she doesn't want to take the father's place. I've tried to explain my feelings, but she is being stubborn, saying this is about her feelings and her special day. I don't want to start our marriage on the wrong foot, but this doesn't feel right. A woman cannot take a man's place. Should I let it go, or should I insist that she follows tradition and give her father that honor? Conflicted Groom Dear Conflicted Groom, Wow! I'm always interested to see how people handle differences and conflict before marriage because it often sets the stage for what will obtain after the wedding. I can see that tradition is important to you, but it is also apparent that you care about your partner's happiness. It's natural to feel uncomfortable when something challenges what we've always believed to be right — I personally struggle with change, so I understand your reluctance. However, marriage is not only the merging of two lives but also of two worlds — each with its own history, wounds, and ways of seeing life. What may feel like a break in tradition to you might feel like a moment of healing and empowerment for your fiancée. Walking down the aisle is a deeply symbolic act — not just about who gives her away, but about who has walked with her through the hardest moments of her life. If her mother was her rock during painful times, then perhaps this is her way of honoring that unwavering love. At the same time, I hear your desire to ensure that the father-daughter bond is not disrespected. Since her parents are still on speaking terms, perhaps there is a way to honour both parents — allowing her mother to walk her halfway down the aisle and then her father to complete the journey or them doing it together. This could symbolize the support she's received from both of them, even if in different ways. It would be a marriage of preference and tradition and also the beginning of you both learning to understand each other, compromise and work through challenges. Of course, she would have to agree to this willingly and not by force. Ultimately, the greatest gift you can give your future wife is the space to make this decision for herself — not out of pressure or tradition, but out of what brings her peace. Trust that her healing will pave the way for the best version of the woman you're choosing to marry. That comment you made about a woman cannot take a man's place, I need you to check yourself on that. Maybe a woman cannot take a man's place but just observe your thought patterns to see how deep that goes and how that will influence your thinking as a husband and father. Marriage does not have to be built on history and old traditions – you can create your own reality as much as it is feasible. This may be your first opportunity to show her that, in your union, her voice matters and her feelings are safe with you. Her happiness is more important than tradition. Wishing you both a beautiful wedding and an even more beautiful partnership.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/my-fiancee-is-defying-tradition-and-this-makes-me-uncomfortable/

Canada and Greece have signed a memorandum of understanding to promote tourism between the two countries, a type of agreement one tourism expert says will become more common as Canada strengthens its bonds with European Union nations and looks for tourism markets beyond the United States. Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada says the agreement signed earlier this week will boost institutional co-operation and recreational travel between the two nations. Key areas of focus include institutional co-operation, the exchange of information and data related to travel and tourism, and the sharing of best practices on climate action in tourism, the federal department said in a press release Thursday. The department says the trade relationship between the countries has grown in recent years because of the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement. In 2024, bilateral merchandise trade with Greece was $645.8 million, it added. Mary Ng, Canadian minister of export promotion, international trade and economic development, said the agreement will make it easier for Canadians and Greeks to explore and enjoy each other's countries while supporting economic prosperity for both. For her part, Canada's Tourism Minister Pascale St-Onge says the agreement will bolster cultural ties between the countries. Wayne Smith, director at Toronto Metropolitan University's Institute for Hospitality and Tourism Research, says he expects Canada to sign more memorandums with other EU countries going forward as Canada and Europe grow closer. I think you're going to see a lot more Canadians going to Europe in general and anything that makes it easier or promotes Europe is probably a very good thing at this time because we're already seeing a shift from U.S. travel, he said in an interview Saturday. Many Europeans are also looking to travel to Canada instead of the U.S., he added. Both Europe and Canada have realized an overdependence on the U.S. marketplace is probably not healthy for the economies, Smith said.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/03/15/canada-and-greece-sign-memorandum-of-understanding-on-tourism-between-the-countries/
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online show plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. The extent of the damage was not yet clear. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthi rebels have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 until January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks greatly raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. The Saturday operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

Milestone reinforces readership in AI-powered breast cancer detection WELLINGTON, New Zealand, Oct. 25, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Volpara Health, a Lunit company and global leader in artificial intelligence (AI)-powered breast health solutions, has reached a significant milestone: the publication of the 300th peer-reviewed scientific paper using Volpara results. This accomplishment underscores Volpara's commitment to advancing breast cancer detection and personalized care through evidence-based AI technologies. The need for robust, peer-reviewed validation in mammography AI is essential to its clinical adoption. A review of 100 CE-marked AI products in radiology revealed that 64% lacked peer-reviewed evidence of efficacy. Volpara, in contrast, leads the mammography AI industry with the most peer-reviewed scientific papers, demonstrating its innovative technologies are rigorously tested, and clinically validated. Reaching 300 studies reflects the deep trust our technology has earned within both the academic and clinical communities, said Teri Thomas, CEO of Volpara Health and CBO of Lunit. Our commitment to peer validation provides important evidence of our AI solutions' ability to deliver measurable improvements in detection and patient outcomes. Two recent studies showcase the benefits of Volpara's AI technology. Breast density-based mammogram ordering enhances interpretation Enhancing Radiologist Reading Performance by Ordering Screening Mammograms Based on Characteristics That Promote Visual Adaptation, shows how ordering mammograms based on breast density can improve radiologists' performance. By arranging mammograms from low to high volumetric breast density (VBD), radiologists reduced reading time and increased specificity from 86% to 89%, leading to greater accuracy in detecting cancer. Commenting in an editorial on the study, Dr. Lars Grimm explained, Deliberate ordering of screening mammograms could be introduced into workflows very easily because it dovetails with existing batch-reading strategies. Study confirms Volpara's AI identifies Women at higher risk for missed cancers Breast Density Effect on the Sensitivity of Digital Screening Mammography in a UK Cohort, used Volpara's AI-powered algorithms to determine how breast density affects cancer detection in the UK. The study confirmed that Volpara's technology effectively identifies women at higher risk for missed cancers on mammography, reinforcing the importance of personalized screening strategies.

It's almost like clockwork these days in Maine. A powerful storm shows up at our doorstep, and just as quickly, the lights go off. After all, Maine suffers from the highest rate of power outages in the entire nation. Those statistics make it rather easy to blame the companies that maintain the power grid in the state. But as storm severity increases, the infrastructure that Maine is built upon is starting to look very tenuous. Why did a state with so much coastline built the majority of its power lines above ground? The answer is complex. The Cost to Move Power Lines Underground in Maine Would Be Substantial The top reason why the majority of power lines in Maine aren't placed underground is straightforward: it's all about the money. As astute homeowners in Maine have likely noticed, the majority of new developments in the state have utilities buried underground upon construction. Facebook via Central Maine Power The price tag is legitimate. Installation of underground lines can cost anywhere from five to 15 times more than standard overhead utility lines on poles. Depending on the size and scope of the project, that could mean millions of dollars. Speaking on money, Massachusetts once considered moving all power lines underground, and found the estimated cost to be more than one trillion dollars to complete the project. There Are Potential Ecological Problems For Underground Power Lines in Maine Another major problem with burying all power lines is what issues you may find underground. Everyone knows that water and electricity don't play nicely with one another, so placing lines underground in areas with high water tables or those susceptible to flooding can be extremely challenging. Campsite on a pond in Maine Maine is also a mountainous state. Just like with roads, blasting through rock to create pathways for power lines is time consuming and expensive. Future Disasters in Maine Could Be Even Costlier While power outages and a fragile grid continue to plague the majority of the state, it may end up falling on individual towns and cities to lead the way on changes. In some other states, cities where power outages had become commonplace have begun an effort to move utilities from poles to beneath the ground at their own expense. Power lines weighed down by ice cause damage along a country road. The thought process is simple: spend the money now before disaster strikes and forces the city to spend even more on repairs down the line. From wind storms to ice storms and beyond, some cities and municipalities in Maine will start to consider the upfront cost versus the down-the-line cost of this very thing. 20 Things You'll Find in a Typical New England Home Gallery Credit: Megan LOOK: These Are the Best Places to Live in America Stacker compiled a list of the best places to live using Niche data, which ranks places based on factors such as the cost of living.

When you think of Megan Fox, some of her roles that come to mind probably include Transformers or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,among other hits. However, Fox has been known to dabble in all things horror as well. Going all the way back to 2009, you likely remember her explosive performance in Jennifer's Body alongside Amada Seyfried. Due to the film's popularity, Diablo Cody has even mentioned that she would be interested in a Jennifer's Body sequel. While she sent chills up our spines as a possessed girl going after her high school's male population, Fox didn't decide to limit herself to the horror genre over the years, playing in various thrillers and TV sitcoms over the years. Videos by ComicBook.com If you are both a Netflix subscriber and a Megan Fox fan, perhaps you've been wondering how you can return to the feeling of pure terror you felt the first time you watched Jennifer's Body. From a spine-tingling android gone wrong to a dead husband's twisted plan, you will find that there are several binge-worthy Fox horrors waiting to be consumed. Here are three movies you can stream on Netflix right now that feature Fox in a mind-blowing horror role. Subservience Alice in Subservience / Image Courtesy of Prime Video AI is now at the forefront of many conversations in our current society and has inserted itself into art, technology, and more. In Subservience, Megan Fox appears as an AI SIM named Alice who starts out in a family caretaker role but slowly begins to gain awareness. If you enjoy horror movies with a rich background story and a slow burn with an immense payoff, this one may just be for you. Subservience follows a father named Nick (Michele Morrone) who is at risk of losing everything as SIMs begin to take over the workforce in many areas. The SIMs work as highly trained surgeons, staff at restaurants, and even child carers. The movie sets the scene from the start: as Nick struggles with the drama surrounding his job and a long wait for his wife Maggie to receive a heart transplant, he will have to rely on Alice to help with his children and tasks around the house. But what will happen when Alice starts to fear being replaced as the mother of the family and things turn deadly? This is a tale of AI-gone-wrong that you don't want to miss with an outstanding performance by Fox, who plays into the robotic eeriness so well. Till Death Megan Fox in Till Death Till Death takes the terrifying reality of a controlling relationship one step further when Emma (Megan Fox), a woman cheating on her husband, is forced into being handcuffed to her husband's corpse. Yes, you heard that right. Fox plays a brilliantly clever woman pushed into a survival situation as she realizes that her husband Mark (Eoin Macken) set the whole scene for her downfall. [RELATED – Emma is faced with an entire host of trials that her husband set up for her after his suicide – a cold house, hidden clothing, and calls made to some individuals who wish her harm. And don't forget the fact that she's forced to fight for her life while dragging around her husband's body, making this thriller full of disturbing twists and turns. As Emma faces the terror of her situation and is left to do some intense problem-solving, you'll be sitting at the end of your seat and cheering for the movie's heroine. Midnight in the Switchgrass Megan Fox as Rebecca Lombardo in Midnight in the Switchgrass Midnight in the Switchgrass is memorable to many Megan Fox fans not just because of its crime-fueled intensity as Fox takes on an FBI role, but also because this is where Fox would meet her future partner while filming, Machine Gun Kelly. Fox plays as an FBI agent named Rebecca Lombardo alongside agent Karl Helter (Bruce Willis) who begin investigating missing and murdered women in a small town in Florida. However, due to the risks that Lombardo takes on the job, Helter leaves the case and is joined by Byron Crawford (Emile Hirsch) in the investigation. When Lombardo and Crawford's paths are crossed with a serial killer, they are met with the reality that they will have to find him before more lives are lost, including that of a teenager named Tracey Lee (Caitlin Carmichael). More terror sets the scene when Lombardo is eventually abducted by the killer and has to do whatever she can to escape and save lives. This one is a real nail-biter that casts Fox in a role of bravery that you won't soon forget.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/movies/news/megan-fox-netflix-movies-stream-watch-subservience-till-death/

March 15, 2025 at 4:42 PM EDT By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, he said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, Boasberg added, noting they remain in government custody. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations of people — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.

- Advertisement - PRESS RELEASE Over 40 civil society representatives from 14 Caribbean states and overseas territories called for transformative and inclusive pathways to sustainable development at a Civil Society Summit on May 23-24, 2024, ahead of the Fourth International Conference for Small Island Development States (SIDS4) in Antigua and Barbuda. The Summit was co-hosted by the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute (CANARI) and the Environmental Awareness Group (EAG) to mobilise and prepare Caribbean civil society to effectively engage in dialogue on the new 10-year sustainable development agenda and its implementation at SIDS4. CANARI Executive Director, Nicole Leotaud, emphasised that, Caribbean civil society want to see a much more ambitious and progressive sustainable development agenda. They are calling for urgent attention on key issues like loss of biodiversity and ecosystems upon which our lives depend, putting human rights and justice at the centre of development, ensuring that an ocean-based economy is environmentally sustainable and benefits Caribbean people, and channelling climate finance to support locally led adaptation which addresses the needs of the most vulnerable and marginalised. EAG Antigua Marine Conservation Programme Coordinator, Miquel Garcia, agreed and noted that Civil society in SIDS act as a rallying point for persons most adversely affected by a changing world. As passionate advocates, we lead the charge to a sustainable and equitable society. While the content of the new 10-year agenda leaves much to be desired in terms of biodiversity and conservation specifically, the EAG will continue to lead the way for biodiversity conservation, restoration and stewardship in Antigua and Barbuda, in the same way civil society across the Caribbean will lead the way to a bright, prosperous and resilient future. whatsapp image 2024 05 29 at 10.24.49 am / Members of the EAG and Caribbean Affiliates The Breadfruit Collective founder and youth advocate, Christine Samwaroo, also noted We know the realities of climate injustice in the Caribbean and the urgency of actionable steps. The agenda document falls short in addressing the intersectional issues that climate justice brings. We need to see stronger language around gender justice, inclusive of sexual reproductive health rights, and we need to have gender transformative language throughout. We also need to protect our ecosystems in the face of major planned exploration of fossil fuels and other development in the Caribbean. The Summit builds on the virtual regional dialogues from January to February 2024 and the position paper developed by CANARI on The Caribbean We Want to capture Caribbean civil society recommendations on sustainable development priorities for the next 10 years. This process identified concrete priorities of, and recommendations from, Caribbean civil society to feed into development of the new 10-year agenda. It also sought to ensure that civil society priorities are included, and that civil society is recognised as a key partner in subsequent implementation. On the first day of the Summit, the civil society representatives analysed the new 10-year agenda – the Antigua and Barbuda Agenda for SIDS (ABAS) – and identified areas that were aligned to civil society priorities and could be leveraged, key needs for civil society that remain to be addressed, and areas where they were concerned. In particular, the discussions focused on the role that civil society is already playing in delivering sustainable development, and how this could be enabled and supported. On the second day, the focus was the SIDS Civil Society Action Plan and Roadmap that will be launched at a SIDS4 Special Event, the Civil Society Forum, on May 29, 2024. The Action Plan and Roadmap is aligned with and complementary to the ABAS, and outlines strategic roles for civil society in the Caribbean, Pacific and Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea regions in delivering sustainable development priorities and recommends actions to strengthen enabling institutional frameworks, practices and partnerships to better support these roles. Civil society representatives at the Summit reviewed and added their inputs to the final draft Action Plan and Roadmap to ensure it was reflective of the Caribbean's needs. Following the Summit, the civil society representatives will be attending the SIDS4 conference from May 27-30, 2024, and are aiming to engage with national governments, regional agencies and development partners to ensure real transformation towards inclusive, resilient and sustainable development in Caribbean and other SIDS. This work is supported by the Open Society Foundations and Institute of International Education.

President Donald Trump declared on Saturday that the United States is being invaded by the Venezuela-based gang Tren de Aragua and ordered for the deportation of all members of the gang who are residing in the country illegally. In a proclamation, Trump said Tren de Aragua, which is now a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization and was the target of extensive apartment raids in Colorado by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in early February, is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the U.S. at the direction of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his regime. It also describes Venezuela as giving more of its territory over to violent gangs, including Tren de Aragua, resulting in a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the U.S. Trump then invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of all Venezuelan illegal immigrants 14 years and older who are members of the gang, adding that they are a danger to the public peace or safety of the U.S. I proclaim that all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies, the proclamation states. The order comes just after a federal judge blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelan migrants with suspected ties to Tren de Aragua. The administration quickly appealed the ruling, with a hearing scheduled for Saturday afternoon.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/news/wex/trump-declares-invasion-by-tren-de-aragua-orders-deportation-of-illegal-gang-members/article_d2eed822-441c-56e9-bcfd-782c16b8e022.html
Jack Quaid has shared his enthusiasm for a Novocaine sequel, opening up about the possibility of a follow-up to the action thriller. Novocaine stars Quaid as Nathan Caine, a bank executive with congenital insensitivity to pain, who goes out to rescue his girlfriend after she is taken hostage by a group of bank robbers. The film was released over the past weekend and received a strong 82% score on Rotten Tomatoes, earning praise for its dark humor, sharp writing, and Quaid's standout performance. During ScreenRant's Coffee Chats episode 2 with the actor, Quaid discussed the potential for a sequel, revealing that he and directors Dan Berk and Robert Olson already have exciting ideas for a hypothetical Novocaine 2. While nothing has been officially greenlit, his comments indicate a strong desire to continue Nathan Caine's story. Read his full comment below: I would love it. There's so many ideas I have, there's so many ideas that I know Dan and Bobby have. It'd be really cool. So, I don't know, we'll pray to the movie gods to make that happen. What This Means For A Potential Novocaine 2 It Could Build On The First Film's Success Novocaine performed well critically and debuted at the top of the box office on its opening day, earning $3.9 million. The action film had an $18 million production budget and is projected to gross between $8 and $10 million over its opening weekend, placing it at the top of the weekend's box office, surpassing Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17. The film's 82% Rotten Tomatoes critic score and an 88% audience score signals strong critical and audience approval, meaning there could be interest in continuing the story. Given Quaid's passion for the project and the creative team's enthusiasm, it seems like there's creative energy behind the idea of Novocaine2. A sequel could explore what happens in Nathan's life after the unexpected plot twist in Novocaine's ending. The potential sequel could explore how his inability to feel pain affects his relationships and moral decisions and follow up on his dynamic with his love interest, Sherry Margrave (Amber Midthunder). If Novocaine 2 were to happen, it could capitalize on the success of its predecessor while continuing to offer a fresh take on action thrillers that keeps audiences engaged. Jack Quaid on the phone while hanging upside down from the ceiling in Novocaine Related Novocaine's big twist completely flips the script on one notable character, their history, and their actual role in the Jack Quaid-led action-comedy. One of the other main reasons why Novocaine 2 has a strong possibility of getting off the ground is the increased audience interest in one-man army action movies, particularly ones that involve unconventional heroes. David Harbour's Violent Night became a critical and commercial hit and has a sequel in the works, while anticipation similarly grows for Bob Odenkirk's Nobody 2. Since Quaid's movie has garnered the same level of acclaim as said titles, including higher than the Christmas action-comedy, a steady run at the box office would go a long way to securing its future. Our Take On Novocaine 2's Chances A Follow-Up Could Be A Smart Move While there is no official confirmation yet, Quaid's comments make it clear that there's genuine interest from the creative team for Novocaine 2. If the first movie's strong reception and audience demand continue to grow, the movie gods the actor referred to may just grant his wish. With the right script and creative vision, a sequel could not only match but even outperform the first film, delivering another fresh and original action film that takes audiences on an unpredictable ride.|2025-03-16|https://screenrant.com/novocaine-2-chances-jack-quaid-reesponse-encouraging/
US President Donald Trump ordered a series of airstrikes on Houthi rebel targets in Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, warning of overwhelming lethal force. In response, the Houthis vowed retaliation, stating that the attack will not pass without a response. According to Houthi officials, the strikes resulted in nine deaths and left nine others seriously wounded. The airstrikes mark the first US military action against the Houthis since Trump's administration began in January, following the rebels' attacks on Israel and Red Sea vessels amid the Gaza conflict, AFP reported. Houthi-run Al Masirah TV confirmed the attack on capital city Sanaa but provided no further details. Meanwhile, the Houthis' health and environment ministry, through the Saba news agency, stated, Nine civilians were killed, and nine others were injured, most of them seriously. Earlier, Trump posted on Truth Social his intention to use overwhelming lethal force until we have achieved our objective , citing the Huthis' threats to Red Sea shipping. The Huthis released a statement in response declaring that the strikes will not pass without response . This aggression will not pass without a response, and our Yemeni armed forces are fully prepared to confront escalation with escalation, the rebels' political bureau said in a statement on their Al-Masirah television. Trump had also demanded Iran cease support for the rebels immediately. The rebels, controlling substantial parts of Yemen for over ten years, belong to the pro-Iran axis of resistance groups opposing Israel and the United States. They have conducted numerous drone and missile strikes against vessels near Yemen in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden during the Gaza conflict, expressing solidarity with Palestinians. These actions disrupted the crucial shipping route, which typically handles 12 percent of global maritime traffic, compelling numerous companies to reroute around southern Africa. The US has conducted multiple strikes on Huthi positions, sometimes with British support. The Huthis suspended attacks during Gaza's January ceasefire but announced on Tuesday they would resume until Israel allows aid into Palestinian territory. Trump's communication avoided mentioning the Israel dispute, concentrating on previous Huthi attacks on commercial vessels. To all Huthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he said. Do NOT threaten the American People, their President... or Worldwide shipping lanes. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it! he added.|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/watch-us-launches-airstrikes-in-yemen-as-trump-vows-to-stop-houthi-attacks-rebels-react/articleshow/119057577.cms
After an east coast resident lashed out at local authorities for planting a native tree in front of his home—arguing that an exotic species would have been a better choice as it wouldn't grow too large or block sunlight—council has responded, defending its decision and explaining the reasoning behind the move. The Sydney man, from Leichhardt, accused Inner West Council this week of never being able to get anything right . He initially welcomed the tree-planting efforts, expecting more dwarf crepe myrtles to replace the damaging Chinese tallows. However, he unleashed after finding Illawarra flame trees instead, citing concerns over their height, potential to block sunlight and potential for skin irritation. Just another thing to stop your children touching, also rather expensive to buy. Whoever makes these decisions needs some common sense, he said in frustration. But speaking to Yahoo, a spokeswoman for the Inner West Council explained its current planting program uses species that are proven successful in urban environments and practical for the spaces. Council responds after local man's tree complaint The spokeswoman said trees in urban areas typically grow much smaller than in their natural habitat. ADVERTISEMENT Trees planted in urban environments do not reach the potential heights they do in their natural environments, she said. A tree that might reach 30m in its natural environment could only reach 10m in an urban environment. The Inner West Council's Tree Management Development Control Plan (DCP) provides the means of managing trees. The spokeswoman said the planting of trees on public land and approvals for private land are undertaken with regard for all the existing site factors . There is a place for both native trees and exotic species in the urban landscape to meet the requirements of any location, she said. Online, heated debate erupted over the planting of trees on public land, many praising the council. They're native, they look beautiful, and most of all, the contribute much needed shade, which is the entire point of the Tree DCP. A dwarf plant will not do that, one person wrote. Illawarra flame trees are a wonderful choice Great colour changing with seasons, provide shade, don't need much maintenance, echoed a second. ADVERTISEMENT But several people did agree with the man. Love my natives, but not a fan of Illawarra flame trees, one person stated. The goop after it rains is unbelievable. Looks like jellyfish exploded and it's slippery. You've made a very good point, commented a second. Another argued it serves you right for not participating in council's community consultation process. Why should we prioritise native species over introduced exotic alternatives? Australia faces one of the worst invasive species problems in the world, with non-native plants and animals wreaking havoc on ecosystems, agriculture, and native wildlife. Many exotic species, introduced intentionally or accidentally, have escaped into the wild and become aggressive pests, outcompeting native species, damaging landscapes, and altering entire ecosystems. From cane toads spreading across northern Australia to feral cats and foxes decimating native animal populations, the impact of invasive species is widespread and devastating. ADVERTISEMENT When it comes to planting trees and vegetation, prioritising native species over exotics is crucial in preventing further ecological damage. Native plants are adapted to Australia's unique climate and soils, requiring less water and maintenance while providing essential habitat and food sources for native birds, insects, and animals. Exotic species, however, can sometimes escape cultivation and spread uncontrollably, invading bushland and pushing out native flora. For example, introduced plants like lantana, blackberry and privet have become highly invasive, forming dense thickets that suffocate native vegetation and disrupt ecosystems. In addition to ecological concerns, escaped exotic species can also lead to practical issues for communities. Fast-growing, non-native trees may require constant maintenance to prevent damage to power lines, roads, and footpaths. Some exotic species also produce seeds, fruits, or pollen that can trigger allergies or pose risks to local wildlife. By planting native species where possible, Australia can help restore and maintain its natural landscapes while reducing the ongoing battle against invasive pests.|2025-03-16|https://au.news.yahoo.com/why-this-photo-has-aussie-fuming-at-council-cant-get-anything-right-225103077.html

Amnesty International on Friday called former Philippines President Rodrigo Rua Duterte's appearance before the International Criminal Court (ICC) a symbolic moment for the families of those killed during his administration's war on drugs. Amnesty International's Southeast Asia Researcher Rachel Chhoa-Howard stated: Rodrigo Duterte's appearance at the International Criminal Court is a sight families of the thousands of victims of the 'war on drugs' in the Philippines feared they would never see. Today shows that those accused of committing the worst crimes may one day face their day in court, regardless of their position. Chhoa-Howard further underscored the crucial role of the ICC in delivering accountability, saying it was a day of hope for families of victims and human rights defenders who have for years fought tirelessly for justice despite grave risks to their lives and safety. Duterte's first appearance at the ICC comes nearly six years after the Philippines formally withdrew from the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the ICC and determined its jurisdiction. Despite this withdrawal, the ICC retained jurisdiction over the alleged crimes committed by Duterte from November 1, 2011, to March 16, 2019, when he served as the mayor of Davao City and later as president. Duterte was arrested on March 11 in Manila upon returning from Hong Kong following a warrant issued by the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber. He now faces the charge of murder as a crime against humanity. The chamber initially authorized an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, including extrajudicial killings, reportedly committed in the context of Duterte's anti-drugs campaign. While the Philippines' withdrawal from the ICC took effect on March 17, 2019, the court has been collecting evidence on alleged crimes committed while the country was still a state party. Prosecutors allege that Duterte played a crucial role in orchestrating, encouraging, and enabling the killings of thousands of suspected drug offenders. Court documents also referenced his time as head of the so-called Davao Death Squad, an alleged vigilante group accused of extrajudicial executions when Duterte was the mayor of Davao City. During his initial appearance via video link, the ICC ensured that Duterte was informed of the murder charges against him and of his rights under the Rome Statute. Duterte's lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, stated that Duterte was too unwell to provide further comment, asserting that his arrest and transfer to the Netherlands amounted to pure and simple kidnapping and that his client was experiencing debilitating medical conditions. In response, Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc noted that the court doctor who assessed Duterte upon his arrival determined that Duterte was fully mentally aware and fit. She further clarified that Duterte and his legal team would have the opportunity to raise concerns regarding his transfer and health at a later stage in the proceedings. The ICC has provisionally scheduled the hearing on the confirmation of charges to begin on September 23, 2025.|2025-03-16|https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/03/former-philippines-president-duterte-appears-before-icc-over-alleged-crimes-against-humanity/

Screenshot: YouTube/FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth A University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) philosophy lecturer who was seen in a viral video harassing a Christian evangelist says he's been placed on administrative leave. In a video shared on March 9, Charles Hermes, a UTA undergraduate advisor and senior lecturer of Philosophy, is seen shouting No justice! at a street preacher during a pro-abortion rally in Fort Worth. The street preacher is heard asking, Do you believe in Jesus? to several bystanders in the video. At one point, Hermes stands in front of the unidentified preacher and says, I do, I believe in Jesus, as he presses his head close to the evangelist. As the video zooms in, the preacher, Bible in hand, says to Hermes, This is not your territory and continues to preach to the crowd. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. A campus reporter enters the frame and asks the preacher, Why are you here? The preacher replies, I am here because I was brought here. I am here because all the children that are dying. I am here because the blind and confusion that the devil has put everyone's heart, everyone's mind. The rally appeared to be part of a March 8 event from the Tarrant County Democratic Party titled International Women's Day Unite and Resist held outside the county courthouse to kick off Women's History Month by celebrating women's bodies and supporting autonomy. That same day, Hermes signaled in a Facebook post he would be attending the event, calling it a perfect day for the International Women's Day Marches. … Looking forward to Dallas's march. Just one day prior, on March 7, Hermes announced the university placed him on administrative leave. I don't know what to do. After 18 years of teaching at UTA I have been placed on administrative leave. I'm shocked and speechless. I'm scared. I can't stop crying, he said. So much of who I am comes from my love of our students. I guess I never thought this could happen. It's been such a hard semester, now this. I'm so scared and sad. A UTA spokesperson told The Christian Post Tuesday that Hermes was placed on administrative leave March 8 but declined further comment. Hermes' suspension follows several years of activism, including his arrest for criminal trespassing last May following his involvement in a pro-Palestinian rally. Hermes has been arrested three times in the last year for civil disobedience charges, local media outlet KERA notes. A March 7 letter from the chair of the UTA Philosophy and Humanities department cited by the outlet names numerous complaints over his courses and teaching as justification to place Hermes on leave. In 2018, Hermes was criticized for social media posts that appeared to condone harm to President Donald Trump during his first term in office. He later deleted the posts. That same year, right-wing commentator Steven Crowder accused Hermes of calling Crowder an alt-right Neo-Nazi, and alleged Crowder advocated for the murder and extermination of Jews and LGBT people. Hermes once reportedly spearheaded an online petition drive calling on the American Philosophical Association to prohibit schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation from posting open jobs with the organization's placement service. He reportedly launched the campaign in response to a statement of faith required by a potential employer. To avoid offending those Christians who love their neighbors, and who leave the judging for God, I will hereafter refer to statements like these as statements of discrimination instead of statements of faith, Hermes reportedly wrote.

Their bodies might have been screaming for mercy, but there was nowhere else a group of Manly Skiff Club greats would rather have been as they turned back the clock at the annual Old Buffers Day. Fourteen Manly alumni pulled on a wetsuit again to combine with the current fleet for a spin around the harbour before reminiscing over a beer or two back in the traditional post-race debrief back at headquarters. For the record, Modern Concept Constructions (Brian Hansen) was first across the line from Sutech Building (Dave Slennet), Imagine Signage (Robbie Treharne) and Shebang (Clare Hozack). Shebang parlayed that fourth-placed finish into a win on handicap. But the final placings matter little. It was all about reconnecting with a sport that stays in the bloodstream despite what the birth certificate might read. For Hozack, it was particularly poignant given she stepped away from the class seven years ago to confront some major challenges in life. I started sailing at Manly in 1996 at 15 in a F11 and filled in a lot in the 12ft skiffs and 16s during my late teens and early 20s, because my dad sailed them, she explained. I was part of the development team for the 13ft skiff, then I bought my first 16 when I was about 26. I sailed the 2011 Brisbane nationals while pregnant and then filled in a lot, almost every weekend and for States and Nationals, including the 2014 Drummoyne Nationals while pregnant again. Then, about seven years ago I developed cancer. I had to pull out of a race to get surgery. I had fairly major abdominal surgery then some mental health challenges and haven't really stepped on a 16 in that time. Old Buffers Day gave Clare the opportunity to reintroduce herself to the sport and the local sailing community. She said: It was an opportunity for someone that has literally fallen off the radar at Manly 16s to reingratiate myself with people I've known since I was a teenager. It was like riding a bike. I was a bit wobbly but the conditions were benign so it was a lot of fun. Contemporary Pools boasted the oldest crew, with a combined age of 180. But that didn't stop skipper Henry Harding (70), for 'and Pete Weapo Wettstein (65) and Andrew St John (45) from giving a bit of cheek. Wettstein, a two-time club champion, last sailed a skiff eight years ago and admitted to a fair bit of ring rust . The body was hurting Sunday morning – you don't realise all the different muscles you use in sailing, he said with a laugh. We capsized at one stage and neither Henry or I could get back on the board, but it was a lot of fun. Saint , in his usual position on the sheet, was the conduit between the present and the past. He said: The boys were a little rusty to start off but by the time the starter's gun went we were in some form of groove and enjoying our sail together. I really enjoyed sailing with two great mates and will remember the day for years to come. Old Buffers Day is not about the result but enjoying sailing these great boats with the guys that have sailed them before us. Amen to that.

Dr. Bob Arnot of Health Tech Without Borders told Newsmax Saturday that the ongoing debate in America about fluoride in public water systems is justified because ingesting too much can lead to serious health issues. If you get to higher doses, it can lower IQ in children. So developing children, it's, you know, it's a huge concern for parents, Arnot told Saturday Agenda. It's also a very big concern for older individuals who may have hip fractures — again, if they have those higher doses. And so it's rightly sort of left to individual communities.

An internal investigation has uncovered violations in the Ministry of Agriculture's (ZM) electric vehicle charging network procurement. The review was conducted in response to findings from the State Audit Office's report, Is the Ministry of Agriculture justified in establishing its own EV charging network? The investigation aimed to determine whether any ministry officials had committed offenses and whether they should be held disciplinarily accountable, the ministry explained. The Ministry reported that the procurement committee overseeing the project Planning, design, installation, and maintenance of the EV charging network had committed violations. However, ZM representatives pointed out that disciplinary action can only be initiated if no more than two years have passed since the offense or inaction occurred. Since the violations were committed more than two years before the State Audit Office's report, the officials involved in the procurement process cannot be held disciplinarily accountable. Officials who should have been responsible for overseeing the execution and subsequent control of the general agreement signed after the procurement process had already left the ministry by the time of the investigation. Consequently, under the Civil Service Disciplinary Liability Law, there is no basis for launching disciplinary proceedings. Additionally, the ministry's Public Procurement and Administrative Department referent cannot be held disciplinarily accountable under labour law, as more than 12 months have passed since the violation was committed. The Ministry also stated that in relation to investment projects under the priority measure Improvement of the Ministry of Agriculture's sectoral infrastructure and technical support for the ministry's functions, including investments in land reclamation systems and the Green Deal objectives, no violations by ministry officials were found, meaning there is no basis for disciplinary action. Upon reviewing the information gathered during the internal investigation, the committee concluded that the identified violations in the contract execution process were linked to a lack of time, human resources, and relevant specialists required for the project's implementation. Additionally, the State Audit Office has forwarded the regulatory violations outlined in its report to the Corruption Prevention and Combating Bureau (KNAB) and the Prosecutor General's Office for further evaluation. Previously, BNN reported that in the audit published on the 18th of July 2024, the State Audit Office concluded that the established EV charging network does not meet the Ministry's current and future fleet needs. Moreover, the charging stations installed are incompatible with the available technical infrastructure at the selected locations. The audit revealed that the unplanned 3.1 million euro charging network, financed from the 2022 state budget, is oversized and does not align with the Ministry's actual and future requirements. While the State Audit Office acknowledges ZM's intention to support the Green Deal, the findings suggest that in this case, the Green Deal was used as a cover for unjustified and wasteful spending of state funds. The ZM EV charging network consists of 52 charging stations at 42 locations, but an inappropriate technical solution was chosen for its implementation. The audit also found that the procurement committee's decision to install only high-power charging stations (above 22 kW) contradicts national policy planning documents and industry best practices. Following the completion of its internal investigation, KNAB has initiated criminal proceedings regarding possible legal violations related to the Ministry of Agriculture's EV charging network project.|2025-03-16|https://bnn-news.com/scandal-in-the-ministry-of-agricultures-ev-charging-network-procurement-violations-found-but-no-one-held-responsible-knab-steps-in-265765

City of Penticton officials this week issued a Request for Proposal (RFP), seeking operators for a pair of popular beach concession stands for at least the next three years. Operators are being sought at the Skaha East and Peach concession stands, according to the RFP which opened on March 14. These strategically located concessions offer locals and visitors convenient refreshment options during the summer, said Kelsey Johnson, the city's general manager of community services. The city says it hopes to award the RFP by May 1, so there is no interruption in service. Operators are being sought for a term of between three and five years, it added. Vallarta Fiesta Grill is the most recent operator of the Skaha East location, situated along the southern Penticton beach at 3885 South Main St. Family Squeezed Lemonade, meanwhile, has operated out of the Peach since 2022. It is located at 185 Lakeshore Dr. at Okanagan Beach. As the land where the buildings are located is dedicated parkland, the Parkland Protection and Use Policy requires any new agreements within parkland to follow a step-by-step procedure and receive a recommendation from the Parks and Recreation Advisory Committee to issue an RFP for renewing and selecting tenants, Johnson added. While operators will be responsible for utilities, day-to-day upkeep, safety and security of the building, the city says it will continue to be responsible for the surrounding grounds and nearby washrooms, and major maintenance. There are four beach concessions buildings in Penticton, with Sudbury Beach and Skaha Main representing the other two. Operator contracts for those stands expire on Sept. 30, 2028.

Surgery has evolved significantly—from open procedures to minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, and now, the rise of robotic-assisted surgery. But a key question remains: Will robots ever replace human surgeons? The short answer is NO. Robotics in surgery is an advanced tool, but it cannot function independently of human expertise, judgment, and skill. How robotic surgery works In laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon directly controls the instruments with their hands. In robotic surgery, the surgeon still remains in control, but instead of holding the instruments directly, they manipulate robotic arms that perform the movements with greater precision. According to Dr. Arpit Bansal, advanced laparoscopic and cancer surgeon, The procedure begins with the surgeon manually inserting small laparoscopic ports into the body. These ports act as entry points for the surgical instruments. Once in place, the robotic system is docked onto these ports, securing the robotic arms to the patient. This docking process allows the surgeon to control the instruments remotely from a console, enabling greater flexibility, precision, and stability during surgery. The key advantage of using robots in surgery: Precision and AI Integration The primary advantage of robotic surgery over traditional laparoscopy is its enhanced precision, especially in complex procedures. Robotic systems allow for finer movements, reducing errors and improving patient outcomes. AI tools are also being integrated into robotic surgery, benefiting both surgeons and patients. For example, in France, a global leader in laparoscopy, AI is being combined with real-time, high-definition CT and MRI scans to guide surgical procedures. These live imaging tools provide surgeons with a detailed, real-time view of the patient's anatomy, allowing for more precise navigation during surgery. Robots as Assistants, Not Replacements While robotic and AI advancements are transforming surgery, they will never replace human surgeons. Robots serve as enhanced tools, not decision-makers. The surgeon remains responsible for critical decision-making, problem-solving, and adapting to unexpected challenges during surgery. The future of robotic surgery lies in collaboration. Robots will assist, not replace, surgeons, particularly in complex and longer procedures where precision is crucial. The integration of AI, robotics, and human expertise will continue to refine surgical techniques, leading to safer, more effective procedures for patients worldwide. Surgical robots gain popularity and scrutiny|2025-03-16|https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/the-future-of-surgery-will-robots-replace-surgeons/articleshow/119055279.cms

The UFC is at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas for tonight's fights. The UFC Vegas 104 fight card features a middleweight rematch for its main event. In that contest, Marvin Vettori and Roman Dolidze run back their 2023 meeting, a three-round affair that Vettori won via unanimous decision. In the UFC Vegas 104 co-main event, Chidi Njokuani and Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos look to break into the light heavyweight rankings with a victory. Below, we will update the UFC Vegas 104 fight card results, video highlights, scorecards, and more live throughout tonight's main fight card. The full UFC Vegas 104 fight card streams on ESPN+. UFC Tonight: UFC Vegas 104 Fight Card - Marvin Vettori Vs. Roman Dolidze 2 Marvin Vettori (19-7-1) returns to the UFC Octagon for the first time since he dropped a unanimous decision to Jared Cannonier in June 2023. That fight followed his March 2023 decision win over Roman Dolidze. An injury knocked Vettori out of a scheduled April 2024 matchup against Brendan Allen. Vettori enters UFC Vegas 104 as the No. 8 ranked fighter in the official UFC middleweight rankings. Vettori opened his UFC career in 2016. He went 2-2-1 in his first five fights with the promotion. Following a split decision loss to future UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya in April 2018, Vettori put together a five-fight unbeaten streak. That run earned him a rematch against Adesanya, who by then held the UFC's 185-pound belt. Adesanya won that contest via decision. Vettori is 2-2 since his loss to Adesanya. Roman Dolidze (14-3) enters UFC Vegas 104 as the No. 11 UFC middleweight.Dolidze joined the promotion in July 2020 going 2-1 in his first three outings with the UFC. Dolidze followed a March 2021 decision loss to Trevin Giles with a four-fight winning streak. That run ended with his loss to Vettori. A majority decision setback to Nassourdine Imavov followed. Dolidze followed that lackluster performance with a decision win over Anthony Smith at UFC 303. In his most recent trip to the cage, Dolidze scored a TKO win over Kevin Holland in a bout where Holland could not continue because of broken ribs.

Dolidze 1 The first matchup between these two middleweights was a fairly evenly matched striking battle. The difference in the fight came down to activity and output. Vettori attempted 218 significant strikes and landed 106 for a success rate of 48 percent. Meanwhile, Dolidze threw 192 significant strikes and connected 71 times for a landing rate of 36 percent. Vettori might not have thrown with his opponent's power, but he used effective combinations, while Dolidze relied more on single power strikes. Vettori also did a good job mixing up his techniques and targets, landing 38 leg strikes, eight body strikes, and 60 head strikes. Dolidze spent most of the fight headhunting, with 52 of his significant strikes landing upstairs on Vettori. UFC Tonight: UFC Vegas 104 Main Event: Marvin Vettori On Roman Dolidze I smashed my shoulder. It popped out and destroyed my rotator cuff, my labrum, and even my bicep, Vettori said (Via MMA Mania). It was a heavy surgery, you know. A lot of tendons were torn and messed up. Tendons take a while to heal. It's good to be back, Vettori added. After my last fight, I thought I needed some time off, so I switched gyms [from Xtreme Couture] and joined American Top Team. I started training for another fight, but then I got injured...this injury took me basically a year. I thought I could recover in three months with P.T. [physical therapy], but I actually made it worse and ended up needing surgery in June. I got injured [last] March, and I'm finally coming back now. UFC Tonight: UFC Vegas 104 Main Event: Roman Dolidze On Marvin Vettori He hasn't fought in a long time, Dolidze said (via MMA Junkie). Everybody says maybe it's bad for him, he hasn't fought in so long. But I never think about the fights from this point of view. I just understand that we are all changing, evolving. Maybe he has time to change something in his game. But anyway, I still think this fight can be the same, how he was working and what he was doing with me. Because I have power. He knows. Everybody knows I'm powerful. Everybody knows my ground game and grappling. That's why it's always hard to find keys with me. But I still think that I need to be more calm and control my anger, and that's the key to win this fight. UF Tonight: UFC Vegas 104 Main Event: Vettori Vs. Dolidze 2 Predictions And Picks Roman Dolidze is the better all-around fighter in this contest. The problem with Dolidze is that he doesn't use his full skill set inside the Octagon. Instead of employing his grappling skills, he seems most interested in getting in slugfests. While fans might not mind that style, Dolidze employs that approach to the detriment of his career. With that being said, Dolidze has been far more active than Vettori, and he has shown the ability to pick up his output and accuracy while mixing up his targets and techniques. With that, the betting pick is that Dolidze will beat Vettori at UFC Vegas 104 via decision.

Dolly Parton has made her first public appearance since her husband, Carl Dean, died at the age of 82. The country icon turned up in person at the 2025 opening of Dollywood on Friday (March 14), putting aside her personal troubles to smile and wave at fans who had traveled from all over the country to be there. Parton's official social media accounts shared video of the legendary entertainer waving to fans as they enjoyed opening day: The appearance marks the first time Parton has appeared in public since her husband of nearly 60 years, Carl Dean, died. Carl Dean died on March 3, 2025, at the age of 82. He and Parton wed in May of 1966, so they were just months away from their 59th anniversary at the time of his death. Dean's cause of death has not been disclosed, but various reports have speculated that he battled Alzheimer's in the last years of his life. Parton revealed in a 2022 interview that she would probably never tour again, citing her need to remain close to home because something could happen. 98.1 The Hawk logo Get our free mobile app Parton turned to social media to share an emotional statement after her husband's death, writing, This is a love note to family, friends, and fans.

I can't reach out personally to each of you but just know that it has meant the world to me. He is in God's arms now and I am okay with that. I will always love you. Parton also posted a very special song that she dedicated to her husband's quiet strength and support over the years titled If You Hadn't Been There.

It had been set next to a hole in a fence and surrounded by brickwork, funnelling cats entering through the hole to walk directly into the trap. These are barbaric devices that inflict terrible injuries and cause enormous suffering, RSPCA SA Chief Inspector Andrew Baker said. It's tragic to think that some animals could become trapped and never found, leaving them to die in agony. One of the cat's toes had to be amputated after being crushed in the illegal trap.

From RSPCA's perspective, there's no good reason to own a steel-jaw trap, he said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

A US-UK aggression launched airstrikes on the capital, Sana'a, on Saturday night. Yemeni sources confirmed that the strikes targeted a residential area in the Shaoub district, located north of the city. This attack follows the expiration of the deadline set by Ansarullah leader Sayyed Abdul Malik Badreddine Al-Houthi for the Zionist entity to lift its siege on the Palestinian people in Gaza and allow humanitarian aid into the region. Nasser Al-Din Amer, an Ansarullah leader, affirmed that Sana'a will remain Gaza's shield and support, pledging not to abandon it despite any challenges. He stressed that the aggressors will ultimately face the consequences, with victory reserved for the righteous. The Yemeni Armed Forces had announced on Tuesday the resumption of maritime operations targeting Israeli vessels and those heading to occupied Palestinian ports in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. BREAKING US warplanes launch airstrikes on the Yemeni capital Sanaa. pic.twitter.com/m8xKGZ0ehd — The Cradle (@TheCradleMedia) March 15, 2025 Trump Announces Military Action Against Yemen This escalation came after US President Donald Trump declared that the US had initiated a decisive and powerful military action against Yemen. In a post on social media, Trump stated, We will use overwhelming lethal force until we achieve our goal, accusing Ansar Allah of threatening shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Trump also called on Iran to immediately stop supporting Ansarullah, warning, Do not threaten the American people, their president, or global maritime routes. He added, If you do, beware, as America will hold you fully accountable, and we will not offer you gifts. 9 Martyrs and 9 Injured The Ministry of Health and Environment in Sana'a announced that 18 civilians had been martyred or injured as a result of the airstrikes targeting residential areas in the capital. According to the ministry's initial toll, 9 civilians were martyred, and 9 others were wounded, many of them critically. The ministry condemned the attack on civilians and civilian infrastructure, describing it as a war crime and a blatant violation of international laws and conventions. Sources in Yemen reported significant damage to several residential buildings in the Shaoub district due to the US-UK airstrikes. Civil defense teams continue to work in the affected areas. Palestinian Factions Condemn Aggression on Sana'a The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) strongly condemned the criminal US-UK airstrike aggression that targeted a residential area in the Yemeni capital, Sana'a. Hamas considered it a blatant violation of international law and an assault on Yemen's sovereignty and stability. The movement expressed full solidarity with Yemen and its people, praising their efforts in supporting the resilience of the Palestinian people in Gaza amid the ongoing genocide that shocks humanity. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement also condemned the blatant US aggression on Yemen, describing it as brazen support for the Zionist entity and its crimes against the Palestinian people and other regional nations, especially in Syria and Lebanon. The movement emphasized that this malicious aggression is part of the broader effort to protect the Israeli entity and attack those who stand with the Palestinian people in their fight against the brutal occupation crimes. Islamic Jihad also highlighted its pride in Yemen's honorable stance, which reflected an authentic Arab and Islamic position in support of Gaza and the Palestinian people and their resistance. The movement sent its regards to Yemen, both its people and leadership, for their resilience in the face of this assault. Source: Al-Manar Website|2025-03-16|https://english.almanar.com.lb/2361350
The Hobbit was adapted into a new blockbuster movie franchise in the 2010s, but never lived up to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies, due to some crucial missteps during development and production. The trilogy that dominated pop culture at the beginning of the 2000s changed the fantasy genre with its unprecedented scale, production value, epic storytelling, and a slew of Oscar wins, culminating in Best Picture for Return of the King in 2004. However, the comparison between the Oscar nominations received by the two trilogies alone demonstrates that The Hobbit is simply lacking something. The Hobbit movies are sometimes as good as The Lord of the Rings, with a return to the magical yet foreboding setting of Middle-earth, and themes of taking up an adventure to better the world around yourself. However, the source material is fundamentally different, with The Hobbit being based on a single shorter fairytale-inspired book versus a three-part epic saga. The Hobbit has been criticized for its bloated runtime and unnecessary plot elements, but it also fell into the trap of trying to be both like its original text and the previous award-winning movies. The Hobbit Trilogy Couldn't Decide If It Wanted To Be Like The Book Or The LOTR Movies Different Points In The Hobbit Movies Lean Into The Book Or The LOTR Trilogy The Hobbit is a succinct, to-the-point story, and was written with a younger audience in mind than The Lord of the Rings. It is ultimately much more lighthearted and, at times, much goofier, with unexpected dinner parties, slapstick conflicts with trolls, and characters engaged in riddle competitions. There is some tragedy towards the end, but it is more about Bilbo's self-realization and his going on an adventure than the wider-reaching conflict of The Lord of the Rings— as the title The Hobbit suggests. At least in the beginning, The Hobbit as an adaptation was committed to this difference. Infamously, Guillermo del Toro was supposed to helm a two-part The Hobbit adaptation before Peter Jackson stepped back into the role as director and the story was overhauled. However, when this happened, much of the whimsical and more faithful nature of what del Toro's movies could have been was thrown out. The Hobbit started to lean more into trying to recreate The Lord of the Rings, but certain moments show the filmmakers trying to have it all and making it unclear what tone they want to achieve. The Hobbit Movies Trying To Emulate Both Ensured They Didn't Reach The Heights Of Either Sequences In The Hobbit Movies Stand In Opposition To Each Other The first The Hobbit movie starts with a cheerier tune than Fellowship of the Ring, suggesting a cozier atmosphere — but then goes right into the CGI-laden flashback of the dwarves' kingdom being overthrown. Things like the dwarves' upbeat song mocking Bilbo and the confrontation with the trolls are silly, but the battles with the Orcs and the appearances of characters like Galadriel (Cate Blanchette) and Elrond (Hugo Weaving) are clearly trying to emulate the older movies. And so, these different aspects distract from each other and neither comes across the way it is supposed to. Movie Rotten Tomatoes Score The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) 92% The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002) 95% The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) 94% The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) 64% The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013) 74%|2025-03-16|https://screenrant.com/hobbit-movies-tone-problem-decide-copy-book-lotr-movies-op-ed/

Ramesh Savaikar Bicholim With various communities celebrating traditional Shigmo across the state, the Ghodemodni dance holds a significant place within the festival. Ghodemodni is a notable warrior dance form performed particularly by the Maratha community who migrated from the Ghat region of Maharashtra to Goa. The people of this community are settled along Maharashtra-Goa border in the villages of Mulgao, Bordem, Bicholim, Latambarcem, Kharpal, Kudchirem, Sarvan, Virdi, Matne, Amadgaon (Maharashtra) besides Ibrampur, Hankhane and Morjim in Pernem taluka. In all these villages, the tradition of Ghodemodni has been maintained by the community. Ghodemodni in Bordem is performed on the third day after Holi Pournima. This year, it will be held on March 16. The performance will be staged by the community members associated with Shri Sateri Ravalnath Devasthan located in the village. During the performance, the members of the dance troupe, dressed as warriors with turbans, hold a wooden effigy of a horse fixed to a bamboo shaft covered with coloured cloths. Wielding swords in their right hand, they march toward the village temple, dancing to the beats of 'dhol' and 'tashe.' They pretend to be seated on horses as they dance. Members of Ravalnathkar, Mahamayakar, Madhval and Saterikar Ghodemodni troupes dress up and go to 'Chavvhata', offer prayers there and then return back to' 'Gavtad', where the warrior dance begins. After offering prayers to Borde Vadeshwar at 'Vadakaden', the performers proceed in a procession of the revellers, dancing to the beats of dhol and tashe. The procession proceeds through Bhayli Peth up to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Circle and returns back. This way, they make three or five rounds. Hundreds of people throng to Bordem to witness the spectacular dance form, which has remained popular across the state. Ghodemodni troupes then return to Chavvhata, where puja is performed. Then they proceed to Gavtad, and get dispersed. Ghodemodni in Mulgao will also be held on March 16. The festival here is also associated with Shri Sateri Ravalnath Devasthan. One dancer each from Raut, Parab, Gad and Chari communities have the right and honour to participate the dance. From Sateri temple, the troupe proceeds to Ravalnath temple and then to Manasbagwada. Then the troupe returns to a place called 'Rayat,' wherein it takes five rounds of firewood arranged for a bonfire. Puja is performed and then it is set alight. The troupe members take a dip in the Santeri temple tank and proceed to Manasbag, and later disperse. Ghodemodni in the five villages, namely Bicholim (Shri Shantadurga Ravalnath), Sarvan (Shri Sateri –Shyampurush), Mayem (Mahamaya), Latambarsem (Sateri-Kelbai) and Kudchire will be held on March 17. Ghodemodni in Sarvan is held during night time. The youngsters accompanying the Ghodemodni troupe here carry with them 'chud' (flame) amid shouts of 'Haiyya-Ho, Ho-Haiyya' to the dhol beats. After the culmination of Ghodemodni, those observing 'vrat' perform 'agnidivya' (walking barefoot on embers). This is unique to Ghodemodni festival of the Sarvan village.|2025-03-16|https://www.navhindtimes.in/2025/03/16/goanews/warrior-dance-ghodemodni-lends-dynamic-element-to-shigmo-festivities/

Broken Sidewalk) American Printing House for the Blind / American Printing House for the Blind. (Branden Klayko / Broken Sidewalk) The American Printing House for the Blind has built a new grand entrance to their facility on Frankfort Avenue in the Clifton neighborhood which was dedicated in June and has now had some time to settle in. We stopped by and snapped a few photos of the project and learned a little bit about the architectural history of the campus, too. American Printing House for the Blind First, here's the story behind the APH from their web site: The American Printing House for the Blind is the world's largest company devoted solely to researching, developing, and manufacturing products for people who are blind or visually impaired. Founded in 1858, it is the oldest organization of its kind in the United States. Under the 1879 federal Act to Promote the Education of the Blind, APH is the official supplier of educational materials for visually impaired students in the U.S. who are working at less than college level. A new brick sidewalk with leads to the building entrance, but along the way new stainless steel and limestone benches line the well-lit path along with a sleek new outdoor sitting area. All the signage incorporates Braille script (although we're not sure how useful the main sign with mega-braille, above, will be to the passers by, it still looks really nice!) and the entire walk has a definite tactile quality about it. Information kiosks dot the front yard explaining the history of the facility. One panel about the architecture of the campus caught our attention: Although APH looks like one large building, it is really fourteen! The original 1883 factory, designed by Charles Clarke, was a three story Italianate brick structure. That building is largely hidden today. You can see hints of its appearance behind the right side of the main building. The public face of APH on Frankfort Avenue was built in 1955, and expanded in 1970. Louisville architect Arthur Tafel designed it in the International Style, also known as Bauhaus. We felt compelled to investigate this hidden 19th century factory, and just as the sign indicates, a corner of the original structure peaks through several layers of additions (photo below). The modern APH facility is really quite large and lends a distinctly pleasant urban quality to the surrounding neighborhood. Inside, a museum featuring a new exhibit detailing the APH's 150 years of service and innovation is available for tours. Overall, the new entrance adds a needed modern gesture to the campus, indicating the modern nature of the industry. The clean lines and graceful arcs in the outdoor space make a welcome addition to the sometimes hectic street life of the Frankfort Avenue corridor.

Toronto police said they received a call for a kidnapping in the area of East Liberty Street and Hanna Avenue on July 31. The suspects, a man and a youth, were in a rideshare vehicle when they allegedly produced a handgun and threatened the driver. They then forced the driver to sit with his head down on the passenger side of his vehicle, police said. The suspects drove the car to an unknown location, where they allegedly forced the victim to retrieve a stolen vehicle and took his cellphone and car keys. After the stolen vehicle was retrieved, the suspects used it to flee and left the victim behind, police said. Investigators executed three search warrants in Toronto and Oshawa months later, which resulted in a youth being taken into custody and an extended 30-round magazine, ammunition and a quantity of crystal methamphetamine being seized. The youth, who cannot be named under the provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, is facing 11 charges, including kidnapping for ransom of service, robbery with a firearm, forcible confinement and three counts of failure to comply with release order. Meanwhile, the second suspect, identified as 21-year-old Jordan Boodram, has not been located. He is wanted for several offences, including kidnapping for ransom of service, uttering threats, robbery with a firearm and three counts of failure to comply with probation. On Saturday, police released a photo of Boodram, who is described as five-foot-eight, 119 pounds, with a medium build, short black hair and a short black beard. Investigators are asking anyone with information to contact them at 416-808-1400 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS (8477) or www.222tips.com.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/local/toronto/2025/03/15/youth-arrested-man-wanted-after-toronto-rideshare-driver-kidnapped-forced-to-retrieve-stolen-vehicle/

 Jun 6 2025 - Oct 12 2025  Ljubljana The 36th Ljubljana Biennial of Graphic Arts is being curated by artistic director Chus Martínez, a renowned Spanish curator, lecturer and researcher. The list of participating artists will be announced early in 2025. The theme of the latest edition of the biennial is The Oracle with the biennial aiming to be a place of reflection on how art can renew trust in freedom, freedom of expression, solidarity and support for art and culture. Martinez says that with very few exceptions, she decided to work with artists she has never worked with before. In that sense, the work and the situation are new for everyone: the artists, myself, and the audience. I feel this provokes in me a sense of curiosity and also takes me out of my comfort zone, assuming a risk that culture and art should always assume: the importance of constantly trusting artists and their work, the condition of being explorative and open. She also took an interest in fantasy. Like some of the technologies that are being developed - AI, to name the most obvious - fantasy has not been very present in the artistic discourse because we feel we lack control over it. Only now can we perceive a growing interest among many artists worldwide to return to fantasy as an ally to gain eloquence in the public sphere and a sense of charisma to address fundamental subjects. I would like to explore with artists the way fantasy offers a language to engage with the social, she says. Organised by MGLC, the International Centre of Graphic Arts, the biennial will take place at Tivoli Mansion, the Gallery of Modern Art, Ljubljana City Gallery and the Jakopič Promenade leading from the Modern Gallery to the Tivoli Mansion.

Eddie Goldman has had an unusual path through his NFL career, including opting out of the COVID year and retiring before making a comeback in Atlanta a year ago. Now he has joined the Commanders as they try to improve their defensive fortunes following a dramatic and successful inaugural season for Adam Peters, Dan Quinn and Jayden Daniels. Goldman spoke to the media on Saturday morning. LIVE: DT Eddie Goldman speaks to the media after signing https://t.co/SbHshiUCN0— Washington Commanders (@Commanders) March 15, 2025 Who is DQ? Is that defensive quality control? Eddie Goldman had everyone smiling before he even got started on his media session. Once things kicked off officially, though, Goldman was all business, giving direct and concise answers to questions, with very little expansion. Asked about the free agency process, Goldman said that the Commanders 'reached out' and described the decision as a 'no-brainer', adding that Washington had been his favorite team as a child (he's from DC). Later in the media session he added that is means a lot to come home to play, and used the word 'surreal'. He said his strongest memories of the team growing up were the drought , which he went on to explain referred to years of losing and 'a lot of hardships' for the franchise. Referring to Jayden Daniels, Goldman said that the team rallies behind him. He said that he hasn't met Daniels yet, but added that he definitely knows how to work his magic — especially late in the game . Like most new arrivals, Goldman professed that he is ready to do whatever the coaches need him to do. He explained that his decision to retire and then return to the NFL had to do with 'off the field stuff', adding that he wants to keep his personal life personal, but that his business is handled and he's back. He feels as if the time off means that his body is fresh, and he has no issues being ready to play. Like many of his fellow recently signed free agent teammates, Golman said that the Commanders appeared, from the outside, to be a tight knit group, adding that you can't find that in every NFL organization. He stressed that every year is different and that he understands the need to build success afresh every year. All in all, Eddie Golman seems to be a man of few words who is happy to be here and ready to work.|2025-03-16|https://www.hogshaven.com/2025/3/15/24386658/eddie-goldman-presser-i-dont-know-jayden-daniels-yet-but-he-definitely-knows-how-to-work-his-magic
The Rolling Stones were unkempt, rebellious, and viewed as obscene. To the public, The Beatles were everything The Rolling Stones were not. Another set of artists to follow this rivalrous dichotomy were Prince and Michael Jackson. Both musicians were at the top of their games during the same decades, and they both toiled within the same genres. Thus, Prince always lived in the shadow of Michael Jackson. And, if you know Prince, you know that didn't sit well with him. Videos by American Songwriter The rivalry between the two spanned decades and was heavily documented, dramatized, and speculated. However, there is one story that has been vetted by Prince's longtime collaborator, Allan Leeds. It pertains to a seemingly innocent offer Michael Jackson proposed to Prince involving his acclaimed single, Bad . Why The Prince Refused The King Prior to Michael Jackson dropping Bad in 1987, both he and Prince had already defined their rivalry. As a matter of fact, in 1985, Prince had already turned down Michael Jackson once. He refused to perform on Jackson's iconic charity single, We Are The World . With that in mind, it seems as though Michael Jackson's second offer was not a genuine one. Rather, it seems like he was just trying to poke His Purpleness and perpetuate their rivalry. It's a shame that no one will ever know the true motivation behind Jackson's proposal. What we do know is that Jackson's offer did not please the Purple Rain singer. Allan Leeds attested to that fact. Michael [Jackson] coming to Prince and wanting him to do 'Bad', that really pissed him off, Leeds told Vibe Magazine. Prince was like, 'Oh, he wants me to punk out on record. Who does he think I am, crazy?' He probably couldn't get outside himself enough to realise that it was the kind of thing that probably could have benefited both of them. Despite the lack of Prince's presence, Michael Jackson's Bad still became an insanely successful pop single. Following its 1987 release, Bad peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, Hot R&B Singles, and Hot Dance Club Play charts. Could Prince have benefited from this? Yes, of course. But artists are artists, and what makes them that way are their ideals and convictions. Prince was never a sell-out. So, kudos to him for being true to himself and standing by his word in the face of success!|2025-03-16|https://americansongwriter.com/how-an-innocent-offer-from-michael-jackson-deepened-a-feud-with-prince/

1 injured in armed carjacking in south Seattle The victim said he was sleeping in his car when two armed men approached him and told him they were going to take it. Credit: fergregory - stock.adobe.com SEATTLE — One man was injured during an armed carjacking early Saturday morning in the SODO neighborhood in Seattle. A Seattle police officer was dispatched to 3100 Airport Way South at around 5:32 a.m., to a report that a person had been shot. When the officer arrived, he found one victim with a gunshot wound. The victim said he had been sleeping in his car, a black Dodge Dakota parked on South Stevens Street, when he was awoken by two men, one armed with a rifle and the other with a handgun. The men told the victim they were taking his truck, and then one of the suspects shot him. The victim said he didn't know either suspect, and he wasn't sure which direction they fled after the carjacking. SPD did not provide a plate number. One handgun shell casing was recovered from the scene and taken into evidence.|2025-03-16|https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/1-injured-in-armed-carjacking-in-south-seattle/281-d1277078-8b1b-4ecf-96ea-8b6408d4beef
Boise State University is being investigated for alleged race-based exclusion in graduate programs Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was created to prevent discrimination. It's being evoked as the basis for the investigations. Credit: Troy Colson / KTVB BOISE, Idaho — Boise State University is under federal investigation for allegedly engaging in race-exclusionary practices in its graduate programs. Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the color of their skin. We will not yield on this commitment, said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) included Boise State among 45 universities facing scrutiny under Title VI following a February directive reminding educational institutions of their obligations to eliminate racial preferences in their programs. Boise State University's Director of Media Relations, Stephany Galbreaith, responded to KTVB's request for comment. We received the letter and we are working with our general counsel's office to look into the matter, Galbreaith said. The probe centers on allegations that these institutions violated civil rights law by partnering with The Ph.D. Project, which provides doctoral students with networking opportunities and guidance but reportedly limits eligibility based on race. The investigations follow OCR's February 14 Dear Colleague Letter instructing federally funded educational institutions to stop using race as a factor in admissions, hiring, scholarships and other activities. The department released additional guidance on March 1 to address questions about the directive. In recent years, American educational institutions have discriminated against students on the basis of race, including white and Asian students, many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds and low-income families. These institutions' embrace of pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences and other forms of racial discrimination have emanated throughout every facet of academia, the letter states. In addition to the Boise State investigation,theOCR is examining six universities for allegedly awarding impermissible race-based scholarships and one university for allegedly operating a program that segregates students by race. Violations of Title VI, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin in federally funded programs, could result in the loss of federal funding. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was created to ensure public funds were not used to discriminate and to stop discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance.|2025-03-16|https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/boise-state-investigated-for-alleged-race-based-exclusion-in-graduate-programs-university/277-9e3250b2-a928-46c4-bdda-30a22e00c30f
LINWOOD, Kan. (KCTV) - A team of rescuers successfully saved a pair of adult beavers who became stranded near an area lake during an attempt to save a juvenile who passed away. Operation Wildlife, based in Linwood, Kansas, says it recently received an email from a couple who found a family of beavers stranded in an area spillway. The couple tried multiple strategies to rescue them but were unsuccessful. Organization leaders noted that they asked for photos of the beavers and their surroundings so they could be sent to Animal Search and Rescue Training and Response. However, after 24 hours with no response, they decided to take a road trip and find the stranded critters. Rescuers said three beavers were found midway down a quarter-mile-long concrete spillway with multiple 3-foot tall steps and walls that were 80 ft. high and 50 ft. across. When members of the rescue party made it to the family, they indicated that they believed a juvenile had gotten into the spillway as two adults attempted to rescue it. Ultimately, the young beaver was found to be deceased. According to Operation Wildlife, as the beavers were found on the property of a state fishing lake, a rescue plan would need to gain the approval of state conservationists. The plan came together with the help of ASAR and was approved by officials. With volunteer Kirk Mata's help, rescuers said they set off to the lake. Both adult beavers were successfully removed from the spillway, however, they shredded the equipment used to rescue them. While both beavers were hungry, they were found to be otherwise healthy and left to continue their lives at the lake. Operation Wildlife has asked for donations to help replace the shredded equipment. To offer donations or to learn more about Operation Wildlife, click HERE.

President Donald Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 Saturday to target members of a Venezuelan gang for mass deportations, just hours after a federal judge in Washington ruled that Trump couldn't use the law as a means to deport five Venezuelans. Trump claims the U.S. is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang – Tren de Aragua (TdA) – and the sweeping war time law will give the president broader leeway to deport what he says is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela's government. What they're saying: I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States, Trump wrote in the declaration. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and conducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United States both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. Expand US President Donald Trump speaks to the press before boarding Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base March 14, 2025, in Maryland. Trump is spending the weekend at his Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 (Photo b Trump's invocation of the law could allow for faster mass deportations of people in the country illegally – potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798? The backstory: The Alien Enemies Act allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a country that is considered an enemy of the United States during wartime. Congress passed the Alien Enemies Act as part of the four Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 when the U.S. was about to go to war with France. The law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used, but Trump appears to have invoked the law without such declaration. The sweeping authority of the Alien Enemies Act may sidestep a law that bans the military from civilian law enforcement. Why did Trump invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798? Dig deeper: On Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington – before Trump invoked the law – contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a predatory incursion by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts. James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was to preserve the status quo. Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. Trump had widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act. The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it will likely face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime. The other side: Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport, said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night. When was the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 last used? The controversial law was last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2.

Holy Perkins, Founder of Women's Strength Nation, shares her enthusiasm: I've always valued chlorophyll for its supportive properties and its ability to counteract the toxins we encounter daily, helping me stay alkaline. Right now, I'm loving Chlorophyll Water because it's a convenient grab-and-go option, plus it offers the added benefits of purified water and essential vitamins. Lisa Richards, a certified nutritionist and wellness author, highlights its effectiveness: Chlorophyll Water is an innovative way to consume chlorophyll, offering protection against free radicals while also aiding in weight management and improving red blood cells—thanks to chlorophyll's powerful antioxidant properties.|2025-03-16|https://www.bevnet.com/pr/2025/02/18/chlorophyll-water-set-to-debut-new-aluminum-cans--1l-bottle-at-natural-products-expo-west
Dayton has knocked off some highly ranked opponents this season. Now, the Flyers will be wearing the tag of a nationally ranked team this week.It's another stretch with notable matchups for No. 22 Dayton, which takes on visiting UNLV on Tuesday night. Keep the main thing the main thing and not make too much out of one game, Dayton coach Anthony Grant said. We haven't arrived yet. We're not a finished product. Tuesday is a different challenge. We've got to be ready for that challenge. Dayton knocked off then-No. 6 Marquette 71-63 on Saturday. Coupled with last month's conquering of then-No. 2 UConn, the Flyers have knocked off two teams with top-six national rankings for the first time since 1967. We have things that we believe in, and I'm just proud of the guys sticking to that, Grant said.In the UNLV game, Dayton (9-2) will be aiming for its 25th consecutive homecourt victory. When we play big games, they're like another teammate out there helping us out, guard Javon Bennett said of the fans. We want to take advantage of those opportunities. There could be a different dynamic in the crowd Tuesday night because many Dayton students stayed around for the Marquette game before departing at the end of the semester. The buzz might not be the same for UNLV's visit.UNLV (5-4) halted a three-game losing streak by defeating Pacific 72-65 on Saturday night. The Rebels have yet to claim a notable victory, falling to teams that have been ranked such as Memphis, Mississippi State and Creighton. We are playing teams that are going to compete for conference championships and play in the NCAA Tournament, UNLV coach Kevin Kruger said. We have to stick our chest out and know that we are going to put the work in to get that turned. UNLV's Julian Rishwain, a sixth-year player with his fourth school, is coming off a season-high 21 points with five 3-pointers against Pacific. Dedan Thomas Jr., who's scoring a team-leading 16.7 points per game, also came up with clutch baskets. DJ changed gears and ended up being the difference, Kruger said. He made some big-time shots and big-time plays. UNLV's only true road game so far resulted in an 83-65 setback at Creighton on Dec. 7.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/no-22-dayton-plays-way-into-rankings-turns-focus-to-unlv/
It's a personal-audio truism: Those who try AirPods love them at first listen and never look back. These durable wireless earbuds are comfortable, have a long battery life and produce fantastic sound — and they have an army of fans. Right now, you can get a stellar second-generation pair from Walmart for $40 off. Walmart Just double-tap these AirPods to skip a song, answer a call or activate Siri. Why is this a good deal? Just like it's true that AirPods are great, it's also true that good sales are rare. This price meets the bar, though — you aren't likely to see a better deal until a major sales event like Prime Day or Black Friday. You can also pick them up at Amazon for $99, where they have more than 535,000 reviews. Why do I need this? There's a reason AirPods always sell out: They're awesome. Sure, everyone might rave about AirPods Pro, but those cost a pretty penny. These second-generation AirPods provide comparable sound quality, are easy to use and just plain look great. What's more, their charging case slips easily into a pocket or purse (you might even forget it's in there). You can expect roughly five hours of battery life on a single charge, but the case can recharge your AirPods five times before it runs out of juice. That's nearly a full day of listening to your favorite tunes or podcasts, streaming content or listening to that hot new audiobook. Thanks to the Apple H1 chip, these pair easily with your iOS devices — just open the case and you'll be prompted to connect them. They're also durable. Remember how we said you might forget they're in your pocket? Well, we speak from experience — these AirPods survived a trip through the washing machine in a pants pocket without skipping a beat (so to speak). What reviewers say Fans of AirPods gush about them — over 34,000 Walmart shoppers have given these a nearly perfect review. These AirPods are just *kiss*! The sound quality is to die for and they go super loud so they can definitely tune someone out, said one fan. I love AirPods so much! They fit comfortably in my ears and the sound quality is so good. They can get lost easily and the sound can sometimes bleed out, but other than that I have absolutely no complaints, shared another shopper. A generous parent said, I bought these for my teenage daughter and she loves them! They came packaged nicely and pre-charged! They were easy to set up and are easy to use. She loves how easy it is to change songs and answer calls. The battery life is great, she uses them all the time and has never had an issue with them lasting all day on a charge. AirPods will keep you jamming out to your favorite tunes all day long. (Walmart) Walmart Forty bucks off a pair of these stellar buds? Music to our ears! Want to save even more?

Box trailer petition This new petition specifically relates to the 'box' trailers which have been regularly seen at both Ramsgate and Dover (Kent, England UK). Without adequate exterior identification that live animals are being carried, emergency rescue crews anywhere in the EU, called to an incident involving one of these specific trailers, could assume that other 'goods' are being transported rather than live animals, a situation which could subsequently result in animals being left locked in the trailer, where they could die due to lack of ventilation and / or being crushed due to lack of access by their rescuers who unaware that live beings are inside. This situation and the need for emergency crews to know that live animals are in transit has been verified in a written letter to the KAALE EU Correspondent from Mr. Van Goethem – Director of Veterinary and International Affairs at DG SANCO (Health and Consumers); the EU Commission responsible for animal welfare. ] petition pic The petition can be accessed via the following link: This petition is mainly aimed at EU residents as this is an EU wide situation.

P90384777 highRes quality check with a 730x487 at Latest Technologies in Car Manufacturing Back in the 80s and 90s as computerized robots were starting to take over the production lines in car factories, every one was sure that in future car manufacturing was in the mechanical hands of those machines. This has come true to a great extent, but robotics has not been the only technology that govern car manufacturing these days. That is supplemented by artificial intelligence and, something no one had anticipated before, virtual reality. Now what does a technology born in the world of video gaming have to do with producing cars, you may ask. VR is predominantly used these days in the development of cars, where designers and engineers need to have a better idea of what they are working on. That is why software developers have such a prominent role in today's automotive industry. They put together the virtual renderings of the products where physical mock-ups used to be the norm, and in this way save a lot of time and money in the production process. This technology also figures on the assembly line, where, through the use of augmented reality headsets, line workers will have an easier time matching an aligning everything and thus recuing error and improving efficiency. Engineers as well as welders from a welding school or welding services have also made a lot of headway in terms how cars are put together. From new materials to make the panels out of, to the way those panels are joined together, things have moved on pretty far compared to even ten years ago. Even in something like welding, which normally you think of as something mundane and basic, new tech has come up with some clever solutions to improve the build quality of car through how they are fixed together. Companies like Inoxform are constantly researching and developing new methods like MIG-MAG welding, stick joining, and TIG welding, the net result of which is safer and more durable vehicles. AI is another new trend in manufacturing that is getting more and more powerful these days, while comping with regulations like the ISO 13485 electronics manufacturer. From controlling the assembler robots, to handling the logistics and performing final quality checks, artificial intelligence and machine learning go a long way in speeding up the production and making cars produced today more reliable as well. A great example of this technology that has become rather prevalent can be seen in the logistics section with the STRs. The Smart Transport Robot developed in 2015, features flat, autonomous and mobile robots which can transport goods weighing up to one ton to their destination. They independently calculate the best route and move freely around the space using the SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) navigation method. The SLAM algorithm does not require permanent navigation transmitters to be installed in buildings and can therefore be set up quickly in a new environment without requiring any structural adjustments.|2025-03-16|https://www.motorward.com/2020/12/latest-technologies-in-car-manufacturing/

Pastor Jose Saez Jr. of the Iglesia Cristiana Alumbrando El Camino Church in Brentwood, New York. / YouTube/Iglesia Cristiana Alumbrando El Camino Twitter Pastor Jose Saez Jr. of the Iglesia Cristiana Alumbrando El Camino Church in Brentwood, New York. Editors' note: This article contains graphic descriptions of child sexual abuse. A Long Island pastor who told investigators that he couldn't stop himself from abusing children and has a penchant for preying on youth aged 11 and 15, pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation of a child in federal court in Central Islip Tuesday. He is expected to spend at least 15 years in prison. Pastor Jose Saez Jr., 29, of Iglesia Cristiana Alumbrando El Camino (Lighting The Way Christian Church) was arrested and charged with producing child pornography in 2023 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided his Brentwood home and recovered more than 20 videos of a 16-year-old boy that the pastor had shared with others. Get Our Latest News for FREE Subscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know. The defendant's sexual exploitation of minors, both in person and online, is horrific, and he now faces at least 15 years in prison for his unspeakable crimes, United States Attorney John J. Durham said in a release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. That he held a position of trust and responsibility as a pastor of a local church makes his conduct even more reprehensible. Protecting vulnerable children from predators like this defendant will always be a priority of this Office. According to court documents reviewed by The Christian Post, Saez allegedly told investigators that he was aware that the teenage boy, who he met on the messaging app called Telegram, was a high school student. Yet the married father of three children, who were aged 1, 3 and 5 at the time of his arrest, intentionally persuaded the minor to produce sexually explicit photographs and videos of himself and share them with him. In an October 2023 letter to U.S. Magistrate Judge Anne Y. Shields, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark E. Misorek argued that Saez was a danger to the community as he shared evidence of Saez admitting to preying on the children of his friends and family, and finding victims at church. He also shared how Saez groomed the 16-year-old boy, identified as John Doe. In August of 2023, the defendant engaged John Doe in a direct conversation on Telegram. The defendant groomed John Doe with flattery and gradually progressed to asking him for nude images of himself. John Doe repeatedly made references that he was 16 years old — a minor. Nonetheless, the defendant ultimately convinced John Doe to send a video of himself [performing sexually explicit acts], Misorek noted. The defendant encouraged John Doe, saying in sum and substance, 'Send me a picture of your face, tease me, let me see you in the mirror, need more pics, the front too, I want to see your body, take it out . . . your d---. That same month, Saez admitted to an undercover agent that he had sexually abused an infant and revealed how he targeted his younger victims at his church. In August of 2023, the defendant had online conversations with the UC. During those conversations, the defendant stated, among other things, that he had performed oral sex on an infant and ejaculated on the infant, that his 'sweet spot' for molesting children was children between the ages of 11 and 15 and that he was able to find his younger victims at 'church,' Misorek wrote. Investigators reviewed some 12,000 videos, 400,000 images and 6,800 chats recovered from devices owned by Saez. In one conversation, when asked if he was nervous about getting turned down by a minor, he replied, Getting turned down implies I'm giving them a choice[.] Though investigators did not recover any images of the pastor with infants, he stated in one chat, I f------ a few littles. During questioning with officers, Saez, who could be sentenced to a maximum of 30 years in prison for his crime, admitted that children are never safe with him Finally, during the course of the interview, while discussing creation, distribution and possession of child pornography, the defendant stated, 'I am sorry that I can't stop,' Misorek wrote.

The Canadian government is considering canceling its contract with U.S. defense contractor Lockheed Martin in light of the imposed tariffs by the Trump administration, the CBC reported. In June 2023, Canada signed a $19 billion contract to purchase 88 of the fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. But the Canadian government is looking for alternatives to their air defense in response to the ongoing tariff war and President Donald Trump's repeated remarks about making Canada the 51st U.S. state. Canada has already paid for 16 of the aircraft and is weary about supporting and maintaining a mixed fleet of fighter jets that would require their own unique training, hangers, infrastructure, and supply chain, all of which would increase cost. The first shipment of F-35s is scheduled to be delivered early in 2026. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

President Donald Trump announced that he's ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen in a post shared on his Truth Social account Saturday (March 15). Today, I have ordered the United States Military to launch decisive and powerful Military action against the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American, and other, ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote. The president then directly threatened the Houthi rebels, writing, YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! he added, while also warning Iran to cease its support of the group immediately. Trump also took aim at former President Joe Biden's past handling of the Houthi rebels following their attack on American warships in the Red Sea. Joe Biden's response was pathetically weak, so the unrestrained Houthis just kept going. It has been over a year since a U.S. flagged commercial ship safely sailed through the Suez Canal, the Red Sea, or the Gulf of Aden, he wrote. The last American Warship to go through the Red Sea, four months ago, was attacked by the Houthis over a dozen times. Funded by Iran, the Houthi thugs have fired missiles at U.S. aircraft, and targeted our Troops and Allies. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk.|2025-03-16|https://wgy.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-trump-orders-powerful-airstrike-attack/

Photo: HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY Steve Grace and Kirra Daley's Beachtree Distillery is among Australia's most awarded.

Subscribe now for unlimited access. or signup to continue reading All articles from our website The digital version of Today's Paper Breaking news alerts direct to your inbox All articles from the other in your area Standing proudly in Caloundra, on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, the organic distillery is now among Australia's most awarded. But the story of the First Nations-owned business begins well before the conversation that set the plans in motion. Ms Daley's father is a farmer, particularly interested in native plants, while her mother made sure to connect her to her Italian roots through winemaking and distilling. These traditions, combined with local, organic ingredients became a core passion. I was taught growing up that when you have a native it should be pure, you don't want to mix up chemicals or preservatives and things like that, the Bundjalung woman told AAP. Mr Grace's passion began with playing around with native ingredients out bush . With a background in engineering distilling equipment and using a process that is unique, the Kamilaroi man admits he's a perfectionist with each batch. I am very passionate about it, says the master distiller. The end result? It's me, it's mine and it represents me and us. I believe it has to be perfect. Beachtree brings together the pair's long-held passions for their traditions and love of ingredients from Australian soil. Even the name Beachtree is inspired by its location and the history that goes with it. The meaning of Caloundra in the local Kabi Kabi language is 'place of beech trees', so Beachtree is a nod to those roots. Each bottle adds to the distillery's story and pays homage to the past. I bring the influence of a 65,000 year heritage, Mr Grace said. Without the ancestors backing me, I wouldn't be able to do what I do. Master distiller Steve Grace is a self-described perfectionist. (HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY) Master distiller Steve Grace is a self-described perfectionist. (HANDOUT/BEACHTREE DISTILLERY) Over the years Ms Daley said she's learned to trust the master distiller's instincts. With a number of his handcrafted drops winning gold at the World Gin Awards, World Wine and Spirits competition and World Vodka Awards, Mr Grace has certainly earned this trust. Beachtree was also named craft producer of the year at the 2024 Icons of Gin Awards. But the journey hasn't always been easy for the small First Nations-owned business in a tough industry . The pair established Beachtree in 2020, with Ms Daley describing what came next as a rollercoaster , with COVID-19 lockdowns and 2022 floods disrupting the operation. They invested everything in the business, staying with family while the distillery found its feet. Sometimes I look back on those moments and think, 'what was I thinking', she said. But if we hadn't done it ... we'd probably be sitting there going 'what would have happened if we'd started that business we talked about over drinks'. The only way we're going to know how this pans out is if we just continue the journey and see where it takes us.|2025-03-16|https://www.merimbulanewsweekly.com.au/story/8917728/an-indigenous-owned-distillery-born-over-a-few-drinks/?cs=9676
I had originally planned this update for April, but I finished the update sooner than I expected. So, here we are with the last planned update for the Noob's GRID Graphics Mod! With the rework of Le Mans, this mod is finally complete. But the last planned update doesn't mean this mod is dead or abandoned. I just don't have anything to add anymore, since it does what a graphics mod should and then some. Now it's time for some emotional speech. When I first released this mod in 2022, it was honestly kinda random. At the September of Last year, I started working on it again after 2 years. And somehow this mod snowballed into a popularity that I didn't expected. So, thank you all for your support, I truly appreciated it! [Here is the new stuff with the 4.0 release]: -Reworked the Lighting of the Le Mans circuit -Small lighting rework to Jarama -All of the tracks are polished and fixed for one last time -New bonus content: Extra depth of field effects -New bonus content: Yokohama ProStreet Lighting [Reworked Le Mans] Le Mans was the final piece for the complete version of this mod. And it's here with a new glorious look! Here is the full day night cycle of Circuit de la Sarthe! Le Mans [Track Fixes] I learned how to mod the game's lighting as I go, you could say I was a noob (haha). So I left some small oversights here and there. Like incorrect smoke color (Thanks cyborg009). A consequence of this, I realised my old interpretation of the Jarama lighting was wrong because of incorrect sky brightness. Now it's more faithful to the original. Yokohamaf GRID13 [New Bonus Content] Going with the theme of copying other games's looks, I added Yokohama ProStreet Lighting . It creplicates the look of Tokyo Docks from Need for Speed ProStreet. Yokohama ProStreet But I think the main event is the Extra Depth of field effects . I toyed with the idea at my DIRT Graphics Mod, but scrapped it due being useless and horrible. I was going to scrap it for this mod too, but I found great uses for it! And from what I saw, this is the first time it's used like that in a mod, let's take a look!

Veolia and Southwark Council have secured new lithium-ion powered forklifts, a positive step towards achieving the goals laid out in Southwark Council's climate strategy to transform the area into a carbon neutral borough by 2030... Veolia Southwark has taken a significant step towards carbon-neutrality and enhanced operational efficiency by investing in four new state of the art lithium-ion battery powered forklifts. These forklifts are a key part of the recycling infrastructure, used to transport compacted bales of waste from the Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) floor into shipping containers to be transported and recycled. The new vehicles are fitted with a sophisticated sonar mechanism which calculates their reverse trajectory, scans surroundings, and automatically slows the vehicle when obstacles are detected, making them safer to operate than previous models. These forklifts support operational efficiency and sustainability, replacing previously trialled diesel and lead-acid battery models. The older models frequently faced challenges such as overheating, mechanical breakdowns and inflexible battery charging requirements, which made them ill-suited for the dynamic MRF environment. The new forklifts are powered by lithium-ion batteries, which have a comparatively longer lifespan of approximately eight to ten years. When these batteries reach the end of their optimal operational life, they will be repurposed for uses such as energy storage, before they are eventually processed securely at a dedicated battery recycling facility. Matthew Crane, Regional Manager at Veolia Southwark, said: Our investment in four lithium-ion clamp trucks marks a significant milestone in Veolia Southwark's journey towards ecological transformation. After years of trialling different solutions, we've found the perfect balance between sustainability and operational efficiency. These vehicles not only address the unique challenges of our MRF environment but also align with the carbon-neutrality goals we are working towards in partnership with Southwark Council.|2025-03-16|https://hub-4.com/news/veolia-southwark-electrifies-operations-with-new-zero-emission-forklifts
DePaul is improved after winning three games last season, and among the biggest indicators might be its performance behind the 3-point line.St. John's has struggled defending the 3-point line at times, but its offense is doing enough to get wins.Two teams with eight wins through the first 10 games meet Tuesday night in New York when DePaul visits St. John's.Under first-year coach Chris Holtmann, the Blue Demons (8-2, 0-1 Big East) are shooting 40.4 percent from behind the arc, 13th in Division I entering Monday. The roster contains seven rotation players shooting at least 35 percent.DePaul has made least nine 3s in each game to boast the Big East's third-best scoring offense (83.2 points) thanks to the trio of Jacob Meyer, Isaiah Rivera and David Skogman, who are each shooting at least 46 percent from deep.Rivera hit five 3s and Meyer added four Saturday when the Blue Demons set a school record for a regulation game by making 17 3s in a 91-72 win over Wichita State. CJ Gunn hit four triples and scored 22 points as DePaul rallied from a five-point halftime deficit. Skogman did not score Saturday but sank six 3s and scored 22 points in last week's loss against Providence. I've learned that it doesn't really matter who's playing, DePaul's N.J. Benson said.

The Atlanta Braves are approaching the end of Spring Training, but there are several concerns as they approach Opening Day. While the Braves got good news on Spencer Strider and Ronald Acuña Jr., the bad news came when Jurickson Profar jammed his wrist and Sean Murphy landed on the shelf with a cracked left rib. The latest scare came when third baseman Austin Riley was hit in the hand with a Jackson Rutledge fastball during a 5-3 loss to the Washington Nationals on Friday. But the injury wasn't as bad as initially feared, giving the Braves some much-needed good news late Friday night. Austin Riley Has No Structural Damage After Injury Scare MLB.com's Mark Bowman reports that a CT scan revealed no structural damage on Riley's right hand. The 27-year-old also underwent X-rays after being removed from Friday's game, but Braves manager Brian Snitker believed that Riley should be able to resume playing within the next few days. Riley's diagnosis comes as a relief, considering Riley missed the final six weeks of the 2024 season with a fractured right hand. After being hit in the same area, it raised the concern of Snitker, who was also relieved to see his All-Star third baseman was alright. You get scared anytime somebody's hit in a hand or anything like that, Snitker said. There are so many small bones in there. We saw last year what can happen. I'm glad it turned out well. The Braves will hope that Riley will shake off his injury scare to shake off a tough 2024 season. Riley entered the year with back-to-back All-Star appearances, hitting .277/.347/.522 with 75 home runs and 190 RBI between the 2022 and 2023 seasons. But his performance at the plate dropped off, hitting .256/.322/.461 with 19 homers and 56 RBI in 110 games before his injury in August. Riley should also join Profar in the Opening Day lineup as the Braves head west to open the season against the San Diego Padres on March 27.

What makes a good salesperson? Salespeople serve as the vanguard of a company's success. They transform strategies into tangible results, breathe life into products and services, and ultimately create valuable connections that drive revenue. Whether you're about to hire your first sales rep or just looking to improve an existing team, business owners need to understand what qualities to look for and nurture. This article looks at the DNA of successful salespeople, explores key sales skills and mastery of the sales process, and debunks the myth of the natural-born salesperson. First up are qualities that make a great salesman, followed by ways they excel at each stage. Table of ContentsToggle Key Qualities of a Great Salesperson A good salesperson embodies qualities that distinguish them from others, including exceptional communication skills, resilience, empathy, and an unwavering commitment to customer service. These traits lay the foundation for sales success. Let's start with communication skills. The Most Successful Salespeople Have Strong Communication Skills Successful sales is about effective communication. Articulate the value of your product clearly, simplify complex information, and adeptly handle inquiries. Clear communication fosters trust with potential customers, enhances confidence, and lays the groundwork for successful transactions and lasting business relationships. Top Salespeople Practice Active Listening Active listening in sales goes beyond hearing words—it's about truly understanding customer needs. A good salesperson listens to spoken words and understands the unspoken. Tailor your sales pitch to your customer's needs and offer personalized solutions. This focus on the client ensures successful sales and fosters enduring relationships. Adaptability and Resilience in Sales Success In the dynamic world of sales, adaptability and resilience are invaluable. Sales professionals face diverse clients, fluctuating market trends, and potential rejections. Those who adapt their strategies to suit changing circumstances and bounce back from setbacks swiftly, sustain their performance. The Best Salespeople Have Empathy and Emotional Intelligence Empathy is about understanding and sharing customers' feelings and perspectives. Emotional intelligence complements empathy, enabling salespeople to manage their emotions and respond empathetically to clients. This winning combination builds trust, fosters strong relationships, and drives successful sales outcomes. A Successful Salesperson is Goal-Oriented and Self-Motivated Being a successful salesperson extends beyond product knowledge or an affable demeanor; it's deeply anchored in a fervent commitment to goals and an innate drive to achieve. It's about setting crystal-clear objectives, delineating them into tangible, actionable steps, and maintaining strict accountability to oneself. This discipline is bolstered by an internal reservoir of motivation. A self-driven salesperson doesn't just meet targets; they aim to consistently outdo themselves. Their proactive mindset prepares them to swiftly pivot in the face of challenges, viewing them less as obstacles and more as avenues for further growth. Mastering the Sales Process: How Good Sales Professionals Excel at Each Stage The sales process involves prospecting, qualifying leads, making a compelling pitch, handling objections, closing the deal, and providing exceptional post-sales support. Mastering these steps will increase your chances of success and delivery of outstanding customer experiences. Prospecting and Lead Generation Identifying potential customers and generating leads is your crucial first step. Actively seeking out potential customers allows you to expand your customer base and create opportunities for sales. By targeting the right audience, following the commandments of business networking, and initiating meaningful interactions, you lay a solid foundation for successful sales conversions. Qualifying Leads and Needs Assessment Good salespeople employ a combination of effective questioning and active listening to uncover the specific needs of their potential customers. Consequently, they skillfully guide the conversation, clearly showing how their solution aligns with the customer's unique requirements. Good salespeople excel in the process of qualifying leads and assessing needs by: Effective Questioning: Using probing and targeted questions to delve deeper into the client's needs and challenges. Active Listening: Paying attention not just to the spoken words but also to underlying concerns or desires. Guiding the Conversation: Steering discussions in a direction that uncovers genuine customer needs. Solution Alignment: Demonstrating how their product or service precisely meets the identified requirements of the customer. Presentation and Handling Objections Success lies in showcasing product benefits, not just features. For instance, a skilled sales professional might highlight how their software saves time and reduces errors. A great salesperson proactively addresses potential concerns and offers clear answers. A realtor might alleviate concerns about a property's age by emphasizing its maintenance and customization potential. Handling objections is a crucial sales skill that involves acknowledging the potential customer's concerns and then strategically navigating around them. A car salesman might address price objections by focusing on the vehicle's fuel efficiency and low maintenance. Closing the Deal and Follow-Up Closing a deal often requires timing, finesse, and a deep understanding of customer needs. Good salespeople can read cues and know when to make their moves. For instance, they may offer a limited-time discount to create urgency. They also prioritize after-sales service. They keep in touch, ensuring customer satisfaction and addressing any further queries. For example, a furniture salesperson might follow up to ensure a customer's new sofa meets their expectations and offer assistance if needed. What Makes a Good Salesperson Summary Sales Skills & Qualities Characteristics of Top Salespeople Potential Contrast (If Applicable) Active Listening Truly understands customer needs, not just hearing words. Focuses on spoken and unspoken cues. May only focus on words, missing out on underlying needs or concerns. Adaptability and Resilience Adapts strategies to changing circumstances, swiftly bounces back from setbacks. Struggles with change and is easily discouraged by challenges. Empathy & Emotional Intelligence Understands and shares customers' feelings, manages own emotions, responds empathetically. Builds trust. May lack understanding or misread customers' emotions, hindering relationship-building. Goal-Oriented & Self-Motivation Sets clear goals, breaks them into actionable steps. Driven by internal motivation and proactive approach. Might lack clear objectives or the intrinsic drive to meet them. Mastering the Sales Process Excels in prospecting, qualifying leads, pitching, handling objections, closing deals, and post-sales support. May have weaknesses in certain stages or lack a comprehensive approach to the sales process. Prospecting & Lead Generation Actively seeks potential customers, expands customer base, targets the right audience with meaningful interactions. Might wait for leads to come to them or engage in generic, non-targeted outreach. Qualifying Leads & Needs Assessment Uses effective questioning and active listening to align solutions with the customer's unique requirements. May rush to pitch products without fully understanding the customer's needs. Presentation & Handling Objections Showcases product benefits, not just features. Addresses concerns, offers clear answers. Focuses on value, such as time-saving or low maintenance. Might dwell on product features without linking to tangible benefits or struggles to counter objections. Closing the Deal & Follow-Up Reads customer cues, knows when to make closing moves, prioritizes after-sales service, ensures customer satisfaction. Might miss closing opportunities or neglect customers after a sale, risking dissatisfaction. The Importance of Good Salespeople Sales professionals are the lifeblood of any successful business. Their work directly impacts a company's bottom line, shaping its growth trajectory and market standing. Beyond promoting a product or service, they build and maintain relationships, turning prospects into loyal customers. They also offer valuable insights into customer needs and preferences, informing future business strategies and product development. Creating a whole team with these qualities can help you foster healthy competition at work and motivate employees to go above and beyond. Growing Business Revenue A skilled sales professional becomes a revenue driver, expertly closing deals and generating fresh leads. Their deep product knowledge and keen understanding of customer needs translate into persuasive pitches. This, coupled with their persistent follow-ups, wins immediate business and cultivates long-term relationships, leading to repeat sales and referrals, thereby significantly boosting a company's revenue. Building Customer Relationships Successful salespeople excel at nurturing relationships, ensuring customer satisfaction post-purchase. By understanding clients' unique needs, offering personalized solutions, and maintaining consistent, transparent communication, they foster trust and loyalty. This dedication converts one-time customers into repeat clients and turns them into enthusiastic brand ambassadors, further enhancing the business's reach. Debunking the Myth of the Natural-Born Salesperson The concept of a natural-born salesperson often overshadows the truth that skills in sales can be cultivated. Rather than innate talent, success in sales is largely a product of hard work, learning, and adaptability. For instance, a once introverted individual might become an effective salesperson through training and practical experience. Key Takeaways and Additional Insights: Cultivating Skills Over Relying on Innate Talent: Success in sales is not just about having a natural knack for it. It's more about putting in the effort to learn effective sales strategies, understanding customer psychology, and constantly refining communication skills. Importance of Training and Experience: Even those who might initially be introverted or not confident in their selling abilities can evolve into excellent salespeople. This transformation is possible through structured training, mentorship, and hands-on experience. Adaptability is Key: The dynamic nature of sales requires adaptability. A willingness to embrace new techniques, adapt to changing market trends, and understand diverse customer needs is essential.

COULEE DAM, Wash. - Trump administration workforce cuts at federal agencies overseeing U.S. dams are threatening their ability to provide reliable electricity, supply farmers with water and protect communities from floods, employees and industry experts warn. The Bureau of Reclamation provides water and hydropower to the public in 17 western states. Nearly 400 agency workers have been cut through the Trump reduction plan, an administration official said. Reductions-in-force memos have also been sent to current workers, and more layoffs are expected. The cuts included workers at the Grand Coulee Dam, the largest hydropower generator in North America, according to two fired staffers interviewed by The Associated Press. Expand Former Grand Coulee Dam worker, Stephanie Duclos, sits in front of the Grand Coulee Dam on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025 in Coulee Dam, Wash., explaining how she was terminated from her job under the Trump administration's federal workforce reduction plan. ( Without these dam operators, engineers, hydrologists, geologists, researchers, emergency managers and other experts, there is a serious potential for heightened risk to public safety and economic or environmental damage, Lori Spragens, executive director of the Kentucky-based Association of Dam Safety Officials, told the AP. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said federal workforce reductions will ensure disaster responses are not bogged down by bureaucracy and bloat. A more efficient workforce means more timely access to resources for all Americans, she said by email. But a bureau hydrologist said they need people on the job to ensure the dams are working properly. These are complex systems, said the worker in the Midwest, who is still employed but spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of possible retaliation. Workers keep dams safe by monitoring data, identifying weaknesses and doing site exams to check for cracks and seepage. Expand Banks Lake on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, is a 27-mile-long reservoir created by water pump from the Grand Coulee Dam, run by the Department of Reclamation. (AP Photos/Martha Bellisle) As we scramble to get these screenings, as we lose institutional knowledge from people leaving or early retirement, we limit our ability to ensure public safety, the worker added. Having people available to respond to operational emergencies is critical. Cuts in staff threaten our ability to do this effectively. A federal judge on Thursday ordered the administration to rehire fired probationary workers, but a Trump spokesperson said they would fight back, leaving unclear whether any would return. The heads of 14 California water and power agencies sent a letter to the Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Interior last month warning that eliminating workers with specialized knowledge in operating and maintaining aging infrastructure could negatively impact our water delivery system and threaten public health and safety. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers also operates dams nationwide. Matt Rabe, a spokesman, declined to say how many workers left through early buyouts, but said the agency hasn't been told to reduce its workforce. But Neil Maunu, executive director of the Pacific Northwest Waterways Association, said it learned more than 150 Army Corps workers in Portland, Oregon, were told they would be terminated and they expect to lose about 600 more in the Pacific Northwest. The firings include district chiefs down to operators on vessels and people critical to safe river navigation, he said. Their last day is not known. The Corps was told to provide a plan to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management by March 14, Maunu said. Several other federal agencies that help ensure dams run safely also have faced layoffs and closures. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is laying off 10% of its workforce and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Dam Safety Review Board was disbanded in January. The cuts come at a time when the nation's dams need expert attention. Expand Former Grand Coulee Dam worker, Stephanie Duclos, sits at a picnic table in front of Banks Lake in Electric City, Wash., holding a letter from the Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation on Friday, Feb. 28, 2025, saying she has been terminated An AP review of Army Corps data last year showed at least 4,000 dams are in poor or unsatisfactory condition and could kill people or harm the environment if they failed. They require inspections, maintenance and emergency repairs to avoid catastrophes, the AP found. Heavy rain damaged the spillway at California's Oroville Dam in 2017, forcing nearly 190,000 residents to evacuate, and Michigan's Edenville Dam breached in storms in 2020, the AP found. Stephanie Duclos, a Bureau of Reclamation probationary worker fired at the Grand Coulee Dam, said she was among a dozen workers initially terminated. The dam across the Columbia River in central Washington state generates electricity for millions of homes and supplies water to a 27-mile-long (43-kilometer) reservoir that irrigates the Columbia Basin Project. This is a big infrastructure, she said. It's going to take a lot of people to run it. Some fired employees had worked there for decades but were in a probation status due to a position switch. Duclos was an assistant for program managers who organized training and was a liaison with human resources. The only person doing that job, she fears how others will cover the work. You're going to get employee burnout in the workers left behind, she said. Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who pushed a bipartisan effort to ensure the National Dam Safety Program was authorized through 2028, said, the safety and efficacy of our dams is a national security priority. Americans deserve better, and I will work to make sure this administration is held accountable for their reckless actions, Padilla said.|2025-03-16|https://www.fox13seattle.com/news/dam-workers-trump-federal-cuts

BUFFALO, N.Y. — A man who inadvertently traveled to the Peace Bridge with a revolver and five rounds of ammunition is facing charges. The 34-year-old man was driving a commercial truck and working as a local delivery driver when he inadvertently arrived at the Peace Bridge on March 11, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in a statement. RELATED: Military deserter arrested on the Rainbow Bridge pedestrian walkway The man was denied entry into Canada and returned to the United States, at which time told officers he possessed a firearm and was taken aside for a secondary examination. That's when officers said they found an Amadeo Rossi .38 caliber pistol and five rounds of ammunition. It was determined that the man, who currently resides in the state of Florida, unlawfully possessed the firearm due to a prior felony conviction prohibiting possession of firearms, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said.

The Pacific Northwest has fantastic fish & chip options. How do our regions' best seafood restaurants compare to other significant and traditional fish & chip locations of New England, the eastern seaboard, and California? Fish and Chips is known as the national dish of the United Kingdom. Its popularity in England was first documented in the 1860s. Fish & chips were served in the 1600s at Buckingham Palace as the regular Friday dinner for Queen Elizabeth II. Fish and chip locations in London, known as chippers, have long been the gold standard. While I've never been to London to try British fish & chips, I have tried several places in Washington and listed my five favorite fish & Chip restaurants in our state.

We seldom come across a place that has acted as the capital of not one, not two, but three crucial territories simultaneously. Yet, there was a time when the Himalayan hill station of 'Simla' (now Shimla) served as the political centre of imperial India, colonial Punjab, as well as colonial Burma. While Simla's relationship with the first and second is fairly well known, its affinity with the third is largely forgotten. Even though it was in the 1940s that the hill capital directly came to 'host' Burma, the link goes back to the 19th century, when the British Empire and Burma's Konbaung dynasty collided thrice during British India's longest and most expensive war. Numerous negotiations of the third and final war (1885-87) were done in Simla. This was also a time when the imperial authorities gained access to the famous 'Burma teak', and exploited the invaluable material to embellish several Simla buildings, most famously the Viceregal Lodge (now the Indian Institute of Advanced Study), as well as for carving out the Speaker's chair at the erstwhile Council Chamber, now Himachal Pradesh's Vidhan Sabha. It was, however, the notion of 'exile' that peculiarly yoked the two places together during the thick of the Second World War. Quite tellingly, political exile already had precedents in the larger landscape of colonialism. Not only was the last Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar sent to Burma's Rangoon in 1858, the last king of Burma, Thibaw Min, was also expelled to the Indian port city of Ratnagiri in 1885. And with the 1942 Japanese invasion of colonial Burma, its government was exiled to Simla, from where it operated for three years until 1945. Advertisement Shifting from the Far East to the Himalayan heights brought its own set of issues, as the government-in-exile suffered humiliation and disdain in Simla. The historians Christopher Bayly and Tim Harper capture the scenario by remarking that into this precipitous ant hill ventured, like unloved poor relations, what remained of the government of Burma . And at the centre of this political storm was the Governor, the Anglo-Irish diplomat Reginald Dorman Smith, who was joined by Burmese officials such as Tin Tut, Thein Pe and Sir Paw Tun, all with varying degrees of allegiances and support for the ruling British. A few years ago, at London's British Library, I chanced upon a rare set of exchanges between the exiled government and the Burma Office at London, where the former requests the latter for supplying it with adequate infrastructure in Simla, including well-furnished houses . Most amusing was the response to Dorman Smith's plea for using a motor car in the town, that smacked of the exclusivity preserved for the hill capital's established customs. It read: The question of motor car is a delicate one, since it is difficult to say why one would be necessary. The Viceroy, Commander-in-Chief and the Governor of Punjab are the only people permitted to use a motor car in Simla and I would have thought the Governor of Burma could well travel by rickshaw like everyone else. In a subsequent response, the case is outrightly dismissed with the admonition: I see no reason why the Governor should have a motor car at Simla. Advertisement Even as the Empire's hold weakened with the raging war and the escalating spirit of nationalism, Dorman Smith instituted a kind of academic seminar in Simla for the three years of exile to reappraise the whole history of the British rule in the country. In 1944, he even organised the 'Simla Conference' with Anglo-Burmese leaders to discuss the colony's politics (this was a year before the well-known 1945 'Simla Conference' between Lord Wavell and Indian leaders). In lighter moments, the Governor and his wife would find comfort in their pet dogs, while someone like Thein Pe — the leading spokesman of the leftist movement in Burma — spent much of his time sleeping and watching films in the warm cinemas of Simla. One could find several other personnel linked both to Simla and Burma's soil. From the last Indian Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, who oversaw the recapture of Burma from the Japanese in 1945, to Spencer Harcourt Butler, who served as Burma's Governor from 1923-27 and after whom was named a famous school in Simla, the list is rich with details. Even after Independence, the link was revived in the form of Aung San Suu Kyi's fellowship at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study in 1986. As the daughter of Aung San, the Father of Modern Burma (now Myanmar), Suu Kyi researched Burmese literature and culture, and would later label her Simla days as her best ones ever. It is, however, in the very 'Indian' personalities of the late doctor-couple, Dr BR Nanda and Dr L Nanda, that I found the surprising coda to Simla's Burma chapter. Married in 1943, these Simla-based personalities were the most sought-after medical practitioners of their time, and served as the official doctors to the exiled Burmese Government, while also acting as doctors for local rajas, schools and common citizens. Both shared the same clinic and even the same table, with Mrs Nanda donning the significant role of the Chief Medical Recruiting Officer for the Burmese Government. I came to learn about this remarkable duo from their son, the 81-year-old JR Nanda. Often spotted in a Pahari cap and shawl, the junior 'Nandaji' preserves his parents' memories in as fine a manner as he conserves his 1896 colonial-era home 'Hawkesford', which his parents purchased in 1950. Nandaji rightly feels proud about the fact that his mother was the first female doctor to be allowed private practice by the British in the region, while his father, along with being a physician, was also reputed as Simla's 'walking encyclopaedia'— a tag that the son carries further. Sitting in his cedar-furnished, double-storeyed home whose design was inspired by the wingspan of a hawk, Nandaji has often indulged me with his family's private papers and photographs. And it was in these records that I came across his father's handwritten impressions of Simla during the Second World War, that almost entirely deal with the Burmese government-in-exile, and reveal the Senior Nanda's associations with Dorman Smith and Tin Tut (the Chief Secretary and Adviser to the Governor). The doctor highlights that the Burmese offices ran from different buildings under the imperial government. He was amazed by a group of Anglo-Burmese ladies whose attire I had never seen before . The Junior Mr Nanda recalls one such lady as well, a certain Miss Fook Chong, who didn't wish to return to Burma and started a Grammar School on the Ridge, where he studied as a child from 1947-48. When Burma was recaptured by the British and it was time to leave, Tin Tut requested Dr BR Nanda to accompany him to the colony — a proposal he politely declined. Along with his wife, Dr Nanda continued to serve the people of Shimla and Himachal for over half a century. Both of them passed away in the late 1990s, but their humble table from their clinic in Lower Bazar still stands regally under a high Victorian arch at Hawkesford. A garlanded photograph of the aged couple hangs just above, with a paperweight, inkstand and a letterhead sitting below. On the right is a wall clock which, according to Nandaji, stopped working at exactly the moment his father passed away, three years after his life partner, bringing to a conclusion an era of ministrations never to return, from Simla's Burma to Shimla. — The writer is a historian, artist and cultural critic from Shimla|2025-03-16|https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/in-depth/shimlas-burma-chapter/

For investors who have ability & funds to turn correction into opportunity: 5 large-caps with an upside potential of up to 49% Synopsis Understand one thing clearly. A rise in a company's stock price does not mean the business is strong. And a fall in stock price does not mean the business is weak. The ability to make a distinction between the stock price and the business and its growth path when everyone is bearish is what is needed to make that extra return from the stock market. On our list today are companies where the business is fine. It is just that the narrative has turned bad, and that too not on the business but on the stock price front. Remember: Stock prices are controlled by liquidity and business is governed by the economy. Read our headline carefully. It uses the word ability first and then funds . Not the other way round. The reason: At this point of time, more than anything else, what an investor requires is ability. The ability to survive the bear phase, which is only possible if you have the ability to ignore the narratives on the street.

Anthony Elanga brace helps Forest see off Ipswich and boost Champions League bid By George Sessions, PA A brace by Anthony Elanga helped Nottingham Forest to a comfortable 4-2 win at Ipswich to open up a six-point gap to Manchester City in the battle for Champions League qualification. Forest had boosted their unexpected top-four charge with a late victory over City last Saturday and followed it up with a comprehensive display at Portman Road where three goals in six first-half minutes settled the contest. After Nikola Milenkovic broke the deadlock in the 35th minute, Elanga twice punished slack Town defending to take his goal tally for the season to five. Substitute Jota Silva added a fourth for Forest late on and while Jens Cajuste and George Hirst grabbed consolations, 18th-placed Ipswich are now nine points from safety after relegation rivals Wolves won at Southampton on a damaging day for the Suffolk club. Forest arrived at Portman Road eager to clinch a third victory this season over Town after a recent FA Cup success, but Omari Hutchinson provided early urgency for the hosts with a wasted free-kick opportunity followed by a curled effort over. Julio Enciso also had a shot deflected off target, but the visitors slowly started to create openings. A poor pass by Leif Davis gifted an opportunity to Elliot Anderson, who fired wide via the back of team-mate Chris Wood before a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross almost crept in. Nottingham Forest's Jota Silva scores his side's fourth / Jota Silva fires home Forest's fourth goal (John Walton/PA) Photo by John Walton Lapses of concentration had proved costly time and time again for Ipswich this campaign and another produced the opener for Forest after 35 minutes. A corner was given away cheaply after Alex Palmer's clearance hit Cajuste and while Town dealt with the initial delivery, Liam Delap failed to adequately clear Nicolas Dominguez's knock-down from a Hudson-Odoi cross and Milenkovic fired home. It sparked an Ipswich collapse as within two minutes it was 2-0 and a third for Forest followed before half-time as Elanga helped himself to a brace. Firstly, Anderson won back possession and released Swedish attacker Elanga, who raced away down the right before he cut inside Jacob Greaves and curled into the bottom corner. It was another poor goal from an Ipswich point of view, but worse was to follow as a simple Milenkovic ball over the top evaded the home defence and Elanga sped away before firing past Palmer in the 41st minute. Boos greeted the half-time whistle but home boss Kieran McKenna reacted with Greaves withdrawn and Ipswich tried to respond. A dangerous corner by Davis had to be clawed away by Forest goalkeeper Matz Sels before an unmarked Delap headed wide from another set-piece. Town further built a head of steam with Davis firing wide before Delap had a lobbed effort cleared off the line by Milenkovic. Forest remained a threat on the counter-attack, with Neco Williams and Morgan Gibbs-White wasteful and Cajuste produced an 82nd-minute consolation when he curled home from 20 yards. It sparked a flurry of late goals as a slick breakaway allowed Gibbs-White to tee up substitute Silva to make it 4-1 before Hirst headed home from Dara O'Shea cross in stoppage time for Ipswich.|2025-03-16|https://www.anglocelt.ie/2025/03/15/anthony-elanga-brace-helps-forest-see-off-ipswich-and-boost-champions-league-bid/
Liam Gallagher could reportedly 'face £86,000 a year a**hole tax' after calling the mother of his love child a 'gold digger.' Liza Ghorbani, 51, who shares 12-year-old daughter Gemma with the Oasis star, 52, is said to have 'filed a fresh child support claim' - which Liam hit back at in a series of posts to X. His comments could result in the judge increasing his total annual amount to £386,000. US lawyer James Sexton told The Sun: 'There's always the possibility that the judge assigned to the case might impose what we jokingly call the 'a**hole tax'. 'They could take those comments on social media as a sign that he's boorish or unpleasant and hit him on the high end of the permissible child support numbers.' Last week, Liam appeared to label Liza a 'gold digger' after she reportedly filed for an increase in child support payments ahead of the Oasis reunion tour. Liam Gallagher could reportedly 'face £86,000 a year a**hole tax' after calling the mother of his love child a 'gold digger' (pictured in March 2024) / Liza Ghorbani, 51, who shares 12-year-old daughter Gemma with the Oasis star, 52, is asking for a 'silly amount,' taking advantage of Liam's upcoming payday from the Oasis reunion, which is expected to net the singer a cool £50million. An insider told The Sun: 'It's clear that Liza and her legal team are hoping to cash in on Liam's big tour earnings. 'He's always been generous with his child maintenance, but now she's asking for even more money. It's causing Liam unnecessary stress as he prepares for the tour.' The new claim, filed in the New York Supreme Court, comes after a confidential settlement was reached back in 2015.

However, Liam's personal life is once again being thrust into the spotlight as he battles the demands of his former fling. A source said: 'It's added pressure on Liam, who's never even met Gemma. This latest case is just one of the many issues he's had to deal with when it comes to his personal life.' The trouble began when Liam, who had a brief affair with Ghorbani in 2010, was forced to confront the paternity of Gemma after she filed a £2million lawsuit for child support in 2013. Liam was fined for missing court hearings and publicly admitted that he hadn't met his daughter, although he offered to help her if needed. The former Oasis frontman has had a tumultuous love life, with children from several relationships. He shares daughter Molly, 26, with singer Lisa Moorish and son Lennon, 25, with ex-wife Patsy Kensit. He also has son Gene, 23, with ex-wife Nicole Appleton. Liam is now engaged to his co-manager, Debbie Gwyther, 40, and appears to be enjoying a more settled relationship.

In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The announcement from the White House came just hours after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against the removal of five Venezuelan men for 14 days under the expected invocation of the act. An emergency hearing on the matter will take place Saturday evening. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do.

Once upon a time, people who wanted to steer clear of politically divisive conversations knew they could stick to a safe topic: the weather. No such luck anymore, now that the Trump administration's whirlwind dismantling of government is coming for the agencies dedicated to predicting what's coming, preventing underlying conditions from getting even worse and helping rebuild after increasingly frequent disaster strikes. And bad timing too, just as those of us in the states that surround the Gulf of Mexico, all of which voted for Donald Trump, are looking ahead to the next hurricane season. It's hard to keep up with the haphazard, on-and-off decisions out of Washington these days — that's what happens when an administration floods the zone with so much news that it's difficult to concentrate on any one story — but here's a sampling of what is either already here or possibly on the horizon. Through attrition and mass layoffs, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service, could lose nearly 20% of its 13,000-member workforce to the administration's DOGE-driven downsizing — some of which is held up in court and some since chaotically rescinded. These are people who produce weather forecasts, maintain radar systems, gather data from satellites and even fly into hurricanes to monitor deadly threats. Their work is used by the private websites and TV meteorologists that the public relies upon to understand risk. And if you don't believe me, maybe you'll trust Margaret Orr, whose forecasts New Orleans viewers relied upon for decades before she retired from WDSU last year. I can testify to the fact that the National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service, both part of National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, give lifesaving information, Orr wrote in these pages. And why is this happening? Well, maybe it goes back to the claim in Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint that Trump disavowed on the campaign trail but is largely following in office, that NOAA is one of the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry. Or maybe, just maybe, climate change alarmism actually comes from the alarming things Americans are experiencing in real life, from monster storms that intensify overnight as they pass over ever-hotter water the Gulf to sky-high insurance rates from those few companies still willing to write policies in the hurricane zone. Action to stem climate change, of course, is another administration target. Here's how The New York Times recently summarized where the Environmental Protection Agency is on that: The Trump administration said it would repeal dozens of the nation's most significant environmental regulations, including limits on pollution from tailpipes and smokestacks, protections for wetlands, and the legal basis that allows it to regulate the greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. That means greenhouse gases creating more extreme weather, no matter how diminished the NOAA is. And it means more disasters, but big cutbacks may be coming for how we handle those, too. Trump has talked of reimagining or even eliminating FEMA and sending its responsibilities to the states. Yes, disaster response could be streamlined, as Louisianans know. But the reason they know that is because Louisianans are among the biggest recipients of federal money after hurricanes and other storms hit. According to an Axios story on based on data from the Carnegie Disaster Dollar Database, Louisiana's average annual take between 2015 to 2024 from FEMA and HUD recovery grants totaled $1.4 billion, tied with Texas and behind only Florida. Louisiana led — by far — in FEMA and HUD recovery grant funding as a share of 2023 state spending, at 6.3%, well ahead of Florida with 2.8%. Another data point from the organization listed three Louisiana congressional districts among the top eight in FEMA household aid applications since 2021, with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise's 1st district ranking second nationally. So maybe he and Louisiana's other top congressional leader, House Speaker Mike Johnson, might want to speak up about all this, rather than acting as an extension of the Trump administration. Sure as June follows March, April and May, hurricane season is coming for the people they represent. Politics aside, surely they don't want this perfect storm to unfold on their watch, do they?|2025-03-16|https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/opinion/hurricane-scalise-johnson-trump-fema-noaa/article_e71b782c-3f16-56bc-8039-fedcfb5b7afd.html
Since its establishment, the Israeli offensive cyber firm Paragon has operated under a central guiding principle: not to be like NSO Group's logo NSO / NSO Group's logo (Illustration: Shutterstock) (Illustration: Shutterstock) Since its inception, Paragon has positioned itself as NSO's opposite. It claims to sell its spyware, called Graphite, exclusively to democratic governments with security service oversight, with the condition that it be used only against criminals and terrorists. While NSO Group's logo (Illustration: Shutterstock) / View gallery / NSO Group's logo NSO / NSO Group's logo (Illustration: Shutterstock) / View gallery Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Ehud Schneerson (Photo: PR) (Photo: PR) Last month, 90 people across 20 countries received a mysterious message from WhatsApp's support saying that WhatsApp was able to identify and block spyware that targeted their phones and recommending they contact Citizen Lab for assistance. Citizen Lab is a Canadian organization specializing in detecting digital espionage that has previously been involved in investigating NSO Group's embarrassing affairs. Three victims of the spyware were quickly identified, causing significant embarrassment for the Italian government, which has been accused of orchestrating the surveillance - an allegation it has so far denied. The individuals targeted include journalist Francesco Cancellato, the head of the migrant rescue group Luca Casarini, and social activist Husam El Gomati, figures whom a democratic state would not typically be expected to spy on. Since then, Italy has been in turmoil over the affair, which reminds the NSO scandal that nearly led to the establishment of a state commission of inquiry in Israel. And it's not just in Italy, concern is mounting across Europe. This week, both the Italian Parliament and the European Parliament in Strasbourg held discussions on the matter. Victims of the alleged espionage have filed police complaints, opposition parties are demanding an investigation, and Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government denies any involvement. However, even her supporters remain skeptical. Get the Ynetnews app on your smartphone: Google Play: https://bit.ly/4eJ37pE Apple App Store: https://bit.ly/3ZL7iNv The similarity to the NSO scandal is striking. In both cases, citizens were shocked to discover that spyware had targeted their cellphones. In both cases, the entities responsible for deploying the surveillance tools remain in the shadows, leaving politicians to scramble for explanations and the media to deliver harsh criticism. NSO sold its spyware indiscriminately, from paranoid autocrats in unstable regimes to African dictators. Its technology has been linked – not always justifiably - to espionage and suppression of journalists, human rights activists and dissidents; and even assassinations allegedly carried out with its tools. The company's actions gave offensive cyber technology such a bad name that the U.S. government ultimately blacklisted it.

I know why my name was published – I'm known as a reporting journalist. Even if the report is about me, I can't just keep it to myself. I don't know why others weren't identified. Maybe they're afraid, or maybe their cases are still being investigated. Did you notice anything unusual with your cellphone before the discovery? Was there a sign of someone spying on you? Now that I think about it, in recent months, my WhatsApp crashed for no apparent reason. At first, I thought it was my fault, because I'm really bad with smartphones, so I didn't give it much thought. I never suspected those crashes were connected to spyware. Even now, I'm not sure if there's a connection. Are you concerned about the files and data taken from your device? Was there anything of great importance? As the editor of an investigative news site, I see this as an intrusion into my newsroom, not just my cellphone, and that worries me. I was told this spyware isn't like Pegasus [the Israeli spyware by NSO, which records and captures what the target does], but they could have taken any data they wanted from my device. Do you have any idea why you were targeted? I don't know who spied on me or why. But I doubt they were interested in where I vacation or who I have dinner with. They probably wanted to know about my work, about our investigations. That's the only thing I'm sure of. ראש ממשלת איטליה ג'ורג'ה מלוני / Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni (Photo: Filippo Monteforte/AFP) / View gallery ראש ממשלת איטליה ג'ורג'ה מלוני / Italian Prime Minister Georgia Meloni (Photo: Filippo Monteforte/AFP) (Photo: Filippo Monteforte/AFP) Could your exposé on Meloni's party be the reason? Indeed, we conducted investigative reports on Meloni's party, and they received wide coverage. It was a scandal because it is a pro-Israel party, and we exposed young fascists within it who were singing and joking about antisemitism. That investigation had a major impact on the government, so maybe there's a connection. You may have angered someone in the government or the police. I don't know, that's speculation. But I want to know that I live in a democracy where no one spies on journalists, and I want to be sure this won't happen again in my country. Do you think spyware should be banned in democratic nations? I think that in some cases when it comes to law enforcement operations against criminals, terrorists, drug traffickers and smugglers, these tools can be useful. After all, criminals also have access to such technologies as well as the ability to hack computers, he said. But for governments, it's like in Spider-Man: with great power comes great responsibility. If you use these tools, you must do so responsibly and uphold the principles of democracy. Francesco Cancellato: I want to know that I live in a democracy where no one spies on journalists One of the three publicly identified surveillance targets, Husam El Gomati, is known for his criticism of government actions against migrants. This week, TechCrunch revealed another name - Beppe Caccia, who is also an activist in an organization assisting migrants. The common thread appears to be immigration enforcement by Italian intelligence agencies AISE (External Intelligence and Security Agency Intelligence) or AISI, Italy's domestic intelligence and security service, and an attempt to locate information that would lead to the capture of immigrants and those who help them. Both agencies are Paragon clients, though according to Israeli sources, AISI has since been cut off from its services. The Italian government initially tried to distance itself from the affair. Later, government spokespeople acknowledged that seven Italian citizens had been monitored using the spyware, but insisted it was not by the Italian government. That same evening, John Fleming, the executive chairman of Paragon's U.S. subsidiary, announced that the company suspended services in Italy. Paragon requires that all users agree to terms and conditions that explicitly prohibit the illicit targeting of journalists and other civil society figures, he told The Guardian. We have a zero-tolerance policy against such targeting and will terminate our relationship with any customer that violates our terms of service. The farce continued this week when Luca Ciriani, Italy's minister for Relations with Parliament, claimed in a parliamentary discussion that Paragon had not cut off Italian intelligence from its services. On the same day, AISE chief Giovanni Caravelli appeared before the Italian parliament's intelligence oversight committee to provide a briefing on the case. According to reports in Italian media, he denied that AISE had spied on Cancellato. תוכנת ריגול / Illustration: Shutterstock / View gallery תוכנת ריגול / Illustration: Shutterstock (Illustration: Shutterstock) This is likely true, but an Israeli source said that other evidence was presented to the committee by another organization, suggesting that the journalist had engaged in activities beyond his reporting and that some of the human rights activists whose phones were hacked had previous criminal convictions. Italy's political system bears a strong resemblance to Israel's. Since the scandal broke, opposition parties have seized on it. In a rare show of unity, they held a press conference at the European Parliament, joined by three surveillance targets, demanding an EU-led investigation into spyware abuse in 13 countries, saying it is a serious breach of journalistic rights and freedoms. Former Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi summed up that the Paragon scandal cannot simply be brushed aside. Those who are responsible must be held accountable. The unusual Israeli move and the concerns in the U.S. It is still too early to determine the full impact of the scandal on Paragon. Last year, the Israeli cyber firm was acquired by the American private equity fund Aero-Equity (AE) for $500 million, with the deal set to increase to $900 million if the company meets certain business targets. Paragon now operates as an American subsidiary of AE, headquartered in Virginia and led by John Fleming, a former senior CIA official. Two days after the sale was announced, an unusual event occurred: Israel's Defense Ministry issued an official statement declaring that the sale had not been approved and that it was examining the sale procedure and its implications. This was an extraordinary move. Normally, companies do not go public with such deals without obtaining all necessary approvals from Defense Ministry, and the Defense Ministry rarely airs its dirty laundry in an official statement. The announcement led to speculation that political considerations played a role, with some suggesting that Ehud Barak's involvement in Paragon may not have been to certain officials' liking. Perhaps anticipating such uncertainties, the Defense Ministry clarified that all decisions by the Ministry of Defense are based solely on professional considerations. The Ministry has not received inquiries regarding the sale from any political or private entity. פאראגון / Paragon is not legally required to obtain prior Defense Ministry approval (Photo: PR) / View gallery פאראגון / Paragon is not legally required to obtain prior Defense Ministry approval (Photo: PR) (Photo: PR) Ultimately, the sale went through. Paragon, as it turned out, was not legally required to obtain prior approval from the Defense Ministry, so the ministry's announcement that it did not approve the deal was correct but misleading. The law mandates that companies notify the ministry within 30 days of a sale, after which the ministry has the authority to retroactively object. Paragon remains an Israeli company subject to oversight by the Defense Export Control Agency (DECA), which must approve all transactions involving its technology. In fact, it was DECA that ultimately severed Paragon's ties with the Italian intelligence agency after the company reported suspicions that its spyware had been misused in violation of licensing terms. American media outlets are now raising their own questions about the Paragon affair and its potential impact on U.S. politics. One key issue is whether the Trump administration will continue using Israeli spyware. During Trump's first term, the FBI reportedly obtained a limited license to evaluate NSO's Pegasus spyware, though officials claim it was never used in investigations within the United States. In recent years, U.S. authorities have taken enforcement actions against Israeli offensive cyber firms, including NSO, Candiru and Intellexa (founded by former Israeli intelligence officer Tal Dilian). These companies develop spyware capable of hacking into virtually any phone, accessing all its documents, photos and recordings, and even remotely activating the device's camera and microphone. They have been accused of selling their technology to repressive regimes, which allegedly used it to track, persecute, and even eliminate political dissidents. In 2021, the Biden administration blacklisted NSO and Candiru, stating that their technologies enabled foreign governments to engage in transnational repression, posing a national security threat to the United States. מארק צוקרברג / Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP) / View gallery מארק צוקרברג / Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP) (Photo: Susan Walsh/AP) Paragon's legal battle with Meta is also raising eyebrows within the U.S. cyber industry, as it appears to contradict Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy of maintaining good relations with the Trump administration. Meta's public confrontation with Paragon could disrupt the operations of American security agencies that are Paragon's customers, such as Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), both of which Trump has championed. The American media is now asking a troubling question: Could the new administration, which has openly stated its intention to use government power against its political opponents, whom Trump has called the enemy within, utilize Paragon's spyware as part of that effort? Should Americans affiliated with the Democratic Party, military personnel, members of Congress, intelligence agents and former government officials be concerned about surveillance on their phones or even legal action against them? A source in the cyber industry told us that Paragon retains the authority to decide who its clients are and can terminate contracts with customers it does not trust. Could that principle ever extend to the U.S. government? That's hard to imagine, the source admitted.|2025-03-16|https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/ryc4uibikl
Nicolas Cage's upcoming turn as a noir-styled web-slinger just got more intriguing with news that Amazon might double down on the period aesthetic. According to actor Lukas Haas, the highly anticipated Spider-Noir series from Amazon MGM Studios could potentially be released in both color and classic black-and-white formats. This stylistic approach would perfectly complement the show's 1930s setting and film noir inspiration, giving viewers multiple ways to experience Cage's unique interpretation of the Marvel character. The potential dual release format is an exciting use of streaming technology to enhance storytelling and visual presentation and potentially sets a new precedent for how superhero content can be presented on digital platforms. Videos by ComicBook.com In an exclusive interview with ComingSoon, Haas shared behind-the-scenes details about the production's commitment to authentic noir visuals. It was just an incredible project, he said. Everybody involved was amazing. Brendan Gleason, he plays my boss. Just getting to, to do that noir thing. It was very genuine film noir, the way they filmed it, like the long shadows. We filmed it in — I think it may come out in both black and white and color, but when we filmed it, the monitors were all black and white, so you got this feeling and it looked very, very authentic, Haas continued. To the point that I would actually go and look at the monitor and think I was looking at some older footage, but it was actually just a monitor of what was on the camera at the time. They did a beautiful job with the filters and all that stuff, making it look like genuine old 1930s, black and white film. But obviously, just the writing, and Nic is incredible. It's just a really fun project and I cannot wait to see how it turns out. [RELATED – Spider-Noir: Who Could Be the Villain in Sony's Spider-Man Noir Series?] Streaming platforms often offer flexibility that traditional television networks don't, including variable episode lengths and multiple viewing options. This technological advantage could allow Amazon to present both a stylized black-and-white version that captures the essence of classic film noir and a color version that might appeal to viewers who prefer a more contemporary visual style. The series features an impressive ensemble cast alongside Cage and Haas, including Lamorne Morris, Gleeson, Li Jun Li, Abraham Popoola, Jack Huston, and Karen Rodriguez. Co-showrunners Oren Uziel and Steve Lightfoot are at the helm of this collaborative production between Sony Pictures Television, Lord Miller Productions, Pascal Pictures, and Amazon MGM Studios. Filming for Spider-Noir began in mid-2024 and concluded in February 2025. Though no premiere date has been announced yet, the show will debut first on MGM+ in the United States before arriving on Amazon Prime Video. The potential black-and-white presentation seems particularly fitting given the character's origins. Spider-Noir exists in an alternate Marvel universe set during the Great Depression, where Peter Parker becomes a hardboiled detective-like figure fighting crime in a world influenced by pulp fiction and film noir aesthetics. Cage, currently enjoying a career renaissance with critically acclaimed performances in films like Longlegs and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, seems perfectly cast to bring this uniquely stylized Spider-Man to life. If Amazon does release both versions, it will represent a creative approach to superhero storytelling that honors the character's comic book roots while offering audiences a distinctive viewing experience that stands apart from the more colorful, effects-driven superhero content dominating screens today.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/nicolas-cage-spider-man-noir-may-release-in-black-white/
You won't want to miss the April lecture from the Central Kentucky Chapter of the American Institute of Architects (AIA-CKC). While Frank Lloyd Wright didn't build any buildings in Louisville, his presence is still felt throughout the city, and certainly the state, where only one of his designs was realized. Historian William B.

Vehicle-to-load cables let users power appliances from vehicle batteries by converting current. Photo: Jennifer Dudley-Nicholson/AAP PHOTOS As winds howled and warning messages echoed through southeast Queensland in the lead up to Cyclone Alfred, Richard Barge recharged his electric car and set aside its specialty cable. Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading When the lights flickered to black at 10pm last Saturday, his family was ready to turn them back on. We didn't know how long the blackout would last so we connected the fridge first, he says. Once we realised it was using so little power, we plugged in more appliances. The household, in Brighton on Brisbane's northside, used an MG4 - one of a growing number of electric vehicles that offer vehicle-to-load technology. The feature is being credited with keeping the lights on for many households in Queensland and northern NSW, letting users plug in lights, computers, phones and white goods to vehicle batteries. Queenslanders preparing for a cyclone rushed to buy V2L cables to keep the lights on. (HANDOUT/MG) Queenslanders preparing for a cyclone rushed to buy V2L cables to keep the lights on. (HANDOUT/MG) But experts say the technology is not widely known and many potential users didn't find out about it until the cyclone loomed, causing a desperate race for accessories and missed opportunities. Vehicle-to-load technology, also known as V2L, is a feature in electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, including models from BYD, Ford, Kia, Hyundai and Mitsubishi. The feature lets users power appliances from the vehicle's battery by converting direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC) when they plug an adaptor into the vehicle's charging port. The Brighton household had this adaptor cable ready when the lights went out on Saturday, Mr Barge says, and what started as a way to save food in the fridge became a way to power lights, smartphones and the family's television through a 36-hour outage. For the price you pay for the cable, it's good insurance to be able to charge all of your devices, your laptop and your phone, and access the internet, he told AAP. I'm surprised it doesn't come with the car. While Mr Barge purchased his V2L adaptor early, many EV owners in the path of the cyclone were not aware of the feature or prepared to use it until the weather system neared. For the small team working at EVChargers, in a warehouse in Dandenong, Victoria, that became clear days before the cyclone was forecast to make landfall. On Saturday, we were just tidying up ... and the printer that spits out package tickets just started printing out one or two every minute, EVChargers spokesman James Selmes says. It didn't let up. It kept going through the Sunday into Monday and we realised it was Cyclone Alfred getting near the coast. For many EV owners, Alfred arrived too quickly for them to switch to a V2L option. (Jason O'BRIEN/AAP PHOTOS) For many EV owners, Alfred arrived too quickly for them to switch to a V2L option. (Jason O'BRIEN/AAP PHOTOS) Hundreds of electric vehicle owners placed orders for V2L equipment every day in the lead-up to the weather event, Mr Selmes says, and the six-person team worked 12-hour shifts and prioritised orders from the region to meet them. A large number of orders are still flooding into the business, he says, as EV owners prepare for future events. While the technology may not be widely known, V2L has appeared in Australian vehicles since 2021 and can power several large appliances for long periods. Some vehicles output as much as 3.6 kilowatts, which Mr Selmes says is enough to meet the needs of most homes and keep appliances running for several days. A typical EV will power your house for two, three or four days, depending on how you use it, he says. It means homeowners can fully utilise the investment they've made in their electric vehicle - it's not just to get them around, it's also to power their house in times of need. Some vehicles will be capable of powering households for up to 10 days using V2L technology, Australian Electric Vehicle Association national president Dr Chris Jones says, as long as users do not try to power several heating and cooling appliances at once. The recent cyclone could become a coming-of-age moment for V2L technology, he says, as seeing and reading about the real-life experiences could help to demystify its use. It's not like people had to drop the vehicle battery out and rig something up with wires or MacGyver their way into a solution, Dr Jones says. The fact you can just plug something in will make a lot more people think 'I might go out and pick up an adaptor now because it's just such a handy feature'. V2L is a feature in various electric and plug-in hybrids including new models from BYD. (HANDOUT/BYD) V2L is a feature in various electric and plug-in hybrids including new models from BYD. (HANDOUT/BYD) Those who do plan to use the technology should try to plan ahead, Mr Selmes says, to avoid being lost in another race for equipment.

Dr. Bob Arnot of Health Tech Without Borders told Newsmax Saturday that the ongoing debate in America about fluoride in public water systems is justified because ingesting too much can lead to serious health issues. If you get to higher doses, it can lower IQ in children. So developing children, it's, you know, it's a huge concern for parents, Arnot told Saturday Agenda. It's also a very big concern for older individuals who may have hip fractures — again, if they have those higher doses. And so it's rightly sort of left to individual communities.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — (AP) — President Donald Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on the Houthi-held areas in Yemen on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said 13 civilians were killed in the capital, Sanaa. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S. leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program. Trump has said he will not allow it to become operational. The Houthis reported explosions in their territory Saturday evening, in Sanaa and the northern province of Saada, the rebels' stronghold on the border with Saudi Arabia. Images online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least 13 people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. A U.S. official said this was the beginning of air strikes on Houthi targets that are expected to continue. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. Another spokesman, Mohamed Abdulsalam, on X, called Trump's claims that the Houthis threaten international shipping routes false and misleading. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing off Yemen in response to Israel's latest blockade on Gaza. They described the warning as affecting the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when this ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic and other problems at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood there, terrifying women and children. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The Eastern Geraf is home to Houthi-held military facilities and a headquarters for the rebels' political bureau, located in a densely populated area. The Houthis reported fresh strikes on the southwestern Dhamar province late Saturday. They said the strikes hit the outskirts of the provincial capital, also named Dhamar, and the district of Abs. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. However, Saturday's operation was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration. Such broad-based missile strikes against the Houthis were carried out multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of Saturday's mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said. ___ Baldor reported from Washington and Magdy reported from Cairo.

James Conner rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns Sunday as the Arizona Cardinals stayed in the NFC West race with a 30-17 win over the New England Patriots in Glendale, Ariz. Conner blew it open in the fourth quarter with a pair of 1-yard scores as Arizona (7-7) snapped a three-game losing streak. Quarterback Kyler Murray completed 23 of 30 passes for 224 yards as the Cardinals outgained New England 395-311. Rookie quarterback Drake Maye hit 19 of 23 passes for 202 yards with a touchdown and an interception for the Patriots, who fell to 3-11. Rhamondre Stevenson led their rushing attack with 69 yards on 13 attempts. Arizona is 1 1/2 games behind Seattle, pending the outcome of the Seahawks' game against Green Bay on Sunday night. The Cardinals lost both games to the Seahawks this season, so they lose any tiebreaker for the division title. Arizona established a 10-0 lead in the first quarter as former New England kicker Chad Ryland hit the first of his three field goals, a 49-yarder, at the 7:13 mark. Then Jonah Williams recovered Greg Dortch's fumble in the end zone with 1:21 remaining in the period. Joey Slye nailed a 50-yard field goal with 2:01 left in the first half to get the Patriots on the board, but Ryland answered by hitting a 35-yard attempt with 16 seconds remaining for a 13-3 lead at the break. Ryland made it 16-3 with a 40-yard field goal at the 9:07 mark of the third quarter, capping a drive that ate nearly six minutes of clock. The first of Conner's touchdown runs came with 10:39 left in the game for a three-score lead. New England got into the end zone on its next possession via Maye's 3-yard scoring strike to DeMario Douglas with 8:14 remaining. But Conner sealed the outcome on his second touchdown run with 3:27 on the clock. Maye capped the scoring with a 5-yard run at the 1:55 mark, capping a 70-yard drive.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/cardinals-stay-in-playoff-picture-with-win-over-patriots/
Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he's kicking out the new Ambassador from South Africa — accusing him of hating America and hating Donald Trump. It's the latest salvo against South Africa, which has been in the administration's crosshairs since Trump took office in January. In a fiery post on X on Friday, Secretary Rubio called Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool a race baiting politician and said he was considered a persona non grata. Rubio's ire came after Rasool said in an online seminar hosted by a South African think tank that the MAGA movement was partially in response to worries about demographic change and a future when white Americans would no longer be the majority. So in terms of that — the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement — the Make America Great Again movement — as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon, said Rasool. The South African government on Saturday scrambled to contain the fallout, issuing a short, terse statement. Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for the South African president, called the ambassador's expulsion regrettable. We urge all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter, he said. South Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America. Things have been tense between the two allies, after Trump falsely accused the South African government of confiscating land from white farmers and invited white Afrikaners to resettle in the US as refugees. Thirty years since the end of apartheid most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority. The government recently passed a bill aimed at addressing that, but contrary to Trump's claim, no land has been seized. South Africa's government said it was, quote, ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged. Trump also cut all financial aid to South Africa, citing the alleged persecution of the Afrikaners as well as South Africa's genocide case against US ally Israel at the Hague. Rubio snubbed South Africa last month too, by failing to attend the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting. South Africa is the current G20 president but Rubio said he was skipping the event because the summit had DEI and climate change on the agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also opted out of the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Cape Town after the US objected to the themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability. South African-born Trump adviser Elon Musk has also attacked South Africa for what he says are its racist ownership laws, that prevent him from taking his Starlink satellite service to the country unless he meets affirmative action requirements. Ambassador Rasool was South Africa's envoy to the US once before, from 2010 to 2015. When he was a child, Rasool's family was forcibly removed from their home during apartheid when the government declared their suburb a whites only area. He went on to become active in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. In his speech on the webinar that caused Rubio's outrage on Friday, the ambassador said South Africa needed to be cautious and diplomatic in dealing with Trump's administration.

(TNND) — The United States began to carry out a series of military airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday under the order of President Donald Trump. This comes as an effort to open international shipping lanes in the Red Sea that the Houthis have blocked off for months through attacks. The Biden administration conducted similar strikes but largely failed to fully stop the attacks. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump wrote on Truth Social. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. Trump also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. The Houthis reported a series of explosions Saturday evening. Images online show black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes an expansive military facility. The airstrikes come after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel stopped aid from coming into Gaza amid their with Hamas. They warned of additional consequences for Hamas if there was not an extension in the ceasefire as negotiations continue over the second phase.

The Houthis, who face economic issues have since launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home. This comes as part of Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that has torn the Arab world's poorest nation apart. The Israeli military has not commented on the attacks. The Houthi media office said that the U.S. airstrikes hit a residential neighborhood, the Associated Press reports. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was solely a U.S. operation, according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike under Trump's second term in office.

Like most technology advancements that came before it, artificial intelligence feels like the Wild West. But instead of Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name, this villain (or antihero, depending on your outlook) emerges as RoboCop. Featured Video The lack of regulation amid AI's exponential growth is probably exciting to most attendees of 2025's South By Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Texas. The festival began on March 6, and alongside futurism and psychedelic drugs, AI was a primary focus of the conference's sessions across industries. The eager anticipation is easy to understand, as AI's uses seem beyond imagination, and the profit incentives are present. A McKinsey & Company 2023 report found that generative AI is poised to unlock $4.4 trillion in value. It could inject $1 trillion into the U.S. GDP alone. However, as much as panelists throughout the festival touted the benefits of AI, several could not ignore its pitfalls. Advertisement AI experts have concerns There's so many ways this could go wrong, said Oji Udezue, an AI product expert and investor, at a panel on the risks of simulated data. Unfortunately, this stuff is above regulation… We need a way to force people, lazy people to do this. Finding high ethics builders in the world today is an exercise in frustration. Another panel at the conference took a more systematic approach to discussing AI risks. However, it was framed as a way to protect companies utilizing AI from reputation-crushing headlines rather than protecting their customers. AI headlines are good, right? Innovation of AI in headlines is good, said Liz Grennan, a partner at McKinsey & Company and expert on operational risk assessment. But there are headlines you do not want. We do not want consumers, patients as victims for consuming AI. So we're trying to avoid that. Advertisement Paired with what appeared to be AI-generated art, the panelists proposed a hypothetical situation involving a medical patient of an underrepresented background. A company's AI-powered cancer screening software repeatedly marked the patient as clear—only for her to be later diagnosed with Stage 4 cancer, a result of the AI's incomplete or biased data. This situation doesn't just mark a risk for companies' reputations; it quite literally becomes life or death for everyday people when AI is used in a medical context. Will AI eliminate human bias or perpetuate it? It's no secret that human-conducted research and the resulting data contain bias. For example, the National Highway Transit Safety Administration reported that women were 17% more likely than men to be killed in car accidents. But when the organization audited car manufacturers' test processes, they found several were not using female test dummies whatsoever, skewing the results. Advertisement Such human biases in research have a domino effect in our daily lives, from what legislation is passed to who receives certain kinds of medical treatment. But many AI advocates argue that using the technology for data simulation can help eliminate human bias in training AI models, by simulating data from underrepresented groups. Synthetic data is artificially generated rather than collected from real-world events, allowing for the creation of datasets that include diverse and equitable representations of various demographic groups, BetterData, a synthetic data company, argues in a blog post. This helps address issues like underrepresentation and limited features that often lead to biased AI models. Simulated data is another attempt at reducing costs, namely of acquiring robust data sets. But as synthetic data usage grows, it would, in turn, make real world data all the more valuable. And despite the argument that synthetic data will create fuller datasets, many believe that data not based in reality will expound upon biases from our unrepresentative data. But synthetic data has other risks. Advertisement AI models are at risk of collapsing A Naturestudy from July 2024 found that AI models collapse when trained repeatedly on synthetic data. As AI usage becomes more popular on the internet and open AI models scrape AI-generated content to train themselves, the result could be a terrifying ourobouros. That's without mentioning the environmental impact of AI. The data centers that power and train AI models are set to approach 1,050 terawatts of energy usage by 2026, per MIT News. That would bump data centers to the fifth largest electricity consumer in the world—on the list between the energy usage of the entire countries of Japan and Russia. So, how do get ahold of this looming loose cannon? Advertisement Most leaders in the industry at SXSW argued for human intervention at several steps in the AI model building process. Their discussion of AI regulation isn't much different from the U.S.'s attempts at transparency around food. What are AI nutrition labels? Several experts have proposed AI nutrition labels, which, like the FDA-enforced ones that appear on your box of Cheez-Its or your Advil, detail important information about the ingredients of the model. This transparency would make the intent, the uses, and the risks of AI models clear to both individual consumers and businesses. Several panelists also denoted easing in with low-risk use cases as an important factor in how we rev up AI's role in our lives. For example, AI's usage in mental healthcare sounds incredibly risky for such a sensitive use case, especially amid a lawsuit alleging that a Character.AI chatbot pushed a teen to commit suicide. Advertisement But Emily Feinstein, executive vice president at the non-profit organization, Partnership to End Addiction, explains the program's use of AI to train its mentors. Instead of utilizing AI chatbots to be the direct point of contact for those in need of mentorship, the organization's use of ReflexAI's generative AI allows them to train real human mentors in a more personalized way and at a faster pace. If you're not thinking about, talking about risk, and in the habit of thinking about, talking about risk at work, then you're probably missing things, and you're probably not taking it seriously enough, she said at a panel on Tuesday. Should we risk it? But mental healthcare, which is naturally sensitive to risk, Feinstein said, is different from other use cases. Other industries, say creative ones like music, are much less touchy—at least from the point of view of those trying to implement AI. Advertisement Music generator Suno, which launched last year, admitted to training its model on essentially all publicly available music on the internet, which includes copyrighted works. The company was sued, alongside another company called Udio, by the Recording Industry Alliance of America for the use of its members' copyrighted music. The company claimed it fell under fair use. The controversial company has been called out by others in the industry for sucking the creativity out of music. Suno's co-founder Mikey Shulman was flamed online last month for stating that making music is hard, and that's the problem they're trying to solve. Vickie Nauman, founder of digital music consulting agency CrossBorderWorks, said at a SXSW panel on AI in the music industry that Shulman has a fundamental disconnect in the power and purpose of music. Well, I mean, usually the best things in life are kind of hard, she said at the panel Thursday. You do have to put a little effort into life, and then you do have that sense of ownership. I don't know that making 10,000 songs in an hour for a penny a piece is that, you know? How is that satisfying? How is that pushing creativity? It's actually not very creative. But without leaders taking a proactive consideration of ethics in their implementation of AI, the regulation of AI will play out in the courts. At least, that's the point of view of Grennan, who spoke at the panel on company ethics and AI governance. Advertisement There will be people suing, and then court findings, and then standards being set, she said. If it's all a lawsuit waiting to happen, then the most the average joe can do is proceed with caution and laugh at AI's attempts at capturing human creativity. Oh, and maybe try to avoid the chatbots.|2025-03-16|https://www.dailydot.com/news/artificial-intelligence-sxsw/

ISTANBUL Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that international partners increasingly acknowledge Ukraine's diplomatic efforts, emphasizing that Russia must show genuine intent to end the war or face increased pressure. Speaking in Kyiv to journalists, Zelenskyy said discussions in Jeddah had reinforced Ukraine's position, making it a shared stance among allies. He welcomed a proposal from US President Donald Trump for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, saying Ukraine supports it as a step toward a sustainable peace plan. If Russia agrees to a ceasefire, it must demonstrate its willingness to end the war, or it will show that it wants to continue. This is what everyone is waiting for, Zelenskyy said. He asserted that if Moscow rejects the proposal, it would indicate not just opposition to Kyiv but also direct disagreement with Trump. Putin is simply finding a position to avoid ending the war, he claimed. Addressing security concerns, Zelenskyy dismissed Russian reports of encircled Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region, calling them lies from Putin. He said Russian forces were attempting to surround Ukrainian troops within Ukraine, but Kyiv's military command was aware of the situation. The Ukrainian leader also stressed the need for written security guarantees, saying Germany and Türkiye had raised the issue of post-war reconstruction. This is a very positive signal. It shows that everyone believes the war can be ended, he said. On NATO membership, Zelenskyy reaffirmed that Russia should have no veto over Ukraine's defense alliances, saying: They have no legal authority here, and we should not give them the chance to exert such influence. He emphasized that a strong Ukrainian military is essential for both Ukraine's defense and European security. Everyone understands that at the current pace, Ukraine and Europe can be strengthened within five years. We believe this is too long and too dangerous, he said, urging faster action on military production and allied commitments.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says he's kicking out the new Ambassador from South Africa — accusing him of hating America and hating Donald Trump. It's the latest salvo against South Africa, which has been in the administration's crosshairs since Trump took office in January. In a fiery post on X on Friday, Secretary Rubio called Ambassador Ebrahim Rasool a race baiting politician and said he was considered a persona non grata. Rubio's ire came after Rasool said in an online seminar hosted by a South African think tank that the MAGA movement was partially in response to worries about demographic change and a future when white Americans would no longer be the majority. So in terms of that — the supremacist assault on incumbency, we see it in the domestic politics of the USA, the MAGA movement — the Make America Great Again movement — as a response not simply to a supremacist instinct, but to very clear data that shows great demographic shifts in the USA in which the voting electorate in the USA is projected to become 48% white, and that the possibility of a majority of minorities is looming on the horizon, said Rasool. The South African government on Saturday scrambled to contain the fallout, issuing a short, terse statement. Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for the South African president, called the ambassador's expulsion regrettable. We urge all relevant and impacted stakeholders to maintain the established diplomatic decorum in their engagement with the matter, he said. South Africa remains committed to building a mutually beneficial relationship with the United States of America. Things have been tense between the two allies, after Trump falsely accused the South African government of confiscating land from white farmers and invited white Afrikaners to resettle in the US as refugees. Thirty years since the end of apartheid most commercial farmland in South Africa is still owned by the country's white minority. The government recently passed a bill aimed at addressing that, but contrary to Trump's claim, no land has been seized. South Africa's government said it was, quote, ironic that the executive order makes provision for refugee status in the US for a group in South Africa that remains amongst the most economically privileged. Trump also cut all financial aid to South Africa, citing the alleged persecution of the Afrikaners as well as South Africa's genocide case against US ally Israel at the Hague. Rubio snubbed South Africa last month too, by failing to attend the G20 Foreign Ministers meeting. South Africa is the current G20 president but Rubio said he was skipping the event because the summit had DEI and climate change on the agenda. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also opted out of the G20 Finance Ministers meeting in Cape Town after the US objected to the themes of solidarity, equality and sustainability. South African-born Trump adviser Elon Musk has also attacked South Africa for what he says are its racist ownership laws, that prevent him from taking his Starlink satellite service to the country unless he meets affirmative action requirements. Ambassador Rasool was South Africa's envoy to the US once before, from 2010 to 2015. When he was a child, Rasool's family was forcibly removed from their home during apartheid when the government declared their suburb a whites only area. He went on to become active in South Africa's anti-apartheid movement. In his speech on the webinar that caused Rubio's outrage on Friday, the ambassador said South Africa needed to be cautious and diplomatic in dealing with Trump's administration.

[Elvis Ogina, Standard] When she made history in 2022 by outmuscling political titans and veteran politicians to clinch the Meru governorship, many were waiting to see how Kawira Mwangaza would navigate the murky political waters. Despite her win, several tides had lined up against her, which would later contribute to her downfall as she now faces a challenging moment for a career she had built with grit, prayers, and sheer hard work to win the hearts of voters. Observers believe it will take extreme luck for her to weave her way back to the powerful seat as she struggles with a deficiency of political goodwill even if she were to lodge another successful appeal. But it had been coming. To some observers, her goose was already cooked even before she was officially sworn in after running what they believed was a campaign that had left her exposed. They believe her own mistakes in the early days of her stint in office, as well as the perpetual state of campaigns in Meru, which has seen several leaders salivate for her seat, long before the 2027 General elections, contributed to her downfall. Firstly, she had contested and won as an independent candidate, an aspect that robbed her of the usual backing that party candidates always enjoy. Save for the residents and a few MCAs who had stuck with her, Mwangaza struck a lonely figure backed only by her husband and his characteristic guitar. In the end, not even her last-ditch attempt to decamp to President William Ruto's UDA party could save her. She came into the office with a promise to have a people-centred administration, pledging her key goals would be to free the people from the shackles of poverty, indignity, and bad leadership. I fully understand the gravity and responsibility that you have put on my shoulders. I do not take it lightly but I am ready for the task. I will get it done, she said. Mwangaza had also hosted MPs at her official residence in the leafy Milimani suburb to forge unity to achieve her development agenda. But that camaraderie was short-lived as, shortly afterward, rifts between her and other leaders began to emerge, first with the Ward reps who impeached her for the first time barely 122 days into office, setting off two years of tribulations for Mwangaza. A senior politician claimed that Mwangaza failed to forge a working agreement with other leaders and was arrogant in her earlier days in office. As a leader elected on an independent ticket, she was expected to work extra hard to win political goodwill from others who subscribe to the doctrines of other parties. She failed to do so, said the leader. According to the leader, the decision by Mwangaza to incorporate close associates and family in the management of the devolved unit further dented the confidence of the political class with her leadership.

Unlike in the past, Mwangaza remained mum on whether she would stage another fight within the courts by appealing the High Court judgment. Time, too, is not on her side as political players push to have her deputy, Mutuma M'Ethingia sworn in as the fourth governor, an event expected to take place on Monday morning at Mwendantu Grounds at the edge of Meru Town. With her political opponents, who include former Governors Kiraitu Murungi, the Devolution Empowerment Party leader, Peter Munya, the Party of National Unity (PNU) leader and UDA's Mithika Linturi (UDA) commanding the MCA numbers in the Assembly, Mwangaza was living dangerously as a politician. That vulnerability probably cost her seat, says Gibert Mutwiri, a political pundit. Munya and Linturi want to be governor, as is Senator Kathuri Murungi of UDA. Mwangaza had no chance of surviving because she has no party, he said. Being without a party was always going to make her support in the Assembly hard. Especially because her political opponents control the parties with the biggest number of MCAs in that House. No MCA would go against his or her party leader. Kawira had nobody to run to for support in the assembly, said Mr Mutwiri. He added, But we should give her some credit. She is a strong woman, and despite that, she managed to get 20 MCAs on her side. Though she joined UDA recently, she had not gained acceptance as she probably desired, say analysts. She arrived at UDA too late. Because Meru is on campaign mode, with Munya and Linturi going around the county to look for support. There are calls for Kiraitu to come out of political retirement, too. The future does not look bright for Mwangaza at the moment, he added. In the region, experienced politicians are already burning the midnight oil as they seek to capture the seat. It is a political temperature that never subsided even after the 2022 General Elections in the region. Munya had already announced plans to recapture Meru County Governor's seat from Mwangaza, further unsettling the county chief. Munya was Meru's first Governor from 2013 to 2017. The former Agriculture CS has been opening PNU offices in various parts of Meru to popularise the outfit and run against Governor Mwangaza and other candidates, including Mithika Linturi, also a former Agriculture CS. I will vie for Meru governor. I apologize for not running in 2022 because you had expected me to vie. I had different thoughts, he said recently. Meru has got a lot of problems and that was not the wish of the people. We supported Mwangaza but she has not delivered. The people expected development and their wishes have not been fulfilled. That is what we want to correct, Munya said. Linturi, who was dropped from the Cabinet last year, has also declared his candidature and was among the titans whose influence affected Mwangaza's stature. Linturi is among the few leaders who had erected billboards with political messages regarding their political plans. For instance, a huge billboard erected by Linturi towers the skies of Meru with the message Restoring Meru's lost glory together . John Mwangi, a resident, believes the rising political temperatures infiltrated into the county assembly and contributed to MCAs crafting a case against Mwangaza. She was fighting several battles, and she did not have control of the assembly. She was always on the defensive while also struggling to deliver projects that politicized, he says. As she fought political battles with those keen on unseating her, another fight was developing at the County Assembly as she sought to save her seat after failing to rally MCAs to support her cause. The disagreements spiralled into a series of impeachment efforts by MCAs, albeit with failures. Her key project proposals also hit brick walls as MCAs pushed back against her. By the time the courts confirmed her impeachment on Friday, nearly all members of her cabinet were also facing an impeachment over alleged incompetence by MCAs who were keen to halt her progress. It is the culmination of a sustained effort by the County Assembly to remove Mwangaza from office after four other attempts flopped. Meru County Governor Kawira Mwangaza at Bunge Towers, Nairobi.

Denmark's Holger Rune beat Daniil Medvedev 7-5, 6-4 to reach the Indian Wells ATP Masters final on Saturday, denying the Russian world number six a third straight trip to the title match. Rune, ranked 13th, snapped a seven-match losing streak in semi-finals and will face either two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz or Britain's Jack Draper on Sunday. It means everything, Rune said. The job is not over yet, but it feels amazing. Playing Daniil is one of the toughest challenges for me on tour. I obviously had the right tactics, but it was still so difficult because he puts in great effort and is super solid. In a rematch of last year's quarter-finals, the 21-year-old Rune showed admirable discipline against the Medvedev's vaunted defense, sticking in the rallies and keeping the Russian off balance with a variety of shots while making judicious use of his powerful forehand. After an early exchange of breaks in the opening set, Rune managed to grind out a key hold for 4-4, saving one break point in a game that went to deuce six times and lasted nearly 11 minutes. He gained the decisive break for a 6-5 lead and pocketed the set when his rolling backhand drew another error from Medvedev. The second set was a more straightforward affair after Rune broke Medvedev at love for a 2-1 lead. After two nervy points as he served for the match, Rune rallied from 0-30 down and survived another mammoth rally to give himself a match point, punctuating the victory with a forehand winner. It's about finding the right tempo, and luckily I've got good leg work, so I can reach many balls, Rune said. It's about finding the right pace and which shots to hit, because so many players miss too many shots against Daniil. He makes you go for more, so I'm super proud that I managed to find the right rhythm. Rune, whose ascent has slowed since he burst on the scene in 2022 with a victory over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final, reached his first tour-level final since Brisbane in January of 2024. bb/sev|2025-03-16|https://www.the-messenger.com/news/national/article_ee382461-500e-594b-b7c2-02c3b2c39acc.html

From Mirror staff reports Peoples Natural Gas company is filing a request with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to increase natural gas rates as of Oct. 1. Peoples has requested an overall gas cost rate increase of $45.7 million per year. Based upon current tariff rates, if the company's entire request is approved, the total bill for a residential customer using 80 thousand cubic feet per year would increase from $96.02 to $102.39 per month or 6.6%. The PUV will examine the requested rate change and can prevent existing rates from changing until it investigates and/or holds hearings on the request. The company must prove that the requested rates are reasonable. After examining the evidence, the PUC may grant all, some or none of the request or may reduce existing rates. The PUC may change the amount of the rate increase or decrease requested by the utility. As a result, the rate charged to customers may be different than the rate requested by the company.|2025-03-16|https://www.altoonamirror.com/news/local-news/2025/03/peoples-eyes-gas-rate-increase/

WALPOLE — Town residents want more local control within the Fall Mountain Regional School District, and they're deeply unsatisfied with it. And soon they'll learn if it's possible for the town to leave the district. Voters approved a measure by secret ballot, 134-21, at Walpole's annual town meeting Saturday to direct Fall Mountain to study the feasibility of Walpole leaving Fall Mountain. This vote will also trigger a similar study for Langdon, after residents at that town's annual meeting Tuesday approved a similar measure that was contingent on Walpole's vote. Fall Mountain will be responsible for funding both studies. In addition to Walpole and Langdon, the Fall Mountain district covers Acworth, Alstead and Charlestown. Alstead voters rejected a study of their town leaving the district at the polls on Tuesday. Saturday's meeting in Walpole drew 157 people to the gymnasium of the elementary school. At last year's town meeting, voters overwhelmingly approved forming an informal Walpole school withdrawal study committee, citing concerns with the costs of being in the regional school district. Consisting of seven residents, the advisory group met weekly and explored the feasibility of withdrawing from the district and reorganizing to form a Walpole school district. In September, the committee recommended that the town pull its students from Fall Mountain. Jamie Teague, an at-large school board member for Fall Mountain who was re-elected last week, was the only person to speak Saturday in opposition to Walpole's article on formally studying withdrawal. The board has committed to investigate different structures to allow more autonomy for the towns that want it, Teague told the audience. The school board announced in late January plans to study the feasibility of changing its articles of agreement. The announcement came roughly two months after the board said it was considering possible changes to the articles to give member towns more local control. However, school board Chair Alissa Bascom, of Charlestown, said at the time that if any towns in the district vote to study withdrawal from the district, the board will not be doing the study. Walpole resident Craig Vickers, who formerly served as chair of the school board, said the board has known about the town's dissatisfaction with the district for several years. He said this dates back to 2019, when a committee was formed to look at the district's articles of agreement amid an attempt in Charlestown to withdraw from the district. I love Fall Mountain. ... But it's broken, Vickers said. If we do this, it's just so we can get honest and accurate numbers and make a decision from there. There's no agenda. It's just that this isn't working right now. Residents who spoke in favor of the measure to study withdrawal say the move would give the town more control over finances and curriculum decisions. Tom Ronning, the former principal of Fall Mountain Regional Middle/High School and a member of the informal withdrawal study committee, said Walpole School staff are required to adopt curriculum that serves the Fall Mountain district's needs. Curriculum and teacher innovation has been restricted, and that's so all of the district schools do the same thing, he said. We believe we can provide a better educational program and lower the per-pupil cost by managing our own schools. ... We believe we can do a better job managing our own tax dollars to provide our own opportunities for our students. Withdrawing from a school district is a lengthy process. It involves forming a district-wide committee to study the withdrawal, the State Board of Education's approval of a withdrawal plan, and residents across the school district giving the go-ahead for a town to withdraw. Walpole voters passed the rest of the town warrant Saturday with little discussion and no amendments. Voters approved a total budget of $5,521,228. This figure includes the town operating budget of $4,737,098, as well as $219,681 for the water operating budget and $564,449 for the sewer operating budget. The measure passed by a voice vote. Residents also approved establishing a police building capital reserve fund for money to build a new police station, and to put $55,000 into that fund. Selectboard member Steve Dalessio said Saturday that the town officially closed on the purchase of the land on Upper Walpole Road near Shaw's grocery store for the site of a new police station. Voters approved a measure to purchase a new police vehicle for $80,000, with half of the funds coming from the town's police capital reserve fund. The other half will come from the town's unassigned fund balance, according to Selectboard Chair Cheryl Mayberry. Walpole voters also approved raising $280,000 to purchase a six-wheel truck. The majority of the funds, $200,000, will come from unspent highway block grant money from previous years, and the remaining $80,000 will come from the town's highway capital reserve fund. This year has been particularly difficult on the road department, Dalessio said. We've only had two working trucks to plow the town during storms, lots of repairs and lots of breakdowns. ... This will give us another truck, which will take roughly a year to get, and help get our fleet back up. Voters greenlit a measure to add $400,000 to the municipal building capital reserve fund. Mayberry said funds had to be withdrawn this year to repair the north side of the town hall. Residents also approved funding for a few more capital reserve funds, including $25,000 for the highway capital reserve, $15,000 for the police department and $26,000 for the town-wide assessment capital reserve. Also at the meeting, Moderator Jack Wozmak swore in new town officers, including Jean Kobeski, Jana Sellarole and Gail LaHaise, who each won a three-year library-trustee seat.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/walpole-voters-overwhelmingly-approve-fall-mountain-withdrawal-study/article_1ba536d4-01d7-11f0-b12e-b3f01ed90207.html

BANGKOK (AP) — An airstrike by Myanmar's military on a central village under the control of resistance forces has killed at least 27 civilians and injured 30 others, an opposition group and Myanmar's online media said Saturday. The attack occurred Friday at 3 p.m. in Let Pan Hla village in Singu township, about 65 kilometres (40 miles) north of Mandalay, the country's second-largest city, a spokesperson for the Mandalay People's Defense Force said. The military did not comment on Saturday. Myanmar has been in turmoil since the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, 2021, triggering widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict. The military government has stepped up airstrikes against the armed pro-democracy People's Defense Force and ethnic minority guerrilla groups that have been fighting for greater autonomy for decades. The two groups sometimes carry out joint operations against the army. The resistance forces have no defense against air attacks. The town of Singu was seized by the Mandalay People's Defence Force (MDY-PDF), which supports Myanmar's main opposition, in July last year. The group's statement released Saturday on its Telegram social media channel said six children were among the 27 killed in the airstrike that targeted crowded market stalls in Let Pan Hla village. Osmond, the group's spokesperson, told The Associated Press that about 10 houses near the village market were destroyed by bombs. This airstrike was not aimed at a military target, but rather at the market area, where civilians visit daily, Osmond said in a message. The situation in the village could not be independently confirmed, with access to the internet and cellphone service in the area mostly cut off. The independent Myanmar Now online media reported that the death toll from the airstrike that hit a tea shop near the village market had reached 30 and seven were in critical condition. A report issued last month by Nyan Lynn Thit Analytica, a Myanmar research and advocacy organization, said that since the military's 2021 takeover, 2,224 civilian had been killed and 3,466 wounded in 4,157 airstrikes.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/world/2025/03/15/an-airstrike-in-myanmar-kills-nearly-30-people-an-opposition-group-says/
The license of an Aiken funeral home owner has been suspended. The South Carolina Board of Funeral Service temporarily suspended Cody Anderson's funeral director/embalmer license, according to an entry on the South Carolina Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation website. Mr. Anderson looks forward to an opportunity to appear before the Board to resolve this issue, Anderson's attorney, Rob Tyson, said in a statement. The LLR complaint does not relate to any improper actions or inactions taken by Mr. Anderson in his capacity as a licensed funeral director. A management change was implemented in 2024 and George Funeral Home & Cremation Center will continue to operate as it has for the past 105 years serving the Aiken community with dignity and compassionate funeral and cremation services, the statement continued. Anderson purchased George Funeral Home in 2018. The suspension comes after Anderson pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit bank fraud Feb. 11. Mr. Anderson regrets his involvement in the circumstances which led to his February 11, 2025 plea and has taken responsibility for his actions, Tyson added. However, Mr. Anderson's recent plea is completely unrelated to his work as a licensed funeral director. As part of a plea agreement, U.S. Attorneys Scott Matthews and Winston Holliday agreed to drop the other two charges — bank fraud — when Anderson is sentenced. Anderson's co-conspirator, Thomas Allen Bateman Jr., was sentenced to two years in prison on March 3. Both men's charges stem from an attempt to obtain the $20 million estate of Mary Margaret Wenzel Crandall after she died Jan. 5, 2022. Anderson used an online service to create a will for Crandall, who was in her 80s and suffering from dementia, and ordered three George Funeral Home employees to serve as witnesses when Crandall signed the document in the George Funeral Home parking lot in the spring of 2021. Bateman befriended Crandall after her husband died in 2012, served as her power of attorney and drove her to the funeral home. Anderson was named personal representative in the will and stood to receive 5%, or $1 million, of the estate. Bateman was to receive the remainder and provide Anderson with enough to pay off his mortgage. But, the plan fell apart after Crandall's accountant and lawyer successfully challenged the validity of the will. The Rev. Scott Ayers took over day-to-day management of the funeral home in late 2023.|2025-03-16|https://www.postandcourier.com/aikenstandard/aikenstandard/news/crime/aiken-crime-cody-anderson-george-funeral-home/article_d7662e30-fab8-11ef-b6d2-cf5e28ca23f2.html

Violent tornadoes that ripped through parts of the U.S. proved deadly as well as destructive as whipping winds moved east into the Mississippi Valley and Deep South on Saturday, with at least 26 people killed and scores of homes decimated.The most fatalities as of Saturday morning were in Missouri, authorities said, which was lashed by twisters overnight that resulted in at least 11 deaths. The Missouri State Highway Patrol also reported that multiple people were injured.Video above: Tylertown, Mississippi, tornado caught on cameraThe deaths included a man who was killed after a tornado ripped apart his home. It was unrecognizable as a home. Just a debris field, said Coroner Jim Akers of Butler County, describing the scene that confronted rescuers when they arrived. The floor was upside down. We were walking on walls. Rescuers managed to save a woman in the home, Akers said.Officials in Arkansas said Saturday morning that three people died in Independence County and 29 others were injured across eight counties as storms passed through the state overnight. We have teams out surveying the damage from last night's tornadoes and have first responders on the ground to assist, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said on X. In the meantime, I just released $250,000 from our Disaster Recovery fund to provide resources for this operation for each of the impacted communities. On Friday, meanwhile, authorities said three people were killed in car crashes during a dust storm in Amarillo in the Texas Panhandle.The deaths come as a massive storm system moving across the country unleashed winds that triggered deadly dust storms and fanned more than 100 wildfires.Extreme weather conditions — including hurricane-force winds — are forecast to affect an area home to more than 100 million people. Winds gusting up to 80 mph (130 kph) were predicted from the Canadian border to Texas, threatening blizzard conditions in colder northern areas and wildfire risk in warmer, drier areas to the south.Video below: Storm moving over Marion County, AlabamaEvacuations were ordered in some Oklahoma communities as more than 130 fires were reported across the state. The state patrol said winds were so strong that they toppled several tractor-trailers. This is terrible out here, said Charles Daniel, a truck driver hauling a 48-foot (14.6-meter) trailer along Interstate 40 in western Oklahoma. There's a lot of sand and dirt in the air. I'm not pushing it over 55 mph. I'm scared it will blow over if I do. Experts say it's not unusual to see such weather extremes in March. What's unique about this one is its large size and intensity, said Bill Bunting of the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. And so what that is doing is producing really substantial impacts over a very large area. Tornadoes hit amid storm outbreakThe Storm Prediction Center said fast-moving storms could spawn twisters and hail as large as baseballs, but the greatest threat would come from straight-line winds near or exceeding hurricane force, with gusts of 100 mph (160 kph) possible.The center said parts of Mississippi, including Jackson and Hattiesburg, and areas of Alabama, including Birmingham and Tuscaloosa, would be at a high risk. Severe storms and tornadoes were also possible across eastern Louisiana, western Georgia, central Tennessee and the western Florida Panhandle.Wildfires break out amid dry, gusty conditionsWildfires in the Southern Plains threatened to spread rapidly amid warm, dry weather and strong winds, and evacuations were ordered Friday for some communities in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and New Mexico.A blaze in Roberts County, Texas, northeast of Amarillo, quickly blew up from less than a square mile (about 2 square kilometers) to an estimated 32.8 square miles (85 square kilometers), the Texas A&M University Forest Service said on X. Crews stopped its advance by Friday evening.About 60 miles (90 kilometers) to the south, another fire grew to about 3.9 square miles (10 square kilometers) before its advance was halted in the afternoon.High winds also knocked out power to more than 260,000 homes and businesses in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Indiana, according to the website poweroutage.us.Blizzard warnings in Northern PlainsThe National Weather Service issued blizzard warnings for parts of far western Minnesota and far eastern South Dakota starting early Saturday. Snow accumulations of 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 centimeters) were expected, with up to a foot (30 centimeters) possible.Winds gusting to 60 mph (97 kph) were expected to cause whiteout conditions.___Julie Walker reported from New York.

Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010. The 41-year-old suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during his first drive with New York in 2023 and experienced one of the worst seasons of his career in 2024, leading the team to a 5-12 record.|2025-03-16|https://wrko.iheart.com/content/2025-03-15-aaron-rodgers-preferred-next-team-revealed/
France swept to the Six Nations title with a 35-16 victory over Scotland on Saturday, edging out bitter rivals England whose 68-14 rout of hapless Wales had sent the championship battle down to the wire. On a chilly night in Paris, France held their nerve to emerge champions for the first time since their Grand Slam-winning campaign of 2022. Les Bleus, who were only 16-13 ahead at the break at the Stade de France, ran in four tries to secure a bonus-point victory and a one-point winning margin over England in the final standings. Ireland's slender hopes of wrapping up a third successive Six Nations ended despite defeating Italy 22-17 in Rome in the day's opening match. France full-back Thomas Ramos starred with 20 points to lead his team to victory, making light of the absence of iconic scrum-half Antoine Dupont who was injured in last week's victory in Ireland. We showed resilience in defence second half, when we only conceded three points, said France defence coach Shaun Edwards. Ramos's haul included a try as part of a 19-point blitz in 20 minutes just after the interval although France missed out on the Grand Slam after their narrow round two loss away to England. France controlled the opening quarter to lead 10-0 thanks to a converted Yoram Moefana try and Ramos penalty. By the 25-minute mark, the hosts were down a man as hooker Peato Mauvaka was yellow-carded for a headbutt on scrum-half Ben White. Finn Russell cut the deficit before Ramos reinstated the 10-point advantage to make it 13-3, which moved him ahead of Frederic Michalak as Les Bleus' leading scorer. Winger Darcy Graham crossed for Scotland with Russell then bringing his side level. Ramos re-established the three-point lead three minutes from the interval but Scotland were denied the lead when Blair Kinghorn's foot was adjudged to be in touch in the build-up to Tom Jordan's try. Just after the break, Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored a record-equalling eighth try in one campaign. Since the World Cup in 2023 he has gotten better and better, and hopefully he gets better again. He is a sensational athlete, a wonderful guy, said Edwards. Ramos added the extras to make it a 10-point game with 35 minutes left and he stretched the lead with a try off a rolling maul. His sixth successful kick made it 30-16 before Moefana added his second try of the night. - 'Happy to finish well' - In Cardiff, England scored 10 tries with a bonus-point triumph which had temporarily moved them top of the table and piled the pressure on France. England had their match in Wales all but wrapped up at half-time after scoring five tries to lead 33-7 at the break. Captain Maro Itoje opened the scoring as early as the third minute, with Tom Roebuck, Tommy Freeman, Chandler Cunningham-South and Will Stuart all following the skipper's lead. Scrum-half Alex Mitchell, debutant Henry Pollock, with two of his own, Joe Heyes and Cunningham-South again added five more tries between them in the second half. That allowed England to surpass their previous record Six Nations winning margin over Wales of 40 points set during a 50-10 success at Twickenham in 2006. The team has been progressing, this is a young and evolving team, said England coach Steve Borthwick. For Wales, their 17th successive Test defeat represented an unwanted record for a Tier One country in the professional era. Their 11th straight championship loss meant they had finished with back-to-back wooden spoons for the first time. - 'Emotions raw' - It's a very difficult one to reflect on, especially now because the emotions are quite raw, admitted Wales interim coach Matt Sherratt. In Rome, Italy took the lead at the Stadio Olimpico through Monty Ioane's 12th-minute try. However, the Azzurri played more than half the match at least a man down after Michele Lamaro and Giacomo Nicotera were yellow-carded, while No 8 Ross Vintcent was shown a 20-minute red card for a head-on-head challenge. Ireland hooker Dan Sheehan scored a hat-trick of tries, with full-back Hugo Keenan also crossing Italy's line. Happy with five points, we probably needed a bit more points difference, Sheehan told ITV. Gonzalo Quesada's Italy side finished fifth in the table with five points, two points above Wales. We were not all that far away off getting a win which would have been incredible but at the same time there's a lot of which we can be proud, said Quesada. bur-jdg-dj/mw|2025-03-16|https://www.sanfordherald.com/news/national/france-sweep-to-six-nations-title-as-england-hand-wales-record-humiliation/article_dfaf5f8d-ac1b-56bc-9090-2f56206899d9.html

DUBLIN, Ohio (WCMH) — Organizers of Dublin's St. Patrick's Day Parade said the event would go on Saturday morning rain or shine, and they meant it. Thousands of people lined the streets of Historic Dublin for the 'Greenest, Grandest Parade.' I think it really speaks to the tradition. It's one of those where people know they're going to be here every year before St. Patrick's Day and they want to celebrate, Alison LeRoy, director of events for the city of Dublin, said. Leroy spent all morning monitoring the forecast, hoping the severe weather would let up in time for the parade. It was still raining at the start, but more than 100 groups braved the weather and walked the parade route. Leading the parade was this year's Grand Leprechaun, Barb Anderson. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement I get to be on the float with my family. So I have eight other people in my family that are on the float, Anderson said. Anderson was selected by Dublin's mayor and previous Grand Leprechauns. They said they chose her because of her involvement in numerous local organizations, including work with the Dublin Food Pantry and her role as president of the Safe Alliance of Interfaith Leaders. Anderson has lived in Dublin in 35 years and said she knows how much it means to serve as the Grand Leprechaun. It is such a great honor and I'm just so humbled by the other people that have been named leprechauns over the years. They are a wonderful group of people and Dublin is just such a great city in which to serve and volunteer, which I just love to do, she said.

HALIFAX — After placing a framed photo of U.S. President Donald Trump on a table, Matthew Burke steps back and takes a mighty swing with a baseball bat. Glass shatters as the frame explodes. The obliterated image vanishes. Satisfied with his effort, the 14-year-old — dressed in dark coveralls, a paintball mask and body armour — high-fives his older sister and mother. Welcome to the Rage Room in Halifax, where clients have been lining up to take part in the SMASH The Tariffs Special Event. With the purchase of a regular smash room package, such as Anger Management, or Parental Leave, every patron gets a free Trump picture to destroy at will. Framed photos of Vice-President JD Vance and Tesla CEO Elon Musk cost an extra $5, with proceeds going to local food banks. When asked why he wanted to take a swing at the president's picture, Burke said: It's about how he's treating this country. The lanky boy then shuffled across the windowless room, its wooden floor covered in glass shards, broken dishes and smashed pottery. His 17-year-old sister, Lillian, used a golf club to thrash her photo of the U.S. commander-in-chief with 13 direct hits. I came here to safely get some frustration and anger out, she said, her voice muffled by the plastic mask. He is not a very smart man and he is currently doing some not very smart things. Terry LeBlanc, owner of Rage Room Halifax, says he's been hearing how people are feeling anxious and upset in the wake of Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs and his threats to annex Canada through economic force. It's actually been a bit overwhelming, the response, LeBlanc said in an interview Friday. But it's been great. It really shows that Canadians don't want to be the 51st state. LeBlanc, CEO of the Rage Room for almost seven years, said the rooms allow people to relieve stress in a safe, healthy way — and his customers don't have to clean up the mess. Typically, the items offered up for destruction include dishes, glassware, home appliances, big-screen TVs and various electronics, all of them discarded from local thrift stores. Much of the battered waste left after the mayhem is shipped off for recycling. A basic bashing session — Smash It 101 — costs $49. Rage rooms, also known as anger rooms or smash rooms, have been around for several years. While their use is often described as a recreational, self-help activity, some research has suggested they may do more harm than good. Studies have found that physical outbursts of aggression teach your body to respond to feelings of stress, anger and frustration with violence, according to an article posted earlier this month on website Verywell Mind, which is overseen by a board comprised of mental health professionals. The article cites the work of three researchers whose 2019 paper, Explosive matters: does venting anger reduce or increase aggression? was published in the Journal of Aggression, Maltreatment and Trauma. Still, LeBlanc says there's no disputing how his clients are feeling when they leave the rage rooms. Most people who walk out of here have a big smile on their face, said LeBlanc, a burly man with a long, salt-and-pepper beard, who used to work in the glass business. We always like to ask what was their favourite thing to do. Lately, smashing Donald Trump has been number 1. Still, LeBlanc says he's not terribly interested in politics or psychoanalyzing why people are keen to bash Trump's image. We're entertainment first, he said. We're not therapists. We're not doctors. People come here to have some fun and blow off some steam .... Everybody wins. Over the years, people from all walks of life have entered one of his small, battered rooms to let loose. He recalled a chief executive from a major insurance firm showing up one day in a tailored, pinstriped suite. He wanted to smash a teacup and teapots, LeBlanc said with a snicker. He was British .... There's something about breaking something that, at one time, grandma would have said, 'No, don't touch that.'|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/03/15/clients-of-halifax-rage-room-take-aim-at-portraits-of-us-president-donald-trump/
This week, we find ourselves in the early days of a specific liturgical season known as Lent. Lent is a designated time observed by Christians of many different expressions all around the world. It spans the 40 days, not including the Sundays, that run from Ash Wednesday up to the Saturday before Resurrection Sunday. While over the years it has been observed by certain segments of the Christian Church, or maybe culturally practiced in certain parts of the world, over the last handful of decades, partaking in the methods of observing Lent has grown in use by Christians far and wide. The word Lent comes from an old English word that means spring. The practice, although not prescribed in the Bible, is one that Christians have engaged in for centuries. It actually traces its development to the practices of some of the first generations of the Christian movement. We know that early on in the church's history, it was commonplace for new converts to be baptized on Easter Sunday. The days and weeks ahead of Easter Sunday then were used as a catechism, or an intentional time of preparation ahead of one's baptism. Those preparing to undergo baptism would spend dedicated time studying scripture, praying, discerning God's will for their lives, and engaging in various activities with their faith community. All of this was intended to cultivate a deeper sense of connection to God and the church. Over the centuries, this practice has morphed into a time of intentional preparation for Easter itself, reflecting the common practices of observing Lent we often hear of today. This prescribed time of forty days takes its influence from stories in scripture itself, such as the forty days that Jesus spent in the desert following his own baptism. Typically, engaging the framework of the Lenten season would see a follower engaging in practices associated with three main themes: Prayer/Scripture, Fasting, & Almsgiving (or charitable acts). The practice of prayer and scripture reading is intended to focus one on their need for God's forgiveness and to foster a more faithful pursuit of God's presence in their lives. In these 40 days, you want to go above and beyond the regular practices you may already observe or step outside of your normal practices and engage God in new or different ways. Some ways to take on this might be locating a Lenten-specific devotional series readily available online or at your preferred bookseller. Maybe you read through the entirety of one of the gospels during these 40 days. For prayer, you may take on a different practice, such as using tried and true models like the Ignatian Prayer of Examen, or practicing your prayer life differently, such as going for a walk to have a conversation with God as your prayer time. The act of fasting is probably what you most commonly associate with Lent, as the practice of giving up something for Lent has taken on its own sort of cultural popularity in recent years. So much so that often the deep spiritual foundation of fasting is lost. Much in the way Jesus fasted in the desert for 40 days following his baptism (Matthew 4:2), the practice of observing a fast by followers today is intended to help us re-enact the absence of something in order to remind us of what we ultimately need to be truly filled, Jesus. While you can give up soda, sweets, or social media, the purpose is really to disassociate yourself with something that may limit your ability to connect more deeply with God. The idea is that you would replace the time, energy, or benefits received from that which you are fasting from in order to redirect that effort to encounter Christ. Finally, the third area of Lenten observance is almsgiving, or acts of charity. So much of what we can do to observe Lent is personal and done in isolation. However, this aspect of Lent's framework is one way in which we can observe the season outwardly. The act of doing something for someone else is a way for you to respond to the goodness of God you have received by extending that grace, generosity, and love to others. Here again, the theme of sacrifice rings loudly as the intent is to give something of yourself (time, money, or effort) to benefit someone else. Your act could be the giving of money to a local organization serving community members, a specific ministry in your church that does similar work, or you can take up volunteering at one of our many local non-profits around Robeson County. No matter your experience with Lent, I would hope that those who are following in the ways of Christ would be open to considering ways that could push them to experience the heart of God more. Each of the three main elements of Lent's framework of practice are rooted in scriptural instructions or events, many of which are found in the life of Jesus himself. So whether you've incorporated Lent into your spiritual journey for years, or maybe you are considering engaging in it for the first time, I encourage all of us to use the weeks leading up to Resurrection Sunday to ponder the themes inherent in the Season of Lent, themes that admittedly may not always be fun to talk about. Themes like, on our own, there is nothing we can do to earn or deserve Jesus' gracious gift of life everlasting or a relationship with God Almighty, or Humanity is flawed, subject to error, and incapable of being good enough for God. However, in doing that reflection, it reminds us of the power that Jesus has to make all those things a reality for us. It prepares us to once again acknowledge the sacrifice of Jesus on Good Friday, the one who bore the weight of our shortcomings and extended forgiveness to us. It is the remembering that readies us for the Hallelujahs and the He is risen! shouts of Easter morning. So no, while Lent in of itself holds no supernatural power, the tenets, themes, and time spent praying, fasting, and giving can make the sacrifice of Jesus all the more meaningful for us. Therefore, I encourage you in this Lenten season, whether it is your first time or the fiftieth time, to try out one of the practices (or two). Push yourself to reflect more about the depths of what the Messiah has done for each of you. Blessings on your journey.|2025-03-16|https://www.robesonian.com/uncategorized/315597/owens-journey-through-season-of-lent

CAMERON, Mo. (KCTV) - One man was taken to a nearby hospital after he lost control of his vehicle before it flipped along I-35 north of Cameron. The Missouri State Highway Patrol indicates that just before 4:15 p.m. on Friday, March 14, emergency crews were called to the area of northbound I-35 and State Route BB, north of Cameron, with reports of a single-vehicle collision. When first responders arrived, they said they found a 26-year-old Bethany man had been driving a 1999 Buick north on the interstate when he slid out of control. State Troopers noted that the Buick slid off the east side of the interstate, hit the ground and flipped over. The vehicle ultimately landed on its wheels. Emergency crews indicated that the driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, was taken to Harrison County Community Hospital with serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Investigators said the Buick was totaled as a result of the crash. No further information has been released.|2025-03-16|https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/15/driver-seriously-injured-after-car-flips-along-i-35-nw-missouri/
This week in Washington, D.C., Iowa's all-Republican congressional delegation have introduced legislation to lower costs of crop insurance and baby formula. Nunn proposes tax credit for U.S.-manufactured infant formula U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn introduced legislation Monday he says will help prevent another baby formula shortage from occurring. The Infant Formula Made in America Act of 2025, co-led by U.S. Reps. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pennsylvania, and Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, was proposed in response to the 2022 infant formula shortage. The shortage has been attributed to a combination of factors, primarily supply chain issues stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and the recall of Abbott Nutrition products after two infants died from a bacterial infection after drinking formula manufactured at a Michigan Abbott Nutrition plant. Datasembly found that 43% of total consumption of baby formula in the U.S. was accounted for by the Michigan factory, which went out of stock during the recall and subsequent shutdown as the facility investigated the infection. The Center for American Progress stated that three domestic producers, Abbott, Mead-Johnson, and Nestlé, supply roughly 98% of all formula in the country, leading to massive shortages and price hikes when infections or other problems occur at these facilities. Nunn said in a news release the legislation is an attempt to encourage more manufacturers to enter the infant formula industry. The legislation would create a transferrable tax credit for small domestic infant formula manufacturers, with businesses able to receive a credit equal to 30% of their qualified investment each year, and a production tax credit of $2 per pound of infant formula produced. Just few years ago, millions of parents were scrambling to feed their babies – some even traveling miles or paying out-of-this-world prices just to get the formula their child needed, Nunn said in a statement. We may be past that crisis now, but we should work to stop this from ever happening again. By supporting small-sized American manufacturers making infant formula, we can prevent another shortage and keep children fed and happy. Feenstra introduces legislation to extend lower crop insurance costs for beginning farmers U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, alongside U.S. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minnesota, introduced a bill Friday they said will help lower crop insurance costs for new farmers. Under current law, federal crop and livestock insurance programs give certain exemptions and more benefits to beginning farmers and ranchers, as well as veteran farmers and ranchers, for a period of five years. The Crop Insurance for Future Farmers Act proposes extending these provisions to a period of 10 years, which Feenstra said would align with other federal beginning farmer programs. Born and raised in rural Iowa, ensuring that the next generation of Iowa farmers and producers can continue long-held family traditions and grow the food and fuel that our nation and the world depend on is important to me, vital to our economy, and critical to our national security, Feenstra said in a statement. To keep our farmland in the hands of Iowa farmers and away from China and our foreign adversaries, we need to cut operating costs for our young and beginning farmers so that they can grow, compete, and succeed – instead of calling it quits because of financial barriers. … This relief will help our young producers plant their roots in our rural communities, promote farm profitability, and strengthen Iowa's status as the breadbasket to the world. A companion bill has also been brought forward in the Senate by U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune and U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, also spoke about the importance of crop insurance Tuesday in a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing. She introduced Caleb Hopkins, a loan production officer for Dakota Mac in Halbur, who told the committee that crop insurance is the number one risk management tool in the belt for ag lenders, especially when facing uncertainty caused by natural disasters. Ernst said crop insurance is the most effective and reliable risk management tool available to farmers that must remain affordable and accessible. Over the years, Congress has approved multiple rounds of ad hoc disaster payments to help farmers recover from severe weather events, Ernst said. While these payments offer relief in times of crisis, they are slow, they are unpredictable, and subject to political gridlock – leaving farmers uncertain about when or if help will actually arrive. Iowa farmers – who have faced multiple natural disasters in recent years – have made it clear that they need certainty and protection in real time, not months or years after the damage is done. 0 0 0 0 0 Get Government & Politics updates in your inbox!|2025-03-16|https://nonpareilonline.com/news/state-regional/government-politics/article_2dd810e0-019d-11f0-b8e7-6f667944f1dc.html

Here's what you need to know about St. Patrick's Day The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. FILE - A person waves an Irish flag while watching the St. Patrick's Day parade, Sunday, March 17, 2024, in Boston's South Boston neighborhood. Credit: Steven Senne, File, AP NEW YORK — If it's March, and it's green, it must be St. Patrick's Day. The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. And nowhere is that more so than in the United States, where parades take place in cities around the country and all kinds of foods and drinks are given an emerald hue. In fact, it was among Irish American communities that the day became the celebration it is, from its roots as a more solemn day with a religious observance in Ireland. But even in America, it was about more than a chance to dye a river green (looking at you, Chicago) or just bust out a favorite piece of green clothing, it was about putting down roots and claiming a piece of the country's calendar. Who is St. Patrick and why does he even have a day? Patrick was not actually Irish, according to experts. Born in the late fourth century, he was captured as an adolescent and ended up enslaved in Ireland. He escaped to another part of Europe where he was trained as a priest and returned to Ireland in the fifth century to promote the spread of Christianity. Several centuries later, he was made a saint by the Catholic Church and like other saints had a day dedicated to him, which was March 17. He became Ireland's patron saint, and even when religious strife broke out between Catholics and Protestants, was claimed by both, says Mike Cronin, historian and academic director of Boston College Dublin. How did an Irish saint's day become an American thing? The short answer: Irish people came to America and brought their culture with them. St. Patrick's Day observances date back to before the founding of the U.S., in places like Boston and New York City. The first parade was held in Manhattan in 1762. While the day was marked with more of a religious framing and solemnity in Ireland until well into the 20th century, in America it became the cultural and boisterous celebration it is today, marked by plenty of people without a trace of Irish heritage. It was because people in Ireland started seeing how the day was marked in the U.S. that it became more of a festival in the country of its origin rather than strictly a religious observance, Cronin says, pointing to the parades, parties and other festivities that are held. Oh, and by the way, for those who like to shorten names: Use St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day. Paddy is a nickname for Pádraig, which is the Irish spelling of Patrick. The Chicago River is dyed green as part of annual St. Patrick's Day festivities Saturday, March 15, 2025, in Chicago. Credit: Erin Hooley, AP Why is it such a big deal? Holidays aren't simply days to watch bands go by, or wear a specific outfit or costume. Being able to mark a holiday, and have others mark it, is a way of putting down roots, showing that you've made it in American culture, says Leigh Schmidt, professor in the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University. You've made your claim on that American calendar, in American civic life, by having these holidays widely recognized. The spread of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the U.S. was a way for Irish immigrant communities, who in the 19th century faced discrimination and opposition, to stake that ground, he says: It's a kind of immigrant Irish way of combating nativist antagonism against them. What's with four-leaf clovers, anyway? A popular sight around the holiday is the shamrock, or three-leaf clover, linked to Ireland and St. Patrick. The lucky ones, though, come across something that's harder to find: a four-leaf clover. That's because it takes a recessive trait or traits in the clover's genetics for there to be more than the normal 3 leaves, says Vincent Pennetti, who has been fascinated by the plants since high school. Four-leaf clovers are real. They are rare, he says. That doesn't mean they can't be found. People just have to keep their eyes open and get really good at noticing patterns and breaks in the patterns, and they just start jumping out at you, he says. Katie Glerum finds them. She says it's not unheard of for her to be somewhere like out in a park and see one. She usually scoops it up and often gives it to someone else, to a positive response. If it happened every day, then I probably would be less excited about it, she says. But yeah, when it happens, it is exciting.|2025-03-16|https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/nation-world/st-patricks-day-2025-meaning-history/507-1a05aa0e-1e3b-4f87-a62b-9affdee6703e

JAFFREY — Voters passed two warrant articles related to Environmental Protection Agency requirements to maintain clean water during Saturday's annual town meeting. Both articles required and cleared a three-fifths majority, and were voted on by secret ballot. The first allows the town to raise $1.6 million for a roughly $11.6 million effort to remove PFAS and manganese from town water, which was approved 120-5. The second, passed 122-1, allows the town to purchase a $425,000 vacuum truck to complete an EPA-mandated water line inventory. Voters passed several other items during the 2½-hour meeting, including $1,495,000 in appropriations to several capital reserve funds, a contract with public works employees and the creation of an expendable trust fund for ambulance services in town, plus adding $40,000 to it. Additionally, attendees approved a $7,633,215 budget. The discussion in the Conant High School gym Saturday morning was limited, with only a handful of residents asking questions or sharing comments. Several of these statements were in support of warrant articles, none of which proved contentious. During much of the meeting, members of the selectboard and budget committee, as well as the town manager, broke down the information on warrant articles for attendees, which were accompanied by handouts and a detailed slideshow projected behind a table of town officials at the front of the room. Town officials and attendees tackled funding for the PFAS removal project first. Plastics and flame retardants are a source of these man-made chemicals, which have made their way into about 40 percent of Americans drinking water, according to 2024 EPA data. Scientists are still trying to determine the health effects of PFAS, which have earned the moniker forever chemicals, because they take a long time to break down, according to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The EPA sets standards for the quantities of these chemicals permissible in water, and while the town is compliant with the current standards, they are not with new thresholds that went into place last year, which they have a deadline to comply with. The project will bring them into compliance. The $1.6 million will go toward a new water treatment facility, and adds to the $10 million residents approved in 2023. Selectboard member Charlie Turcotte said the funds are needed because the estimated cost of the project has risen since then. Grants and loans with principal forgiveness are covering portions of the project costs. I'm just grateful that this PFAS treatment is being considered and put into action, resident Tory McCagg said. ... As selectmen pointed out, we all need water, and we don't know what the weather is coming up. We might have floods, we might have droughts, and we will need as much fresh, healthy water as we can, and we don't want PFAS in that water. So thank you all so much for all the work you've done on this. I appreciate it. These remarks were met by a round of applause from fellow audience members. Voters then considered the second article related to EPA rules. The agency requires water line inventories, and attendees greenlit the town's purchase of a $425,000 vacuum truck to complete this process. Selectboard member Andy Lawn said purchasing the truck is significantly less expensive than having the EPA take the inventory, which would cost roughly $2.1 million. Additionally, the truck purchase is subject to 70 percent loan forgiveness. Resident Kathy MacKenzie asked whether the town would still be pursuing the inventory regardless of the EPA project. We have to do this, Lawn replied, noting some of what could be discovered in the process. We don't think we'll find lead, but we probably will find copper. That's not good, either. So we just, we have to move forward with this. Resident Keith Dubois, who owns Mountainshade, an excavation business in the town, spoke in favor of the purchase. I rent one of these trucks probably once a week, at a cost of $2,500 to $3,000 a day, he said. This is going to make the highway department's job cleaner and faster and safer. So I support this. After the two ballot votes, attendees considered other money items, including the budget. Voters passed a $7,633,215 budget, up $333,295, or 4.6 percent, from the $7,299,920 approved last year. Additionally, they approved $3,592,877 to operate the town water and sewer systems, which will be funded with user fees and other non-property tax resources, according to the warrant. The town portion of the tax rate will be $11.30, up 73 cents from the 2024 rate. This equates to roughly $3,390 for a house valued at $300,000. Budget committee Chair Norman Langevin said the town is financially healthy. We keep all the residents … in mind when we make our decisions, Langevin told the audience. And I will say that this committee looks at every line by line, he said. And sometimes we're squabbling over pennies more than anything else.|2025-03-16|https://www.keenesentinel.com/news/local/jaffrey-residents-say-yes-to-water-projects/article_68030376-01d2-11f0-ba47-83e3c6bc030f.html
TOOMBS COUNTY, Ga. (WTOC) - The Toombs County Sheriff's Office is investigating the homicide of a 4-year-old girl. At around 7:46 p.m. Friday night, the Toombs County Sheriff's Office got a call referencing an unresponsive child. According to the sheriff's office, the caller said she was on the way to the hospital from their home. Toombs-Montgomery EMS was then dispatched for the call and intercepted the vehicle at an Enmarket convenience store in Lyons. EMS immediately took the child into their care and began life saving measures on the way to a Vidalia hospital. Officials say the 4-year-old girl was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the hospital. The Toombs County Sheriff's Office then contacted the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for assistance. Two individuals were arrested following a joint investigation. 26-year-old Seth Hunter Brown and 29-year-old Taylor Marie Hughes are both charged with felony murder, malice murder, cruelty to children in the 1st degree (felony), and aggravated battery. They are both now in custody at the Toombs County Detention Center. The Toombs County Sheriff's Office said this is an ongoing investigation. In a press release, Toombs County Sheriff Jordan Kight extended his condolences to the family. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the families during this difficult time.

Lucy Hale has delighted audiences in many of her projects, but the actress has revealed for each 'yes' she received from a casting director, there have been many more who told her 'no.' The actress, 35, who is dating Australian reality star Harry Jowsey, spoke about one audition that didn't turn out the way she had hoped while promoting her film F*** Marry Kill on Buzzfeed's The Puppy Interview. When asked about various roles the Make You Believe singer has auditioned for, she listed them off while trying to wrangle some adorable pups. 'Oh my gosh, I've auditioned for Pitch Perfect, Hairspray, Hannah Montana, 50 Shades of Grey, The Substance,' she said. 'I feel like, because I've lived in L.A. almost 20 years, everyone who gets the role is always, it's meant to be their thing, but for every 'yes' to an audition, there's like a lineup of 200 that you heard a 'no' for,' she explained. 'I should probably go back like in journals and look at all the things I've auditioned for.' Lucy Hale, 35, has revealed she once auditioned for a role that eventually went to Miley Cyrus, 32; Pictured in Los Angeles in November 2008 / Lucy Hale, 35, has revealed she once auditioned for a role that eventually went to Miley Cyrus, 32.

Even though she didn't get the part, the audition process made an impression on the young future star. 'I remember the audition. It was a taped audition in Tennessee. It was the audition that like made me want to be an actress,' she declared. 'I remember that vividly, it was very cool.' It was on a the Nickelodeon kids' show Josh and Drake where Hale got her first big break. 'I had one word on Drake and Josh on Nickelodeon, and I was 15,' she said of the experience, which still seemed to remember as if it were yesterday.

Note: I am a life-long Hawkeye fan but live just south of Madison. We are Badger wrestling season ticket holders. Bucky has commitments from a handful of in-state guys. While they are great wrestlers, they are not the best of the in-state talent. Heiser, who should win his fourth wrestling for my local high school, is off to Missouri. Herm, another great talent, is off to South Dakota St with Neitzel, a northwestern WI kid. There is very little fanfare concerning the class of 2025. Honestly, until they are on campus and in the program, I am not sure the fan base trusts their commitment. They got a couple pretty solid in-state guys out of the class of 24, but they weren't THOSE GUYS who went to Penn State and Missouri, respectively. We have the season tickets, in part, because we get to see them wrestle some great teams every other year. The fan base seems pretty much done with Bono. The Badger program simply does not have what it takes to be competitive in the BIG. Many are worried the program will not survive long-term, given NIL and the new scholarship limits.|2025-03-16|https://intermatwrestle.com/profile/2207-wrestlingfanforlife/
Uproar swept across Australia this week after an American tourist was filmed snatching a baby wombat from its mother in the wild and sharing the disturbing encounter on social media. Sam Jones, who also goes by Samantha Strable, sparked widespread outrage after posting a video of herself running to a car with the struggling wombat in her hands, later sharing it with her 92,000 Instagram followers. The video ignited international condemnation, with many calling for her to be banned from the country. Just days later Jones voluntarily left Australia. Her departure followed another unrelated incident in which a man allegedly stole a young crocodile from a Darwin wildlife centre. CCTV footage captured a man allegedly breaking into the zoo and taking the crocodile from its enclosure. These two incidents, occurring so close together, highlight a disturbing trend, according to Wild Animals Australia's Cat Coake, who believes they're just the tip of the iceberg. ADVERTISEMENT Speaking to Yahoo News, Coake explained that both travellers and Australian nationals are increasingly exploiting animals for social media content, often prioritising viral moments over the welfare of the creatures involved. She noted that people are becoming increasingly emboldened to handle live animals, sometimes with little regard for their safety or the potential consequences. It's absolutely increasing in prevalence, she said, calling for government intervention. It's happening, and we need tougher penalties, but not only that, we need to enforce the existing penalties that we do have. Wildlife volunteers desperate for government funding Coake stressed the need for authorities to invest more in wildlife protection, expressing frustration with the government's failure to act. We're tired of listening to politicians say 'we want to protect these animals and we'll do this' — and nothing ever gets done, she said. ADVERTISEMENT When animals are taken illegally from the wild, the financial burden falls on the unfunded wildlife volunteer system, which often has to spend tens of thousands of dollars relocating the animals. We're basically left to pick up the pieces, Coake said. And that's if we can even find these animals. She went on to say that governments need to take more decisive action, urging them to impose harsher penalties for wildlife offences. Governments need to take action and they need to come down hard, much harder, on people who commit animal, especially wildlife, offences. Coake also highlighted that cruelty toward wildlife is becoming incredibly common, adding that it should not be the responsibility of rescue crews to push for harsher punishments. ADVERTISEMENT It shouldn't be on us to push the government, who have actual duty of care and ownership of these animals, to begin to look after them, she said. Wildlife stealing is a growing issue in Australia and around the world, with animals being exploited for social media fame, illegal pet trade and sometimes even for sale to the highest bidder. In addition to the trauma caused to the animals, these actions also jeopardise the delicate balance of ecosystems, is cruel, and can be so dangerous . When spotted on social media, Coake urged the public to report the content to authorities and refrain from sharing it. By reporting the content and not sharing it, people can play an important part in putting an end to this exploitation, she said.|2025-03-16|https://au.news.yahoo.com/worrying-native-animal-trend-sweeping-australia-increasing-in-prevalence-232201126.html

Fans are still heralding Bernie Mac as one of the greatest acts in comedic history as they continue to laugh at one of his most memorable jokes. The late entertainer died of pneumonia complications following a lengthy battle with the inflammatory lung disease sarcoidosis in 2008. He was 50 years old. But a resurfaced clip from HBO's late night program The Chris Rock Show has allowed fans to relive the genius of Mac's storytelling. The stand-up legend appeared on the show for the season 5 premiere, where he spoke about his 25-year marriage to his high school sweetheart Rhonda McCullough. The two wed in 1977 and are parents to one daughter, Je'Niece McCullough. Bernie Mac retells hilarious story about his wife in a resurfaced clip. (Photo by Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty Images) Mac joked that his better half was sassy as hell early on in the relationship and that his notoriety and fame had not affected McCullough's take-charge demeanor much. I ain't gon' sit up here and try to put up this cool daddy thing. I'm scared of mine. I don't know what it is. I weigh more than her. I know I hit harder. … But it's the mouth. It's the mouth, said the Friday actor. Man, I came in late the other day … She said, 'You ain't going nowhere tonight.' I said, 'I'm going out, honey.' She said, 'You ain't going no got damn where tonight.' I said, 'Baby, who the hell you think you talking to?' I said, 'Look at my birth certificate. I'm 42 years old.' She said, 'You wanna be 43?' This is a true story, man, recalled Mac as he sent the audience into a fit of laughter. Against his better judgment, the comedian went out and was a nervous wreck the entire time. My pager kept going off and everybody was teasing me and everything, he said. I said, 'Man, let me use your phone. I'm sick of my wife calling me.' I'm frontin', I'm really frontin', The Bernie Mac Show star continued. When he called home, he unleashed. 'Hello … don't ask me a got damn thing, just pay attention. … Don't worry about where the hell I am. I'm in my skin. I'll be home, godd—mit, when I get there, and when I get there, I better have something to eat, and it better be hot, and it better be good, he said. 'You think I'm bullsh–ting?' I said, 'Let me speak to your mama,' he said, revealing that his assertions had been made to his daughter. A repost of the joke on Instagram moved one user to write, Bernie was truly one of the greatest comedian ever. Miss him so much. A second person acknowledged that Mac was one of one as they commented, They don't make em like this anymore. On YouTube, a fan noted, 2025 and still funny as hell, about the comic's unique comedic prowess. The Original Kings of Comedy star featured the joke in various stand-up routines, where Rhonda, Je'Neice, and other relatives were characters that generated laughs.|2025-03-16|https://atlantablackstar.com/2025/03/15/you-think-im-playing-bernie-mac-revealed-to-chris-rock-the-moment-his-wife-sent-chills-down-his-spine/
Ukraine has a new 600-mile cruise missile, the Long Neptune, and has fired it at Russia. We have significant results, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced Saturday. Long Neptune has been tested and successfully used in combat. A new Ukrainian missile, an accurate strike. The range is a thousand kilometers. That's 620 miles. The Long Neptune is a longer version of Ukraine's 17-foot-long Neptune anti-ship cruise missile—the truck-launched weapon that sank the Russian Black Sea Fleet flagship Moskva in April 2022. Long Neptune, which is longer and holds more fuel than the 120-mile standard Neptune, has been in development for years. When Zelensky pledged recently that Ukraine would produce 100,000 long-range munitions in 2025, he was partly referring to the Long Neptune—as well as to a host of far-flying explosive drones, the most impressive of which can travel more than 1,000 miles to strike targets deep inside Russia. Deep strikes The successful deployment of Long Neptune Zelensky referred to was apparently the March 14 strike on the oil refinery in Tuapse, in Russia around 300 miles from the front line in Ukraine. That Tuapse attack was just the latest in a chain of Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities that depressed production by around 10% last year. Long Neptune is an important weapon. Striking harder than do-it-yourself attack drones, some of which are modified sport planes, the new missile helps free Ukraine from its partial dependency on the United States and Europe for its best deep-strike munitions. The U.S. under President Donald Trump is, at best, an unreliable ally. And Europe lacks the capacity to produce the large numbers of modern cruise missiles Ukraine needs. Other made-in-Ukrainian munitions are coming, including air-launched glide bombs and ground-launched ballistic missiles. Even as Trump leans on Ukraine to accept a possible U.S.-brokered ceasefire that would favor Russia, Zelensky's government is preparing for the war to grind on—and for attacks deep inside Russia to continue … if not escalate.|2025-03-16|https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidaxe/2025/03/15/ukraine-has-a-600-mile-cruise-missile/

Create a free account to read this article or signup to continue reading It's about bringing people together, celebrating heritage and sharing stories over a meal. But for 40 days, Rev Suli will go without lamb and beef - staples in a Tongan diet - to bring awareness to the ways individuals can cut their food emissions by half. I'm usually a big meat eater and I feel like as a Pacific Islander we do everything around food and meal times, so it's been quite challenging, she told AAP. I'm a mother of four and caring for my elderly mother who lives with us, and they're all still eating meat so I'm having to make my own separate meals. The decision to go without meat is part of the 40 for the Future challenge, taking place during Lent and co-ordinated by UnitingWorld, a leading charity working with communities across the Pacific, Asia and Africa. Funds raised by participants will go towards reforestation, disaster preparedness and sustainable farming initiatives. Other challenges include giving up your car for 40 days, aiming to reduce energy use and repairing, reusing and recycling instead of buying new. Rev Suli hopes participating in the challenge will raise awareness for the work Uniting Church has been doing to support vulnerable and less fortunate communities. She also plans to engage with local politicians about climate policies. Climate change can be such an overwhelming topic but we can take small steps and it's about knowing how you can have an impact personally, said the second-generation migrant.

The San Antonio Spurs look to get back on the winning track and even the season series with New Orleans when they host the slumping Pelicans on Saturday. Saturday's game is the second of a home back-to-back for the Spurs as well as the finale of a four-game homestand. New Orleans (18-49) already has been eliminated from postseason contention but San Antonio (27-38) still has a fleeting chance to make the Western Conference play-in tournament. The Spurs enter play Saturday 4 1/2 games behind the 10th-place Dallas Mavericks for the final position with 17 contests remaining. The Spurs dropped a 145-134 decision to Charlotte on Friday, playing for the first time in a month without star guard De'Aaron Fox. The team announced Thursday that Fox would miss the rest of the season with a torn ligament in his left pinkie finger. On Friday, San Antonio could not slow down Charlotte's scoring from the perimeter, going down by 26 points at the break and never seriously challenging for the rest of the game. Stephon Castle led the Spurs with 26 points on Friday while Devin Vassell scored 22. Jeremy Sochan hit for 14, Sandro Mamukelashvili had 13 and Keldon Johnson and Julian Champagnie each added 12 points for San Antonio, which has lost four of its past five games. This league is too good to think that you're going to be able to turn that on or flip a switch (to get back into the game), Spurs acting coach Mitch Johnson said. We tried to make a run a couple of times — we were fighting. You could see the effort and the competitiveness lift a little bit. But that's not how this works. You don't get rewarded sometimes for that type of effort or competitiveness or intensity without execution. The Pelicans travel to the Alamo City after a 113-93 home loss to Orlando on Thursday. New Orleans, which was led by Zion Williamson's 20 points, eight rebounds and five assists, trailed by 30 points at intermission and could do little to make up that deficit in the second half. Trey Murphy III added 17 points in the setback while Jose Alvarado scored 12 (all in the fourth quarter) for the Pelicans, who have dropped five of their past six games. Jordan Hawkins' consistent play has been a positive sign for the Pelicans, as the second-year guard has scored in double figures in nine of his past 11 contests. He's getting healthier, New Orleans coach Willie Green said about Hawkins on Friday. We're making a commitment to be consistent with our minutes for Jordan. That helps, when you know you're going to play 20-plus minutes a game, you can prepare accordingly. It's good to see him get out on the floor and look more like himself. San Antonio won the first game between the teams at home on Dec. 8 before the Pelicans triumphed twice two games in three days in February in New Orleans to take a lead in the season series.|2025-03-16|https://www.921theticket.com/news/spurs-look-to-salvage-split-of-homestand-vs-pelicans/

Australian property owners are being warned to remain vigilant about the invasive and destructive threat of termite infestations after a scary detail was spotted above a garage door. The image, taken in Albany Creek in Brisbane, highlights how infestations can hide in plain sight in our homes. This is subterranean termite workings, known as stalactite, from the garage roof, pest controller Jhy Carroll told Yahoo News of the shocking discovery. When we inspected this house, we also found active termites through the garage walls and skirting boards. While every job is different, he said the cost to eliminate the colony and install a preventative system to protect the building in the future was between $3,000 and $5,000. The warning comes after Yahoo News reported that termites thrive in wetter and more humid conditions, meaning the critters are 'on the move' searching for new places to forage and find food. According to the Australian Museum, termite colonies are formed during warm, humid weather, typically in spring and autumn. While there are over 200 species of termites in Australia, only a few are of concern to humans. ADVERTISEMENT The warmer months of the year are always the most active time for termites, however after all the recent floods these properties that get water ingress are at higher risk of termite activity, Carroll said, referring to the tropical low weather system known as Ex-Cyclone Alfred which hit the east coast last week. If found inside a home, termites can cause serious damage by eating away at wooden structures. The University of Technology Sydney previously discovered that termites cause $ 1.5 billion in damage to homes every year. Yahoo News recently spoke with a couple who were left more than $100,00 out of pocket after they purchased a multi-million dollar property on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland in June last year only to later find a pest report didn't uncover extensive termite damage at the property. How to prevent termites at home According to Carroll, there are two main ways to prevent termites, one is with a chemical barrier and the other is an in-ground baiting system. ADVERTISEMENT Chemical barrier treatment consists of digging a trench around the external perimeter of the home and chemically treating the soil area, he said. While in-ground systems are also installed around the external perimeter of the house, they include a bait that the termites feed on to eliminate the colony .|2025-03-16|https://au.news.yahoo.com/sinister-find-above-garage-door-prompts-warning-over-active-threat-to-aussie-homes-211513173.html
The year is 1976, Paul McCartney's Wings are top of the Billboard charts, and European wine is about to face its biggest fight against America's kids from the sticks . The Judgement of Paris — an event that uprooted the reputation of French wines in favour of Californian underdogs — would shift the wine market between the competing countries. Now, as European alcohol faces a new threat from a looming Donald Trump tariff war, here's how a blind taste test almost 50 years ago first ignited a rivalry between the United States and Europe. The blind taste that changed the game A Parisian taste test between French wines and their Napa Valley counterparts seemed so ludicrous in 1976 that few journalists even showed up. The exception was Time magazine's George Tabar, who viewed the event with skepticism. Everybody knows that French wines are going to win, so why waste a day? he recounted in 2016. It's the giant and the little guy. Nobody took it seriously. At the time, Napa Valley was barely a burgeoning wine destination. Some estimates show there were only 330 wineries in California in 1975, and most were considered eons behind their French rivals in Bordeaux and Burgundy. Not only was Californian wine unpopular overseas, the test's creator, Steven Spurrier, said it did not exist as far as the French were concerned. The British-born Mr Spurrier believed it an unfair assessment and, imbued with a sense of wine justice, he put eight wines from Burgandy and Bordeaux up against 12 Californian rivals. To equal out the contest, he made the then-unusual step of hiding the labels. I was an Englishman in Paris, I was already a square peg in a round hole, he later explained. And these were very, very good wines. So why don't we do something about it? What followed would be called a kick in the rear for French wine . 'Not bad for kids from the sticks' Mr Spurrier's set of judges were nine French wine experts, who Mr Tabar described as an oenophile's Who's Who . Their reactions were, on the surface, predictable. Ah, back to France! exclaimed one — sipping a Napa Valley Chardonnay. That is definitely California. It has no nose, said another, after downing a French label. The esteemed panel first awarded top scores to a 1973 chardonnay from a boutique vineyard in Calistoga, California. Mr Taber called Jim Barrett, the part owner of Chateau Montelena, the vineyard that produced the winning white, for a reaction. Not bad, Mr Barrett responded, for kids from the sticks. Reds were to follow and again, a Cabernet from Californian winery Stag's Leap took out the top prize. Despite French outrage, including from judge Odette Khan who unsuccessfully demanded her scorecard back, the results were undeniable. The US wine market was catapulted into the international Zeitgeist, and today, the number of wineries in California is more than 3,000. Now, decades on, a looming tariff war has unearthed an old rivalry between the US and Europe. France shapes up to 'retaliate' in next big battle On Thursday, the US president threatened to impose a 200 per cent tariff on alcohol from the European Union in a tit-for-tat feud after the bloc's planned 50 per cent levy on American bourbon whiskey. If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES, Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. In response, French Foreign Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said his country would not give in to threats and that it was determined to retaliate . Even after US wine gained global respect, the nation still accounts for 31 per cent of EU wine and spirits exports, according to Eurostat. Likewise, the EU accounted for roughly 40 per cent of all spirits exports in 2023, according to trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States. Champagne company Tattinger said a tariff war would mean their bottle prices could rise from $US60 to $US180 ($95 to $285). Bordeaux Wine Council, the advocacy group for Napa Valley's old foes, says the US still remains the top market in terms of value and volume for wines from the region. And unlike 1976, a tariff spat could threaten the US market too.Loading... In New York, Winestogo Wine & Spirits owner Mario Duta said both parties were playing poker with consumers. I think they need to act like grown-ups, sit at the table and make things fair, he told Reuters. It will definitely affect the consumer because most, if not all of those tariffs are going to be passed on to the consumer. We have certain margins that we have to start at in order to keep the door open. And those tariffs, they will go to the consumer. They will be hurt. It would basically kill certain brands in certain places that would export their items to the US. Australia invokes 'buy local' in midst of war After the 1976 revelation, doors were opened to a whole new world of global wine suppliers, including those in Australia. As Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' Ted Baseler told Time years later that helped other people say, 'Gee, we can too,' whether it was in New Zealand, Australia, Oregon, Washington, Chile . As of 2024, the US remains the third biggest importer of Australian wines, raking in $324.8 million. That's more than 100 million litres of Australian produce a year. In what could be seen as a potential pre-emptive measure, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spruiked the benefits of buying local and invoked Team Australia in a flurry of recent media appearances. Australians can have an impact by buying Australian goods, he told ABC Melbourne this week.

Keep your job come next Election? Before answering an attendee's question about President Donald Trump's destructive and disastrous trade war, U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards made a plea to the rowdy crowd at his Thursday town hall in Asheville, North Carolina. Let me answer and then if you don't like it, you can boo or hiss or whatever you'd like to do, Edwards said, visibly exhausted. As he expanded on Trump's use of tariffs as a negotiating tactic, it took less than a minute for the crowd to break out in outrage. He continued to plow ahead in his response and eventually punctuated it by telling attendees he would stop there and you can yell. The crowd gladly took him up on the offer. For about an hour and half, Edwards endured a constant barrage of jeers, expletives and searing questions on Trump administration policies.

Trump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later Trump invoked the 1798 Act Saturday, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2, to speed up mass deportations. President Donald Trump speaks in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Monday, March 3, 2025. Credit: Pool via AP WASHINGTON, D.C., USA — A federal judge on Saturday barred the administration of President Donald Trump from deportations under an 18th century law that Trump invoked just hours earlier asserting the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang and that he had new powers to remove its members from the country. James E. Boasberg, chief judge for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said he needed to issue his order immediately because the government was already flying migrants it claimed were newly deportable under Trump's proclamation to El Salvador and Honduras to be incarcerated there. El Salvador already agreed this week to take up to 300 migrants that the Trump administration designated as gang members. I do not believe I can wait any longer and am required to act, Boasberg said during a Saturday evening hearing in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU and Democracy Forward. A brief delay in their removal does not cause the government any harm, he added, noting they remain in government custody but ordering that any planes in the air be turned around. The ruling came hours after Trump claimed the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua was invading the United States and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping wartime authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action to speed up mass deportations. The act has only been used three times before in U.S. history, all during wars. Its most recent application was during World War II, when it was used to incarcerate Germans and Italians as well as for the mass internment of Japanese-American civilians. In a proclamation released just over an hour before Boasberg's hearing, Trump contended that Tren de Aragua was effectively at war with the United States. Over the years, Venezuelan national and local authorities have ceded ever-greater control over their territories to transnational criminal organizations, including TdA, Trump's statement reads. The result is a hybrid criminal state that is perpetrating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States, and which poses a substantial danger to the United States. The order could let the administration deport any migrant it identifies as a member of the gang without going through regular immigration proceedings, and also could remove other protections under criminal law for people the government targeted. The Tren de Aragua gang originated in a prison in the South American country and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone last decade. Trump and his allies have turned the gang into the face of the alleged threat posed by immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and formally designated it a foreign terrorist organization last month. Authorities in several countries have reported arrests of Tren de Aragua members, even as Venezuela's government claims to have eliminated the criminal organization. The government said Trump actually signed the order Friday night. Immigration lawyers noticed the federal government suddenly moving to deport Venezuelans who they would not otherwise have the legal right to expel from the country, and scrambled to file lawsuits to block what they believed was a pending proclamation. Boasberg issued an initial order at 9:20 a.m. Saturday blocking the Trump administration from deporting five Venezuelans named as plaintiffs in the ACLU suit who were being detained by the government and believed they were about to be deported. The Trump administration appealed that order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. Boasberg then scheduled the afternoon hearing on whether to expand his order to all people who could be targeted under Trump's declaration. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign contended that the president had broad latitude to identify threats to the country and act under the 1798 law. He noted the U.S. Supreme Court allowed President Harry Truman to continue to hold a German citizen in 1948, three years after World War II ended, under the measure. This would cut very deeply into the prerogatives of the president, Ensign said of an injunction. But Lee Gelernt of the ACLU noted the law has only been invoked three times before and contended that Trump didn't have the authority to use it against a criminal gang rather than a recognized state. Boasberg said that precedent on the question seemed tricky but that the ACLU had a reasonable chance of success on those arguments, and so the order was merited. Boasberg halted deportations for those in custody for up to 14 days, and scheduled a Friday hearing in the case. The flurry of litigation shows the significance of Trump's declaration, the latest step by the administration to expand presidential power. Ensign argued that, as part of its reaction to the Sept. 11, 2001 attack, Congress had given the president power to delegate transnational organizations threats on the level of recognized states. And Gelernt warned that the Trump administration could simply issue a new proclamation to use the Alien Enemies Act against another migrant gang, like MS-13, which has long been one of Trump's favorite targets. ___ Associated Press writer Regina Garcia Cano in Caracas, Venezuela, contributed to this report.|2025-03-16|https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/nation-world/judge-limits-trumps-deport-people-under-alien-enemies-act/507-11894e2b-e26c-4121-965a-0d38c250227e
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said he ordered a series of airstrikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, on Saturday, promising to use overwhelming lethal force until Iranian-backed Houthi rebels cease their attacks on shipping along a vital maritime corridor. The Houthis said nine civilians were killed. Our brave Warfighters are right now carrying out aerial attacks on the terrorists' bases, leaders, and missile defenses to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets, and to restore Navigational Freedom, Trump said in a social media post. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World. He also warned Iran to stop supporting the rebel group, promising to hold the country fully accountable for the actions of its proxy. It comes two weeks after the U.S leader sent a letter to Iranian leaders offering a path to restarting bilateral talks between the countries on Iran's advancing nuclear weapons program that Trump has said he will not allow to become operational. The Houthis reported a series of explosions in their territory Saturday evening. Images circulating online showed plumes of black smoke over the area of the Sanaa airport complex, which includes a sprawling military facility. At least nine people were killed, said Anees al-Asbahi, spokesman for the Houthi-run health ministry. In a statement on social media, he said another nine were wounded. Nasruddin Amer, deputy head of the Houthi media office, said the airstrikes won't deter them and they would retaliate against the U.S. Sanaa will remain Gaza's shield and support and will not abandon it no matter the challenges, he added on social media. The airstrikes come a few days after the Houthis said they would resume attacks on Israeli vessels sailing in waters off Yemen in response to Israel's blockade on Gaza. There have been no Houthi attacks reported since then. Earlier this month, Israel halted all aid coming into Gaza and warned of additional consequences for Hamas if their fragile ceasefire in the war isn't extended as negotiations continue over starting a second phase. The Houthis had described their warning as taking hold in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden, the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the Arabian Sea. The Houthis targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors, during their campaign targeting military and civilian ships between the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in late 2023 and January of this year, when a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza took effect. The attacks raised the Houthis' profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen's decade-long stalemated war that's torn apart the Arab world's poorest nation. The Houthi media office said the U.S. strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Sanaa's northern district of Shouab. Sanaa residents said at least four airstrikes rocked the Eastern Geraf neighborhood in Shouab district, terrifying women and children in the area. The explosions were very strong, said Abdallah al-Alffi. It was like an earthquake. The United States, Israel and Britain have previously hit Houthi-held areas in Yemen. Israel's military declined to comment. Saturday's operation against the Houthis was conducted solely by the U.S., according to a U.S. official. It was the first strike on the Yemen-based Houthis under the second Trump administration, and it comes after a period of relative quiet in the region. Such broad-based and pre-planned missile strikes against the Houthis were done multiple times by the Biden administration in response to frequent attacks by the Houthis against commercial and military vessels in the region. The USS Harry S. Truman carrier strike group, which includes the carrier, three Navy destroyers and one cruiser, are in the Red Sea and were part of the mission. The USS Georgia cruise missile submarine has also been operating in the region. Trump announced the strikes as he spent the day at his Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida. These relentless assaults have cost the U.S. and World Economy many BILLIONS of Dollars while, at the same time, putting innocent lives at risk, Trump said.

Glow Vallejo painted the town red — well, red, blue, green and purple and blue, for that matter — with a colorful display of fire shows and intricate mixed media from Vallejo's very own Obtainium Works that was truly a sight to behold on Saturday. Most notable perhaps was San Francisco-based Flaming Lotus Girls with their intricate fire-spewing displays. The women-led art collective known for their slightly dangerous but absolutely stunning works brought some much-needed light to Downtown Vallejo. They brought two parts of their Angel of the Apocalypse sculpture. As a symbol of rebirth and transformation, the 12-foot-tall stainless steel wings erupted with participant-activated flames. We love to share our art, said Flaming Lotus Girls' Caroline Mills Miller. It's part of our passion. As she described, one of their favorite aspects of attending live events is how the displays open up a conversation with people, allowing them to explain that creating art is actually quite easy. The interactive piece invites attendees to press two buttons emitting a poof of fire —as they like to call it — in between its tall steel towers. A big part of their mission is to encourage everybody to make art, said Miller. I think it develops community and allows everybody to come together to have an enjoyable moment in the times of strife. People fire off part of The Angel of the Apocalypse metal sculpture created by The Flaming Lotus Girls during Glow Vallejo in downtown on Friday. (Chris Riley/Times-Herald) Pop and Reggaeton beats also filled the air, courtesy of DJ Lando Uno and DJ Strategy, which kept the vibes light and energetic. Vallejo puts on a good party, said resident Keri Aiani. I'm happy to be here to support the community. Vallejo-based Artist Kacie Janae of ​​Prizmatik Artz showcased her talent through striking black light face paint. Attendees of all ages lined up for a chance to be on the other side of Janae's brush, watching as the talented artist led a tutorial on how to paint a jellyfish. As a celebration of community and creativity, Glow Vallejo was made possible through the help of event planning organization Event Wonder and the City of Vallejo — featuring a handful of Vallejo's talented artists and tinkerers as Obtainium Works likes to say. Designed by Cheryl Fralick, the propane-powered Dragon Wagon was among the list of creative works. The interactive piece, fabricated by women welders, allowed participants to control the fire spewing from its mouth and tail. I think it's a great way to show some of our local art pieces, said Kathy O'Hare of Obtainium Works. It's also kind of fun because it will expand out the art walk itself. Both Georgia and Marin streets were a stunning ode to the city's creative thinkers. I think sometimes Vallejo gets a bad rap but if people come down to the downtown area and enjoy what we have to offer, said Vallejoan Lisa Bolina. You see how vibrant a community it can be. With the help of event designing company Suite Treatments, the city was able to decorate the streets with over 120 light-up fixtures and fire-breathing machinery. Inspired by Napa's Lighted Art Festival, founder Jacqueline Wonder wanted to bring that same energy to Vallejo. Art is the heart of Vallejo, said Wonder. But in order to have a really good art walk, you need to have a curated event. Her hope is Glow Vallejo is a glimpse into what a curated event can look like. Next year we'd like to do it in January for the whole weekend, she said. In the future, she hopes to make the event an annual celebration of art, one that gradually grows in size as the city does.|2025-03-16|https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2025/03/15/glow-vallejo-downtown-serves-as-a-stunning-ode-to-the-citys-creative-thinkers/
The Suisun City Council will discuss next steps in its process of considering annexation of land currently owned by controversial developers California Forever when it meets Tuesday. In January, the council voted 4-1 to also explore annexation in the city's sphere of influence in order to generate revenue and housing. The area in question includes land owned by controversial development firm California Forever. City Manager Bret Prebula said at the time that infill housing, such as that outlined in the plan, can be part of the solution to Suisun's housing woes, but cannot be enough to solve the issue on its own. Growth provides a level of expectation that our residents feel they will forever not be tax increased over time just to save the services of the city, he said. The City's General Fund budget stands at $29 million, with an estimated additional $15.6 million needed to provide fully funded services for a community of 30,000 residents, a staff report included with Tuesday's agenda explains. Additionally, infrastructure and facility improvements will require an additional $70–$80 million in funding over the next decade. Infill development at best, over the next 6 to 10 years would bring in $4 million to $5 million on the high end, thus evaluating the expansion of Suisun City's borders is required to determine if a level of growth can be achieved to both address current service demand gaps while providing high level service and capital savings for any annexed land into city limits. Staff is asking approval for taking next steps in the process which would include approving formal outreach to property owners within the targeted annexation areas. The council will review and consider approval of draft letters at the meeting. The next steps would also include reorganization of the Economic Development Advisory Committee to engage in the annexation and infill discussion. The council meets at 6:30 p.m. in the City Council Chambers, 701 Civic Center Boulevard.|2025-03-16|https://www.timesheraldonline.com/2025/03/15/suisun-council-to-consider-next-steps-in-annexation-process/
Rodgers spent the first 18 seasons of his 20-year NFL career with the Vikings NFC North Division rival Green Bay Packers and has a 17-12-1 record against the franchise. The four-time MVP spent the past two seasons with the New York Jets prior to the team's decision to move on from him earlier this month, though he is still signed through 2025. Last week we met with Aaron and shared that our intention was to move in a different direction at quarterback, said newly hired head coach Aaron Glenn and general manager Darren Mougey in a statement released on the Jets' official website. It was important to have this discussion now to provide clarity and enable each of us the proper time to plan for our respective futures. We want to thank him for the leadership, passion, and dedication he brought to the organization and wish him success moving forward. I personally want to thank Aaron for his time at the New York Jets, said Chairman Woody Johnson. His arrival in 2023 was met with unbridled excitement and I will forever be grateful that he chose to join us to continue his Hall of Fame career. From day one, he embodied all that it meant to be a New York Jet, embraced our fans, and immersed himself in our city. That is what I will remember most when I look back at his time here. He will always be welcome, and I wish him only the best in whatever he chooses to do next. Rodgers was acquired in a trade with the Packers in 2023 and pegged to be the missing piece for a Jets team that hadn't made a postseason appearance since 2010.

FBI warns Gmail, Outlook users about phishing campaigns, ransomware attacks Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, tech and others this year. More Videos / Example video title will go here for this video LOS ANGELES — The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are warning against a dangerous ransomware scheme. In an advisory posted earlier this week, government officials warned that a ransomware-as-a-service software called Medusa, which has launched ransomware attacks since 2021, has recently affected hundreds of people. Medusa uses phishing campaigns as its main method for stealing victims' credentials, according to CISA. To protect against the ransomware, officials recommended patching operating systems, software and firmware, in addition to using multifactor authentication for all services such as email and VPNs. Experts also recommended using long passwords, and warned against frequently recurring password changes because they can weaken security. Medusa developers and affiliates — called Medusa actors — use a double extortion model, where they encrypt victim data and threaten to publicly release exfiltrated data if a ransom is not paid, the advisory said. Medusa operates a data-leak site that shows victims alongside countdowns to the release of information. Ransom demands are posted on the site, with direct hyperlinks to Medusa affiliated cryptocurrency wallets, the advisory said. At this stage, Medusa concurrently advertises sale of the data to interested parties before the countdown timer ends. Victims can additionally pay $10,000 USD in cryptocurrency to add a day to the countdown timer. Since February, Medusa developers and affiliates have hit more than 300 victims across industries, including the medical, education, legal, insurance, technology and manufacturing sectors, CISA said.|2025-03-16|https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/nation-world/fbi-warning-against-ransomware-emails/507-32ce7292-d403-4009-99a1-5bd048c56d13
An appeal challenging the San Diego Planning Commission's approval of a proposed five-home development on La Jolla's Foxhill property has been withdrawn just ahead of when it was to be heard by the City Council. The appellant, Chris Connolly, who lives next to the site in the Country Club area, did not comment to the La Jolla Light about the reasons for the withdrawal. The appeal, filed last year, hoped to slow the project to build five three-story single-family homes ranging from 8,493 to 13,544 square feet on the storied hilltop property on Country Club Drive once owned by the Copley family and developer Doug Manchester, both former owners of The San Diego Union-Tribune. The new houses would be adjacent to the existing Foxhill mansion, which would not be affected by the plans. The property owner, investment group Foxhill Invco One LLC, bought the entire 32 acres for $35 million last spring. Each new home likely would have five bedrooms, a basement, a pool and an outdoor living space. The smallest lot is 19,000 square feet; the four others are more than 30,000 square feet. A similar plan was presented to the La Jolla Development Permit Review Committee last March, but Foxhill Invco did not go back to that committee or the La Jolla Community Planning Association, instead proceeding directly to the city. The project got the Planning Commission's unanimous support in September. Staff has … determined the project is in conformance with the policies and regulations of the Land Development Code, General Plan and the Community Plan, Renee Mezo, the San Diego Development Services Department's assistant deputy director, and Robin MacCartee, development project manager, wrote in a report. Connolly had contended the project was proceeding without adequate input from affected neighbors or consideration of La Jolla's character and potential environmental impacts. The developers are not engaging with the community and planning groups but they are going forward, Connolly said at the time of his appeal. It would be great to have a community dialogue with the developer and reach a compromise. We want to make sure the new development is in line with the Community Plan. Those concerns were shared by others who live in the area. Most seriously, in my opinion, is a traffic and transportation impact affecting the safety of a large group of La Jolla residents, Tom Fetter told the Light. This aspect of the proposed development bypassed the consideration of the La Jolla transportation and traffic subcommittee. … Most of the roadways in this specific area were constructed in the 1920s and are narrow with only one lane of passage if there are cars parked in front of the homes. The Planning Commission's decision should be overturned and a thorough review of this issue should be undertaken. In October, the DPR Committee voted unanimously to write a letter to Foxhill Invco, the Planning Commission, Planning Department and City Council requesting further local review of the project. I think it is appropriate for the community to take another look at this, DPR trustee Angeles Leira said at the time. She argued that there is a process involving local review in addition to the city and said she wanted a full presentation of what they are planning to do and the impact. However, Connolly, after conferring with the applicant team, withdrew his appeal before it could be heard by the City Council this week. The city has a series of development levels — known as processes — based on a project's intensity and potential impact. Appeals may be filed only for Process 2 and above. The cost to file an appeal is $1,000, and it must be filed within 10 business days of the decision. In general, Process 2 (staff) and 3 (hearing officer) decisions are appealable to the Planning Commission, though in some cases they may be appealed directly to the City Council. Additionally, Process 4 [Planning Commission] and [capital improvement projects] decisions are appealable to the San Diego City Council, according to the city. Anyone may appeal a Process 2 decision, but only those who qualify as interested persons or applicants under the Municipal Code can appeal a Process 3 or 4 decision. Interested person means a person who spoke at a public hearing from which an appeal arose or a person who expressed an interest in the decision in writing to that decision-maker before the close of the public hearing, the Municipal Code states.

Another day, another password breach. This time, the compromised website belongs to the Plex media-streaming service, and the advice is predictable: Reset your account password immediately. Yes, of course you should do that. But don't stop there. Every one of these incidents is an opportunity to assess your current online security and tighten it up as needed. The goal is to make sure you're at minimal risk when (not if) another, similar data breach occurs. The best way to do that is to follow three ironclad rules: Always use a long, random password Never reuse a password Always turn on 2-factor authentication (2FA), if possible If you followed those rules, you wouldn't have been particularly worried about today's password breach. Why? The hash of that long, random password can't easily be matched with its plaintext version, and even if the thieves managed to decrypt that password and try to use it before you changed it, they'd be stopped cold by the 2FA prompt. Most importantly, if they tried those credentials on other sites, they'd have no success at all. The real danger of reusing passwords is that simply changing them in one place isn't enough. If you use the same password on multiple websites, you could be in a heap of trouble once the bad guys start trying the stolen Plex password on popular sites like Gmail and Outlook.com. The good news is that a first-rate password manager can help you identify weak passwords and detect duplicates. Here's one example, a report generated by 1Password using its Watchtower feature: That's an excellent starting point for getting your passwords in order. And don't feel bad if the numbers seem alarmingly high. If you imported a collection of older passwords when you set up your password manager, then you're undoubtedly dealing with a collection of credentials you created yourself. Because human beings are notoriously bad at creating truly random strings of text, those passwords are probably weak, which means they can be easily guessed or are vulnerable to a brute-force attack. A weak password is typically too short, is made up of words that can be found in a dictionary, and/or contains all or part of the account name. Even if you did manage to create a truly random, hard-to-guess password, your password manager will flag it if it determines you've used that password at multiple sites. The good news is that every modern password manager also contains a password generator, which you can use to replace those old, weak, insecure passwords. Here's what the password generator in 1Password looks like: One thing I love about 1Password's generator is that it offers the option to create memorable passwords, like whinny-upswept-inferior-apiary, as an alternative to random strings of alphanumeric gibberish like TouB4kccX_kF7csPW9f9. Unfortunately, the process of changing your old passwords is labor-intensive. For each service, you'll need to find the page where you change your password; use the password generator to create a new, random, unique password and then update the saved entry. As a best practice, you should do this as soon as possible for high-value sites like banks, credit card portals, and email and social media accounts. After completing each password change, I recommend that you immediately sign out of the service and sign in again, using your freshly saved password, to confirm that the new password was properly stored. The final step is to ensure that you turn on 2-factor authentication wherever you can. You should absolutely turn on this protection for high-value sites like email services and financial institutions. Your mobile phone is the best 2FA device, ideally with an authenticator app rather than SMS messages. Just make sure you've got a good backup for your 2FA credentials in case your phone is lost or stolen. For the most part, finding out which authentication methods are available for a specific site usually requires signing in and then poking around the account options section. Look for anything with the words login or security. Not sure whether a service supports additional authentication options? Check out the excellent 2FA Directory, an open-source project that maintains an exhaustive list of websites, with details on whether and how they support 2FA. If your service isn't measuring up, and switching is an option, this is definitely the place to start.|2025-03-16|https://www.zdnet.com/article/caught-up-in-another-password-breach-follow-these-3-rules-to-protect-yourself-online/

Speaking at the formation day celebrations at the party office here, he said the YSRCP took birth out of struggle and remarked that fighting against injustice was not new to it. He mentioned that out of 15 years since the formation of the party, it was in the opposition for 10 years and it had been fighting for people. The party was in opposition for 10 years and it highlighted the failures of the governments. Sitting in the opposition is not new, he said. Jagan, whose party lost power to the TDP-led alliance last year, exuded confidence that in the next elections, YSRCP would return to power. Thanking the cadre for the support throughout the journey, Jagan Mohan Reddy pointed out that on the formation day, the YSRCP was also protesting against the coalition government's failure to clear the fees reimbursement dues, causing hardships to students. The former chief minister stated that the coalition government had to clear Vidaya Devena and Vidya Vasathi amount to the tune of Rs Rs 7,100 crore for two years but it was neglecting it. He said the government allocated a meagre Rs 2,600 crore putting the students' careers in jeopardy. YSRCP being the voice of the people has taken up the issue along with students and parents on party formation day, he said. The YSRCP chief alleged that the coalition government failed on all fronts. Farmers, women, youth and all sections feel cheated as the Super Six promises made during elections are not being honoured. Education, health, agriculture and governance have been badly affected during the past 10 months, he said. Jagan said, unlike the coalition, the YSRCP cadre can proudly go to any house and they would be welcomed as their government delivered welfare to every household in a transparent manner, adhering to the welfare calendar. Earlier, Jagan Mohan Reddy paid floral tributes to Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy and hoisted the party flag. He said YSRCP was formed to take forward the welfare agenda of Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy. He thanked the cadre who lent support to the party during this 15-year-long journey. He stated that YSRCP which began its journey with him saw many ups and downs but marched ahead undeterred. After assuming power, we have welfare and development agenda like no other state had done in the country and improved the standard of living of the people, maintaining a sustainable economic development, he posted on X. Claiming that YSRCP fulfilled all its poll promises, Jagan said it was synonymous with credibility.|2025-03-16|https://www.newkerala.com/news/o/ysrcp-voice-voiceless-says-jagan-party-formation-day-245
With egg prices high, U.S. border officials report a sharp increase in smuggling attempts from Mexico and Canada. Customs and Border Protection has recorded a 158% rise in intercepted egg shipments at its San Diego field office since last year, The Wall Street Journal reported. At the El Paso border station in Texas, CBP identified more than 90 people attempting to import raw eggs from Mexico between January and February. Similarly, officials at the Detroit-Windsor crossing at the Canadian border reported a 36% increase in interceptions of eggs compared to the previous year. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

NEW YORK (AP) — If it's March, and it's green, it must be St. Patrick's Day. The day honoring the patron saint of Ireland is a global celebration of Irish heritage. And nowhere is that more so than in the United States, where parades take place in cities around the country and all kinds of foods and drinks are given an emerald hue. In fact, it was among Irish American communities that the day became the celebration it is, from its roots as a more solemn day with a religious observance in Ireland. But even in America, it was about more than a chance to dye a river green (looking at you, Chicago) or just bust out a favorite piece of green clothing, it was about putting down roots and claiming a piece of the country's calendar. Who is St. Patrick and why does he even have a day? Patrick was not actually Irish, according to experts. Born in the late fourth century, he was captured as an adolescent and ended up enslaved in Ireland. He escaped to another part of Europe where he was trained as a priest and returned to Ireland in the fifth century to promote the spread of Christianity. Several centuries later, he was made a saint by the Catholic Church and like other saints had a day dedicated to him, which was March 17. He became Ireland's patron saint, and even when religious strife broke out between Catholics and Protestants, was claimed by both, says Mike Cronin, historian and academic director of Boston College Dublin. How did an Irish saint's day become an American thing? The short answer: Irish people came to America and brought their culture with them. St. Patrick's Day observances date back to before the founding of the U.S., in places like Boston and New York City. The first parade was held in Manhattan in 1762. While the day was marked with more of a religious framing and solemnity in Ireland until well into the 20th century, in America it became the cultural and boisterous celebration it is today, marked by plenty of people without a trace of Irish heritage. It was because people in Ireland started seeing how the day was marked in the U.S. that it became more of a festival in the country of its origin rather than strictly a religious observance, Cronin says, pointing to the parades, parties and other festivities that are held. Oh, and by the way, for those who like to shorten names: Use St. Paddy's Day, not St. Patty's Day. Paddy is a nickname for Pádraig, which is the Irish spelling of Patrick. Featured Local Savings Why is it such a big deal? Holidays aren't simply days to watch bands go by, or wear a specific outfit or costume. Being able to mark a holiday, and have others mark it, is a way of putting down roots, showing that you've made it in American culture, says Leigh Schmidt, professor in the Danforth Center on Religion and Politics at Washington University. You've made your claim on that American calendar, in American civic life, by having these holidays widely recognized. The spread of St. Patrick's Day celebrations in the U.S. was a way for Irish immigrant communities, who in the 19th century faced discrimination and opposition, to stake that ground, he says: It's a kind of immigrant Irish way of combating nativist antagonism against them. What's with four-leaf clovers, anyway? A popular sight around the holiday is the shamrock, or three-leaf clover, linked to Ireland and St. Patrick. The lucky ones, though, come across something that's harder to find: a four-leaf clover. That's because it takes a recessive trait or traits in the clover's genetics for there to be more than the normal 3 leaves, says Vincent Pennetti, who has been fascinated by the plants since high school. Four-leaf clovers are real. They are rare, he says. That doesn't mean they can't be found. People just have to keep their eyes open and get really good at noticing patterns and breaks in the patterns, and they just start jumping out at you, he says. Katie Glerum finds them. She says it's not unheard of for her to be somewhere like out in a park and see one. She usually scoops it up and often gives it to someone else, to a positive response. If it happened every day, then I probably would be less excited about it, she says. But yeah, when it happens, it is exciting.|2025-03-16|https://gazette.com/ap/lifestyles/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-st-patricks-day/article_ae704f6d-aa70-548b-84ca-f7a1d8defc20.html

The dueling tariffs between Canada and the United States are a concern to South Dakota because of its proximity to the northern country, but farmer and ranchers have faith in President Donald Trump's decisions, new South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden said on Newsmax Saturday. I think the farmers and ranchers in South Dakota recognize that Donald Trump is a New York real estate guy, and he understands the art of the negotiation, the Republican governor, who took office after former Gov. Kristi Noem became the Homeland Security Secretary under Trump, told Newsmax's Saturday Agenda. South Dakota is very dramatically an agricultural state, Rhoden added, and it has a good working relationship with the Trump administration. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

MERLIN, Ore. -- As wildfire season approaches, homeowners are clearing debris with burn piles, but they can quickly get out of control. Rural Metro Fire is offering tips on safe burning practices. They recommend starting with a small pile, typically around 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. You can add more debris as the fire burns down, but it's important to keep the pile under control and clear of nearby hazards. The main goal is to protect yourself and prevent the spread of wildfires. Keeping your pile safe protects your property, your neighbors, and the community, Teague explained. Before lighting the pile, make sure to clear the ground around it. Wet piles should be covered to reduce smoke and help them burn cleaner. It's also important to have safety tools on hand, like a garden hose, shovels, and rakes, to quickly address any fire that may escape the pile's perimeter. Weather plays a big role in safely managing a burn pile. The best conditions are cool, rainy days with higher humidity. Dry or windy conditions can cause the fire to escape, so avoid burning on such days. Windy days can push the fire away from the pile, and embers can spread into dry grass, Teague warned. Burn piles should also be kept clear of buildings, fences, and trees, which could catch fire and make the situation worse. A major cause of out-of-control fires is unattended piles. Rural Metro Fire responds to many burn piles that escape, especially in the early stages of fire season when the weather starts to dry out. It can take just minutes for the fire to get out of control, Teague said. If you leave the pile unattended, even for a short time, it can quickly spread, especially if wind picks up. The most important step after burning is ensuring the fire is completely out. Make sure the pile is extinguished with no hot spots remaining, Teague emphasized. It's also a good idea to have your cell phone with you in case you need to call 911 quickly. Don't run back to your house to grab your phone—have it with you so you can get help immediately if needed. Conducting a burn reduces fire hazards on your property, preventing it from becoming fuel later in the season. It also avoids the cost and hassle of hauling debris to a recycling center. Burning it off is an easy way to clean up and reduce the risk of a bigger fire later, Teague added. By following these safety tips and staying alert, homeowners can safely prepare for wildfire season while keeping their property and community safe.|2025-03-16|https://www.kdrv.com/news/safe-burn-pile-practices-to-prepare-for-wildfire-season/article_8fa6975c-01f1-11f0-8831-23fe1ee1664f.html

Kelli Yugsi was ready for the St. Patrick Society's Grand Parade XXXIX. Dressed as a leprechaun, Yugsi, nee McGee, was bundled up against the cold, except for the tiny green leprechaun hat she wore on her head. This hat is doing nothing to keep me warm, she said with a laugh. Standing with her mother and the rest of the family on Rock Island's 4th Avenue, Yugsi said that her aunt, Amy Rogers Murphy, is this year's Irish Mother of the Year. My grandmother, Arlene Murphy, was Irish Mother of the Year in 1994, she said. The annual parade is a tradition for the family, Yugsi said. We've been to every parade, even before grandma was Irish Mother. With a steady wind blowing at 24 mph, and sometimes gusting to as high as 32 mph, Saturday's weather for the parade was a far cry from the high of 82 degrees on Friday. With the temperature at 46 degrees at parade time, according to the National Weather Service, Davenport, the wind made it feel like 38 degrees. The weather is perfect, said Joe Dooley, President of the St. Patrick Society of the Quad Cities, as he prepared to march. Two years ago, it was 12 degrees. While the parade route for the only bi-state St. Patrick's Day parade was packed with people, many were bundled up in blankets. Starting in Rock Island, the parade made its way over the Stanley Talbot Memorial (Centennial) Bridge into Davenport to end at the RiverCenter. Kelley Klingerman, decked out with green streamers in her hair, said she and her family have only missed two parades since it began. The colder weather was no deterrent. I live an hour away, and every year we make the hike, Klingerman said. My son and daughter-in-law and my granddaughter used to live in Minnesota, and they'd drive down every year. They now live in East Moline so when my granddaughter grows up, if they keep having the parade, she can bring her kids.|2025-03-16|https://muscatinejournal.com/news/local/article_42621c4c-df88-5859-9d1b-06e0ff9bed85.html
President Trump said the United States has launched decisive and powerful strikes against Houthi militants in Yemen, warning that the military will use overwhelming lethal force until the Iran-backed rebels stop their attacks on cargo ships and free up shipping lanes in the region. Trump wrote that the aerial attacks targeted Houthi bases, leaders and missile defense systems to protect American shipping, air, and naval assets and to restore Navigational Freedom, No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the Waterways of the World, Trump said in a Saturday post on Truth Social. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The attacks were carried out by Air Force attack jets and armed drones that took off from various bases in the region, along with fighter planes from the Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, a source familiar with the matter told The Hill. The source added that this is not a one-day event. This is the first of many days if not weeks of strikes. The Houthis have choked off shipping in one of the most important Waterways of the World, grinding vast swaths of Global Commerce to a halt, and attacking the core principle of Freedom of Navigation upon which International Trade and Commerce depends, the president said. In late January, Trump signed an executive order directing his administration to redesignate Houthis in Yemen as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO), pointing to the group's attacks on commercial vessels, U.S. Navy ships and civilian infrastructure in the Middle East. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The Saturday attack also damaged several residential buildings in the Sha'ub district, north of Yemen's capital Sanaa, the Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported. On Tuesday, the Iran-backed group said it will resume attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Arabian and Red seas, the Gulf of Aden and Bab al-Mandab Strait, warning that if any vessel breaches the group's ban on the passage of all Israeli ships, it will become a target. The Houthis will keep it up until the crossings to the Gaza Strip are reopened and aid, food, and medicine are allowed in. Israel paused aid flowing into the war-torn Gaza Strip earlier this month. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Since Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, which ignited the war in the region, the Houthis have shot at ships with drones and missiles. The U.K., U.S. and Israel retaliated against the Houthis several times last year, with the U.S. striking 15 targets in early October last year. Trump warned the Houthis on Saturday that their attacks on cargo ships have to stop or HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! The Saturday attacks represented the first confirmed U.S. strikes against the Iran-backed group since Trump took office in January. The commander-in-chief also cautioned Iran, who he told to begin fresh negotiations regarding a new nuclear deal, that Tehran's support for the Houthis must end IMMEDIATELY! Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Do NOT threaten the American People, their President, who has received one of the largest mandates in Presidential History, or Worldwide shipping lanes, Trump said. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable and, we won't be nice about it!|2025-03-16|https://www.yahoo.com/news/us-launches-decisive-powerful-strikes-204506323.html
SANTA FE, N.M. (KRQE) – Santa Fe Public Schools is searching for a new superintendent and wants the community's input on their possible selection.

Prime Minister Dr Andrew Holness has responded sharply to former Prime Minister P J Patterson for his recent scathing assessment of the present government's stewardship of the country's affairs. Last month Mr Patterson, in his address at the People's National Party Region Six Forum said the administration of Dr Holness's Jamaica Labour Party [JLP] had done a poor job at managing the country's road network, health system and reducing poverty. But, Dr Holness, speaking in the constituency of St. Elizabeth North West, on Friday night, declared that his administration had raised the bar in creating better policies that benefit the majority. Furthermore, he said says the former Prime Minister was in no position to criticise the government. Third Term? Dr Holness also declared that the governing JLP has earned a third term in office, claiming that it has accomplished all that it had set out to do. The Prime Minister, conceded, however, that the JLP is not entitled to the votes of Jamaicans but must win them over through action. Asserting that the JLP should be given the opportunity to continue with the management of the country, Dr Holness said the party will be launching a voter awareness campaign, especially targeting young people, whom he argues are being misled by the People's National Party.|2025-03-16|https://radiojamaicanewsonline.com/local/patterson-in-no-position-to-criticise-the-government-says-holness

More than a week after three masked suspects opened fire during its opening night and injured 12 people, a Scarborough pub has released a statement, saying it is heartbroken by what happened and is cooperating with the investigation. Piper Arms – Scarborough Town Centre posted the statement on its Instagram page on Saturday. We are heartbroken over what happened at our Scarborough Town Centre location on what was supposed to be a special opening night for our team and the community, the pub wrote. The safety of our guests and staff remains our top priority. We are cooperating fully with authorities as they investigate, and we are relieved that no lives were lost. The pub also condemned the incident in its statement. This kind of violence has no place in our community, Piper Arms said, adding that the pub has always been about bringing people together. We are grateful for the support of our customers, staff and neighbours during this difficult time. We appreciate the trust you've placed in us and remain dedicated to serving our community with the same hospitality and care that define us. Toronto police have not made any arrests in the March 7 mass shooting at Piper Arms on Progress Avenue. They have not released descriptions of the three suspects, who they said entered the pub with an assault rifle and two handguns. The suspects opened fire indiscriminately, hitting seven people, police said. Five others were injured by flying glass. All 12 victims survived. The shooting also left the newly renovated pub riddled with bullet holes, which became embedded in windows, drywall, and a flat-screen TV. The last update on the shooting came on Tuesday when police released a statement in which they said investigators were working around the clock to find the suspects. Officers have been working around the clock – gathering evidence, speaking with witnesses and pursuing every lead to identify and locate those responsible, the statement read. Police added that updates would be provided as soon as it is appropriate to do so.|2025-03-16|https://www.cp24.com/news/2025/03/15/heartbroken-piper-arms-pub-releases-statement-about-shooting-that-injured-12-people/
Jazz • Late Night • Music For decades, David Basse has been at the forefront of the music scene in Kansas City, taking the torch from such legends as KC Jazz pioneers Charlie Parker, Count Basie and Jay McShann. A jazz drummer and vocalist since the 1970s, David's singing has been compared to Mel Tormé, Jon Hendricks and Al Jarreau. Other reviewers hear elements of Ray Charles and Dr. John. Whatever listeners hear, they respond enthusiastically. David and his band, The City Light Orchestra, have been featured on Wolf Trap and All That Jazz and played at the 1997 Inaugural Gala for President Clinton. If you have tickets to the Kansas City Chiefs, you can often hear David's rendition of Strike When the Iron Is Hot used to fire up the crowds. David came to radio in 1999, stepping behind the microphone for KKFI-FM in Kansas City. When Kansas Public Radio was looking for a host to take over The Jazz Scene, David's insight and background made him a natural choice. He has hosted the show since 2001, winning a Kansas Association of Broadcasters award along the way, while KPR's jazz department won a JazzWeek award for Best Jazz Station – Small Market. His latest venture is the nationally-syndicated radio show Jazz with David Basse, where he curates and hosts 15 hours of jazz every week, offering up the depth and breadth of jazz along with snippets of interviews with artists, anecdotes and insights from his decades-long experience in the world of jazz. In addition, David shares his deep knowledge of jazz as an instructor at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Swing University.|2025-03-16|https://kkfi.org/program/jazz-with-david-basse/
California homeowners are facing a 22% increase in insurance premiums if State Farm, the state's largest single insurer with roughly 1 million home insurance policies in California, can justify it with data in a public hearing next month, California's top insurance regulator said Friday, reports the Los Angeles Times. State Farm claims it is committed to its California customers and aims to restore financial stability. I expect both State Farm and its parent company to meet their responsibilities and not shift the burden entirely onto their customers, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara said in a statement. The facts will be revealed in an open, transparent hearing. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's New South Wales on Sunday sweated in a heat wave that raised the risk of bushfires and prompted authorities to issue a total fire ban for state capital Sydney. New South Wales, coming to the end of a high risk bushfire season that runs until the end of March, was a focus of a catastrophic 2019-2020 Black Summer of wildfires that destroyed an area the size of Turkey and killed 33 people. On Sunday, the nation's weather forecaster said temperatures would be up to 12 degrees Celsius (21.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above average in some areas of the state, with temperatures in Sydney, Australia's most populous city, set to hit 37C (98.6F). At Sydney Airport, the temperature was already 29.3C (84.7 F) at 9:30 a.m. local time, more than three degrees above the March mean maximum temperature, according to forecaster data. Gusty winds, hot conditions and low relative humidity will result in extreme fire danger over the greater Sydney region, the forecaster said on its website. The state's Rural Fire Service said on X that a total fire ban was in place for large swaths of the state including Sydney due to the forecast of hot, dry and windy conditions . In neighbouring Victoria state, a home was destroyed in a bushfire on the outskirts of Melbourne that was being battled by around 200 firefighters, Country Fire Authority official Bernard Barbetti told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Sunday. Climate change is causing extreme heat and fire weather to become more common in Australia, a bushfire-prone country of around 27 million, the country's science agency said last year.

Grab your Holy Bible and rosary beads as we look at ten essential demonic horror movies that will send shivers down your spine… As Flickering Myth takes a leap into independent film with The Baby in the Basket, our own little slice of demonic horror (releasing on DVD and Digital this February!), maybe now is a good time to look at some essential demonic horror films! With possessed kids, cults, witch covens, pins-a-plenty and more, here are ten essential demonic horror movies… Hellraiser Clive Barker's iconic sadomasochistic fantasy horror did something that felt truly unique. The infamous puzzle box can unlock a doorway to hell where demonic cenobites await to tear your soul apart. Grotesque visuals, body horror and a grimy psychosexual tale of obsession and fascination with the dark arts. It wasn't entirely intentional, but the iconic Pinhead seemed destined to become a classic horror villain with his unforgettable look, covering Doug Bradley's face in pins. He's not actually in the original film that much, but the studio quickly realised he would be the inevitable poster boy. Barker's lack of directorial experience gave him a naivety to film-making processes and budget consciousness that ended up benefiting the film with little consideration that things couldn't be achieved, or might not work. The striking lighting, gruesome images and style certainly helped to make Hellraiser so memorable whilst the sultry Clare Higgins has a distinctly fascinating and complex female character in a genre that was normally preoccupied with eye candy and/or the final girl archetype. The villains have always been infinitely more fascinating than the protagonists in this franchise. Rosemary's Baby Roman Polanski brought a run of intense and enthralling psychological horrors to a close with Rosemary's Baby (following the likes of Repulsion). What has become a fascinating allegory for gaslighting was probably not intended as quite such back in 1968. Rosemary falls pregnant but is struck by a growing paranoia that something is not right about her unborn child and that some of her neighbours are up to something. Polanski was a master of creating engaging and tense cinema from minimalist settings and on the strength of a single performer tasked with carrying large stretches of the picture alone on screen. Mia Farrow manages to do just that with a sensational performance. The use of long takes and meticulous blocking makes the film feel immersive and it's a triumph of atmosphere over cheap scares. The Omen You adopt a young kid and all is good in the world. Just one problem, he might just be the son of the devil. The infamous Damien, the antichrist and little harbinger of doom basically cursed all name sakes after 1976 to having the Mickey royally taken out of them. Richard Donner's slow-burning and unnerving horror is full of so many unforgettable moments from the first iconic tricycle riding moment in horror cinema to the savagely brutal, but impeccably timed death sequences. Gregory Peck is the weary Ambassador who made a grave error of judgment after his wife's child was stillborn when he paid off a new mother to take a child to raise as he and his wife's own. Donner delivers the horror with the same kind of precise aplomb that he always did with action set pieces. Timed to perfection. Everything builds to an enthralling and dark finale, the kind which exemplified a darker era in American cinema. The Exorcist A film that went down in infamy and took horror from being a niche audience to being mainstream. The massive hit became notorious for leaving audiences screaming, fainting and allegedly dying in theatres. Eventually, the mythology about the film's terror and cursed set probably ran away into near fantasy. That's not to say William Friedkin's rumination on faith doesn't live up to its reputation. It's still genuinely unnerving, superbly acted and expertly put together. Max von Sydow and Jason Miller are great as the two priests with differing perspectives on faith but Linda Blair, so young at the time of filming, really does steal the show. Though rotating heads, projectile vomiting and demonic possession potty mouth have been mercilessly spoofed, The Exorcist is still essential horror. All the constant sequels, reboots and ripoffs, less so (bar the underrated third film). The Wailing The Wailing is a superb Korean horror film that blooms slowly but unsettles deeply. Born of folk tales and paying homage to a classic period of East Asian horror cinema where folk stories were the order of the day, this sees a remote village beset by gruesome murders, believing the town has been cursed by a visitor from Japan who may be a demon, evil spirit or practitioner of witchcraft or black magic. There's an interesting element to the way the outsider, the foreigner is viewed here, as well as dealing with generational views on superstition and folklore. The film has plenty of twists and turns, as well as lingering tension and an atmosphere that always threatens to unnerve you. Japanese icon Jun Kunimura adds plenty of gravitas and Kwak Do-Wan is also superb. Na Hong-jin is typically assured as director and this is one of the best horror films of recent times. The Witch The film which bought Robert Eggers to the forefront of Indie horror and also solidified the mesmerising talent of Anya Taylor-Joy. A minimalist, stark, atmospheric and disturbing folk take where a belligerent father settles his family into a land that progressively appears to be barren and cursed. Banished, poor and increasingly unable to fend for themselves, strange things begin happening with a visit from a Witch, the puritan family fall apart under crisis of faith and the influence of demonic forces. Eggers' film set the tone for a filmmaker able to craft engaging, visually driven stories with complex ideas, visual assurance and a committed cast. Some found the film lacking in horror spectacle, but this is definitely not lacking in unforgettable and disturbing moments. Evil Dead 2 Sam Raimi's career-defining sequel to the original classic. Evil Dead II is a reboot/sequel fusion that has more lavish production values than the original but still retains the charm of ultra-low-budget productions. Raimi's former muse, Bruce Campbell is the epitome of the charming and chiselled hero, with an ability to perform Buster Keaton-esque feats of physical comedy. Evil Dead 2 is a perfect blend of comedy and horror, packaged with ingenuity and glorious style thanks to Raimi's dynamic shots and editing. That we're still going with the Necronomicon and its hell portal-opening antics, is a testament to how great the first two films were. Demons Lamberto Bava's comedic and madcap horror classic is a brilliant ode to horror cinema as the chaos of the genre spills out of the screen to unsuspecting horror fans. A dash of meta but this is mostly concerned with entertaining an audience and providing them with plenty of practical blood and carnage. The viewers are trapped in the movie theatre as demons begin to pick off the audience to feed on them. The film's whimsy and joyous practical effects work make it a light but thoroughly enjoyable comedy horror. The Entity One of the more underrated gems of early 80s horror sees Barbara Hershey as a mother tormented and raped by a demonic force, apparently based loosely on a true story. What could have been a cheesy and misjudged film, is adeptly handled by veteran director, Sidney J Furie. Hershey's committed performance is superb as she has to sell her encounters with an invisible force. Ron Silver also provides excellent support as her therapist who witnesses the horrors first-hand. At times the film is genuinely terrifying. Hereditary Alongside Robert Eggers, Ari Aster is the horror director who everyone seems to be anticipated as the next genre icon. Hereditary might owe a little to Rosemary's Baby and The Wicker Man but it's an enthralling horror film about demonic influences that have hereditary effects on the women of a particular family. Aster is skilled at crafting interesting character arcs and raising the levels of his performers. Toni Collette is sensational and was heinously overlooked at the Oscars with a powerhouse performance for the ages. The final act just has too much going on and too much owed to classic old films, but this unsettling film has great jumps, performances and an engaging storyline.|2025-03-16|https://www.flickeringmyth.com/essential-demonic-horror-movies/

Though fans went highly zealous and constantly made responses. Even the co-founder of twitter Jack Dorsey responded, I do not believe anyone should own or run twitter. It wants to be a good protocol level, not a company. He mentioned trusting Elon Musk is the singular solution he completely trust, he trusts Elon's mission to extend the light of consciousness. Not everybody approved his idea of free speech and it impacted in such a way that it led twitter users to quit their account. British actress Jameela Jamil is the most active user on twitter, she previously made a response to Kim's speech on women. She also made a sarcastic response to Elon Musk. She responded, one good thing about Elon buying twitter is that I will finally leave and stop being a complete menace to society here. She added, I would like this to be my, what lies here as my last tweet. I feel the fear for this free speech bid is going to help this hell platform reach its final form of totally lawless hate, misogyny and bigotry. Best of luck!

LOS ANGELES COUNTY—On Friday, March 14, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Police Chief, Jim McDonnell announced the death of Martin Pomeroy, who worked as interim police chief in 2000. I am deeply saddened by the passing of former interim Chief and Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy. Throughout his decades of service with the Los Angeles Police Department, Martin exemplified the highest standards of integrity, professionalism, and dedication to the people of this city. [Pomeroy] was appointed as the LAPD's 53rd Chief during a time of transition. Marty brought steady leadership, fairness, and a deep understanding of law enforcement's vital role in our communities. Though he once humbly described himself as 'so vanilla,' those who knew and served alongside him recognized the depth of his character, the strength of his principles, and his unwavering commitment to justice. Whether overseeing police operations at the 2000 Democratic National Convention, leading disaster response efforts after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, or guiding the Department through a period of change, he was a respected and steady force. Martin Pomeroy was more than a leader; he was a mentor, a trusted colleague, and a public servant who always put the needs of the community and the officers under his command first. He understood and appreciated the importance of civilian oversight in law enforcement, ensuring the Department remained accountable to the people it served. He was respected by both the rank and file and the communities we protect, a testament to his ability to bridge relationships and foster trust. His passing is a great loss to the LAPD family and the City of Los Angeles. On behalf of the men and women of the Los Angeles Police Department, I extend my deepest condolences to his family, friends, and all those whose lives he touched. His legacy of service, ethics, and dedication will not be forgotten. Rest in peace, Chief Pomeroy. In October 2002, Director of Policing, Bill Murray, made the following remarks. Recently you have received standing ovations when introduced in public. You deserve this. The Academy is full, officers are returning to the ranks, crime is on the way down, and the community has once again begun to believe its participation is welcomed by [the] LAPD. Many have said they regret 'losing' you, but we here at Los Angeles Community Policing know your heart will always be with the Department and community you have served so well.

25_Pete_Jones •For all their talk about the Illuminati, the bankers, the elite, the parasites and the demonic creatures, none of the speakers once mentioned the role that Zionism plays in this By Pete Papaherakles Bilderberg 2013 was beyond adoubt the most spectacular yearfor protesters against the Bilderberggroup. More than 2,000 peopleflooded the grounds of the Grove luxury resort in Watford, in Hertfordshire'slush British countryside, on Saturday,June 8, while another 1,500 gathered outsidedue to capacity restrictions, according to local police. These numbers are off the chart comparedto previous years and show an explosion thatmust be spreading panic into the hearts of the Bilderberg boys, as the late Jim Tucker liked to call them. Hundreds of police and security officerswere involved in and around the premises,and an additional £2M were requestedby Watford police to cover the additional expenses. It must be noted that thepolice were extremely friendly and courteous,and anyone who says otherwise is lying. The event took on the feel of a festival concert as an area about the size of two footballfields was filled with primarily young people,many of whom were strumming guitars, dancing and singing, and smoking marijuana while the police within thegrounds seemed to have no problems withany of it. Former Ohio Representative Jim Traficant gave apress conference to a crowd of reportersabout his take on Bilderberg and mingledwith the ever-growing crowd for several hours, sharing his unique insights and experience with everyone. At the festival, a stage was set up where speakers and entertainers addressed the public throughoutthe afternoon as the crowds filled the area. Two featured speakers included controversial author DavidIcke and radio show host Alex Jones.Icke took the stage first and opened with a tributeto Tucker. There's a spirit looking down upon us at the moment, and he's got a big smiling face and a big haton, and until very recently we used to know him asJim Tucker, Icke said. Decades ago, Jim was on the case when virtually no one had heard of theBilderberg group, let alone what it connects to. Icke then went on to talk about his hallmark theme of how we are all one and have to unite spirituallyin order to defeat Bilderberg. Jones came on next, in his trademark bombastic style, and the event started to resemble a professionalwrestling bout as Jones began barking insultsat the New World Order scum. He told a cheering crowd how the evil parasites wanted all of us killedor enslaved into their global tyranny. He told thecrowd that this day was the beginning of the fall of the Bilderberg group and that nothing could stopthe justice that is coming down upon them. These demonic creatures, these Nazi eugenicists, Jones bellowed, [are] finished once and forall because the freemen of this world will no longeracquiesce to their tyranny. Jones also paid tribute to Tucker for tirelessly pursuing the Bilderbergers for 36 years, although hecould not finish the sentence without telling thecrowd about his own heroics as he worked himself up to another frenzied crescendo about the globalist scum. His performance continued for whatseemed an eternity, culminating with growls and slogans about never surrendering, as his groupiescheered in ecstasy. For all their talk about the Illuminati, the bankers,the elite, the parasites and the demonic creatures,none of the speakers once mentioned the rolethat Zionism plays in this. Don't they know that most of the bankers, media, executives and so manyof the Bilderbergers are Zionists? So why does Jones constantly equate Bilderberg with Hitler, the Nazis and the Holocaust®?Could it be that some critics of Bilderberg arenothing more than tools of the Zionists who co-opted the anti-Bilderberg movement in order to leadyoung activists into confusion about who reallyruns the world and what their real agenda is?

As former Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte (pic) rallied supporters in Hong Kong, his team seemed unconcerned about rumours that the International Criminal Court might soon issue an arrest warrant against him. Despite a bitter political feud with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, Duterte's team believed any legal action would first take place in the Philippines, said Harry Roque, Duterte's former spokesman, in a phone interview from The Hague. It was a fatal mistake. In a span of two days, Duterte went from that Hong Kong rally to sitting glumly on a private jet delivering him to prosecutors at The Hague, where he faces accusations of being responsible for the extra-judicial killing of thousands of people from 2011-2019. He didn't expect the government to humiliate him, said lawyer Raul Lambino, a member of Duterte's political party and legal team. He's always maintained that if he'll be imprisoned or killed, that it'll happen in his country. Duterte made his first appearance before the court on Friday. After confirming his identity, age and place of birth via video link, Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set the next hearing, which will deal with whether the case can go to a full trial, for Sept 23. However the case at the ICC ends, the reverberations from the arrest and extradition won't subside soon. The Philippines was already reeling from the impeachment of Duterte's daughter, Vice-President Sara Duterte, last month over accusations she asked someone to kill the president. This is a political ploy of the Marcos regime, Roque said. They got rid of the biggest threat to the Marcos administration, and I'm just sad that the ICC fell for a Marcos ploy, he added. Marcos has pressed back on those accusations. He said the government was just doing its job by cooperating with Interpol and rejected accusations that there was any political persecution. The arrest we did today was in compliance with our commitments to Interpol, Marcos said on Tuesday. It just so happened it came from ICC. But it's not because it came from ICC, it's because it came from Interpol. The ICC Office of the Prosecutor, in a statement Wednesday, said its investigation showed there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr Duterte bears criminal responsibility for the crime against humanity of murder If Duterte's family and supporters really did believe that the man known as The Punisher would be able to fight extradition in the Philippines, that illusion collapsed when police and an Interpol representative met the 79-year-old upon his return to Manila. The ex-president had been prepared to surrender himself to the jurisdiction of Philippine authorities, not the ICC, Sara Duterte said Tuesday night, when she said she attempted to join her father at the airbase where he was detained for hours but was barred. A last-minute appeal to the Supreme Court quickly failed. Their options dwindling, the Duterte family fought to stave off the inevitable. In what he characterised as deference to the Duterte family's pleas, the police general who led the arrest, Nicolas Torre, said on Thursday that the ex-president was given time to rest, get adequate food and receive medical attention while he conferred with lawyers. But as the hours dragged on, Torre said he felt like the requests had become just another delaying tactic. In a video shared by another Duterte daughter, Veronica, Torre can be heard telling Salvador Medialdea, a top former aide to the president, We can do this the hard way. We can do this the easy way. The easy way was to pick three people to accompany Duterte on the plane to The Hague, immediately. The hard way was left unsaid. The former president boarded the chartered Gulfstream G550 jet, first to Dubai and then The Hague. In a Facebook video en route, he told his supporters not to worry. His family was furious. Sara called the move a state kidnapping and, in a March 11 statement, said the extradition was a blatant affront to our sovereignty. In 2023, Marcos publicly and privately rejected the ICC's jurisdiction in the case. In a Dec 15, 2023, letter to the vice--president, Marcos said he remained steadfast in my resolve that the jurisdiction of the ICC over the Republic of Philippines after the effectivity of its withdrawal therefrom is very much in question. Crucially, he added: To this end, this government will not assist the ICC in any way, shape, or form. The family started to prepare for battle, she added. But they weren't ready for how quickly their plans fell apart. Duterte still maintains a solid base of support in the Philippines, where many citizens lauded his tough on crime approach to drug trafficking. It's too soon to tell if sympathy will build for him and even help sway the election. But with previous ICC cases having dragged on for years, it's suddenly possible that a man whose opponents say ruled with near impunity – and who is now the first former Asian leader to be served an ICC arrest warrant –will never step foot in the Philippines again. Before landing in the Netherlands ahead of a Friday court appearance, Duterte said in a video posted on his Facebook account that he'd be taking responsibility for whatever happened in the past. This will be a long legal proceeding but I say to you, I will continue to serve my country and so be it if that's my destiny, Duterte added. — Bloomberg|2025-03-16|https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2025/03/16/from-punisher-to-prisoner
Although Chris Evans has insisted that he is happily retired from the MCU and won't be returning to Avengers: Doomsday, I'm going to take these comments with a generous pinch of salt after Andrew Garfield denied his involvement in Spider-Man: No Way Home. To be perfectly honest, I'm expecting Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars to feature a cavalcade of MCU actors, both new and old. For example, we are already certain that Robert Downey Jr. will be returning to the MCU as Doctor Doom, and I don't expect him to be the only legacy actor to appear. While many MCU productions in the Multiverse Saga have sidestepped the multiversal narrative that should be pervading them at this point, it would make no sense for Avengers: Doomsday, the first of two Avengers movies to wrap up the saga, to follow suit. While Avengers: Doomsday story details are still forthcoming, we can be almost certain that it will center on the multiverse and feature variants aplenty. While RDJ's involvement has given rise to rampant speculation that Chris Evans will join him, the Steve Rogers actor has recently refuted such claims - but I'm disinclined to trust him on this. Chris Evans Denied Reports He's Returning To The MCU For Avengers: Doomsday The Steve Rogers Actor Claims He Is Retired Reports began to surface in mid-December that Chris Evans was the latest MCU star to join the cast of Avengers: Doomsday, according to a report by The Wrap. Unsurprisingly, this supercharged the holiday season with speculation over his role, with the prevailing theory positing that he would be portraying a Captain America variant - specifically, an evil one. Two months later, Esquire quizzed Chris Evans himself on the report and gained a response, ostensibly learning straight from the horse's mouth that these reports were unfounded and that he is happily retired from the MCU. His full quote is as follows: That's not true, though. This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years—ever since Endgame. I've just stopped responding to it... Yeah, no—happily retired! It's unclear whether the events that Chris asserts happen every couple years refer to Avengers: Doomsday specifically, but it certainly speaks to his popularity. Despite ostensibly retiring in Avengers: Endgame, Steve Rogers is, for all intents and purposes, still alive in the MCU, so it's no wonder why fans are theorizing about when Old Man Rogers will pop up again. Still, I think the return of a younger Steve Rogers, capable of getting back in on the action, is the preferable state of affairs. Split image of old steve rogers up looking happy and sam wilson's captain america looking concerned Related Captain America: Brave New World will be released worldwide this weekend, and it once again raises the question of Steve Rogers' whereabouts. Evans also insisted that he stopped responding to such reports, evidently referencing the fact that he all but allowed the rumor mill to churn away for two months before speaking out. His silence, for many, spoke volumes, and while I was initially disheartened to see him definitively put a stop to the conversation, I'm now beginning to doubt if he's being truthful. We have, after all, seen another MCU actor read from this playbook before. Andrew Garfield Denied Being In Spider-Man: No Way Home - Only To Actually Be In It He Gave A Very Convincing Performance Before The Movie's Release Although he can't be directly blamed, Andrew Garfield has kind of ruined the credibility of MCU actors who deny their involvement in an upcoming MCU movie. This is because, in the run-up to Spider-Man: No Way Home, Garfield was repeatedly questioned about being brought back as a Peter Parker variant in the movie, which he repeatedly denied. For example, when being interviewed by the Happy Sad Confused podcast in May 2021, Garfield repeated that he wasn't called by Marvel Studios or Sony to return to the role, a clip of which can be seen below via X: Garfield also said as much to Variety in September the same year, stating, ...it's important for me to say on the record that this is not something I'm aware I am involved in. To be fair to Garfield, he wasn't the only one fielding off these questions, as Tom Holland asserted to Esquire in February 2021: No, no, [Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield] will not be appearing in this film. Nevertheless, it seemed to be Garfield that was asked the most, and gave the most effusive repudiations. This, of course, turned out to be an act. All but the most skeptical fans were stunned to see Garfield's Peter Parker appear halfway through Spider-Man: No Way Home and go on to play a central role. In fact, Garfield was on top form as the funniest of the three Peters, and featured in a heart-rending moment with MJ as he successfully saved her life in a tragic callback to losing Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. While I think Garfield deserves praise for successfully throwing fans off the scent, it now puts Chris Evans in an unenviable position. I'm Having Trouble Believing Chris Evans' Denials About Avengers: Doomsday Marvel's Secrecy Policy Makes Believing Its Actors Harder Than Ever MCU Avengers & Steve Rogers / Custom Imade By Ana Nieves Andrew Garfield's impeccable acting ability was enough to fend off accurate reports that he'd be starring in Spider-Man: No Way Home, but it has now set a new precedent that other MCU actors will have to deal with forevermore. To put it bluntly, Garfield, Holland, and Maguire have proven that Marvel Studios has sanctioned outright deceit when it comes to dealing with the press. Now, when Chris Evans states, Yeah, no- happily retired! I can't help but doubt him. Shrouding its projects in mystery has become as much of an MCU trope as the post-credits scene or the superhero landing. This goes as far as to treat anything but a categorical response to the effect of I will not be in Avengers: Doomsday as a tacit acknowledgment that Evans will, in fact, be in Avengers: Doomsday. In his interview with the Happy Sad Confused podcast, for example, Garfield stops short of outright stating he won't be in Spider-Man: No Way Home and instead asserts that he hadn't received a call. This, of course, could be entirely true. Instead, he omits the part where he might have been asked to star in the film via email or in person. Chris Evans and Doctor Doom from the comics Related Now that Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans are both returning to Avengers: Doomsday, it's time to see what other Marvel stars could return evil. The blame here, of course, is with Marvel Studios and the unparalleled amount of secrecy surrounding its projects. Shrouding its projects in mystery has become as much of an MCU trope as the post-credits scene or the superhero landing. The MCU's next movie, Thunderbolts*, is a prime example of this, as a firestorm of speculation surrounds what the titular asterisk represents. To be perfectly honest, I think this is good. Quashing a big reveal is infinitely worse than stoking uncertainty, and I'd rather be pleasantly surprised at Chris Evans' MCU return - even if it isn't in Avengers: Doomsday. Why Chris Evans Has To Return For Avengers: Secret Wars If Not Doomsday Marvel Can't Bring Back RDJ Without Bringing Back Chris Evans I feel like it would be remiss of Marvel to reintroduce RDJ to the MCU and not do the same for his co-star, Chris Evans, who is just as synonymous with the cinematic franchise. Avengers: Secret Wars is the perfect place to do this. If it adapts the 2015 run of comics as most expect, it stands to reason that plenty of Steve Rogers variants will populate Battleworld, an eventuality that extends to the remainder of the MCU's legendary cast. At this point, I'd even be happy with Chris Evans returning as another character entirely. There was also some confusion around Benedict Cumberbatch's involvement in Avengers: Doomsday, as the actor said Doctor Strange would not feature before recently walking back those comments. Chris Evans has already returned to the MCU once as Johnny Storm in Deadpool & Wolverine, and while I would much rather see him reprise his more famous role (preferably as the evil Hydra Supreme), I'm willing to settle for him following Robert Downey Jr.'s lead. The details of RDJ's portrayal of Doctor Doom is another Marvel mystery, but it ostensibly continues the precedent that actors synonymous with the MCU can return as different characters. With that in mind, there are some interesting routes Marvel could take. While another Johnny Storm or Captain America variant (like Nomad or Yeoman America) are the most obvious picks, it would be interesting if Evans mirrored RDJ's portrayal of Iron Man's opposite by portraying Steve Rogers's own opposite, Red Skull. Alternatively, Avengers: Secret Wars could have fun by having him portray another beloved superhero team leader: Cyclops. Whatever the case, I don't expect he'll return after the Multiverse Saga, so here's hoping that Evans is emulating Garfield, and we will, in fact, see him one last time in Avengers: Doomsday or its sequel.

Claiming the United States was being invaded by a Venezuelan gang, President Donald Trump on Saturday invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a sweeping war time authority that allows the president broader leeway on policy and executive action, to speed up mass deportations of people in the country illegally — potentially pushing his promised crackdown on immigration into higher gear. Trump's declaration targets Tren de Aragua, contending it is a hostile force acting at the behest of Venezuela's government. The declaration comes the same day that a federal judge in Washington barred the administration from deporting five Venezuelans under the expected order, a hint at the legal battle brewing over Trump's move. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. A federal judge on Saturday blocked the Trump administration from using an 18th century law known as the Alien Enemies Act to deport five Venezuelans, kicking off a blizzard of litigation over the controversial move even before the president has announced it. President Donald Trump has widely signaled he would invoke the 1798 Act, last used to justify the internment of Japanese-American civilians during World War 2. On Saturday, the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward filed an extraordinary lawsuit in federal court in Washington contending the order would identify a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua, as a predatory incursion by a foreign government and seek to deport any Venezuelan in the country as a member of that gang, regardless of the facts. James E. Boasberg, chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, agreed to implement a temporary restraining order preventing the deportation for 14 days under the act of the five Venezuelans who are already in immigration custody and believed they were being moved to be deported. Boasberg said his order was to preserve the status quo. Boasberg scheduled a hearing for later in the afternoon to see if his order should be expanded to protect all Venezuelans in the United States. Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the initial restraining order, contending that halting a presidential act before it has been announced would cripple the executive branch. If the order were allowed to stand, district courts would have license to enjoin virtually any urgent national-security action just upon receipt of a complaint, the Justice Department wrote in its appeal. It said district courts might then issue temporary restraining orders on actions such as drone strikes, sensitive intelligence operations, or terrorist captures or extraditions. The court should halt that path in its tracks, the department argued. The unusual flurry of litigation highlights the controversy around the Alien Enemies Act, which could give Trump vast power to deport people in the country illegally. It could let him bypass some protections of normal criminal and immigration law. But it would face immediate challenges along the lines of Saturday's litigation because it has previously only been used during wartime. The law requires a formal declaration of war before it can be used. But immigration lawyers were alarmed by a flurry of activity Friday night. Last night, it appears the government was preparing to deport a number of Venezuelans they had no legal authority to deport, said Ahilan Arulanantham, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles who filed two petitions to block deportations that night.|2025-03-16|https://www.kimt.com/news/trump-invokes-18th-century-law-to-declare-invasion-by-gangs-and-speed-deportations/article_2821f7aa-01df-11f0-a0a4-1fd9b5d8f03f.html

After a leaked Sony artificial intelligence experiment was released onto the Internet featuring an AI-generated version of Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn, Ashly Burch shared here thoughts in an official statement. Burch is the award-winning performer behind the voice and motion capture of Aloy in Guerrilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn series. She has confirmed that she nor Guerrilla weren't involved with the Playstation Sony AI experiment and there is no active development on the project. Burch also cited that her facial data nor her voice are used in the AI prototype and she noted that the demo made her worried about her own career as well as the many video game actors who are currently on strike with SAG-AFTRA against AI. Videos by ComicBook.com The internal Sony tech demo that was released on YouTube has since been taken down due to copyright, but the video showcases an AI-powered Aloy created by PlayStation Stuidos' advanced technology group, which lists Sony Interactive Entertainment as a client. While the video itself seems to be based on a real demo within Sony, it strikes a chord with many given its implications of AI rights and regulations. In the video, software engineer director Sharwin Raghoebardajal chats with Aloy through AI-generated speech via voice prompts. When it comes to the technology used, it's through OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text as well as Sony's Emotional Voice Synthesis system and Sony's Mockingbird technology for facial animation. RELATED: Horizon Zero Dawn Fans Divided Over Aloy Movie Casting This leak was a tough pill for voice actors to swallow, given the ongoing strike against this issue with SAG-AFTRA, which is focused on getting improved protections over the use of artificial intelligence. As it is tough for someone like Burch to speak out about the ongoing AI situation, given her work with some of these video game companies, the issue allowed Burch to address the Aloy video and call to action. In a social media video posted by Burch, she expressed her worry about the advancements of AI and its possibility of taking jobs without their consent. She states, I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form…We are currently on strike…Because this technology exists, because we know that game companies want to use it, we're asking for protections, Burch said. It's not hard to see how AI is being used by major companies, which won't change anytime soon. With this being said, how performers are treated in the use of AI is a valuable initiative. To give a clearer picture of the issues that lie in the technological advancements being used for purposes seen in Sony's leak, Burch states, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it, Burch continued. That does have someone's voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back…It scares me. Burch reiterates her love for the gaming industry and hopes that a deal can be reached to instate clear rules regarding the use of AI in performances and to continue the art form that has been going on for decades.|2025-03-16|https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-ashly-burch-playstation-ai-aloy/
Updated March 15, 2025 at 19:56 PM ET In his latest move to clamp down on illegal immigration and immigration more broadly, President Trump has filed a presidential action invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a seldom-used law that gives the president authority to detain or deport nationals of an enemy nation during wartime. It's only the fourth time in American history a president has used the act — and the first since World War II. The directive targets members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan prison gang, and authorizes expedited removal of all Venezuelan citizens 14 and older, deemed to be members of the organization, who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. According to the presidential action, those people are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued an order hours after Trump invoked the wartime power stopping the administration from using it to deport anyone, adding that the administration should turn planes already in the air around. Earlier in the day, in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and Democracy Forward, Boasberg had blocked the administration from deporting five Venezuelan men for 14 days. Another hearing on the matter will take place Friday. An executive action signed in January that designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization paved the way for the direct removal of its members from U.S. territory under the Alien Enemies Act, declaring they, along with MS-13, a gang with origins in El Salvador not included in Saturday's action, present an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy. The expedited removal process allowed under the act means that those subject to the president's declaration would not go through the normal immigration court process, or be able to claim asylum. Advocates fear that invoking the act would also open the door for targeting and deportations of other individuals regardless of their status or criminal records. There's nothing in the law itself that would require it to be limited to undocumented individuals or individuals who have committed crimes, said Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel on the liberty and national security team at the center-left Brennan Center for Justice. It's not about legal status, consistent with the idea that it's a wartime authority, not an immigration authority. It is also unclear how the inclusion of minors in the president's action Saturday will play into legal challenges. Trump has laid the groundwork to bring back the old law Trump threatened today's move since his early days on the campaign trail in 2023. In several rallies he vowed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to target and dismantle every migrant criminal network. Immigration was a top theme throughout his campaign, during which he also promised the largest deportation actions in the country's history. At the Republican National Convention last July, the GOP committed to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States, as a part of the party platform. Trump has long argued that the act would give tremendous authority for immigration law enforcement. Detentions and deportations conducted through the act would not go through the immigration court system, and would allow Trump to bypass the traditional deportation process, according to Morgan Bailey, who served as deputy chief of staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during Trump's first term, which includes appearing before a judge. Under the Aliens Enemies Act, this aspect of going through each of these steps is abbreviated, and there isn't an aspect of showing or allowing the individual to have their day in court before the immigration judge, Bailey said. Rather, the person could be deported simply based upon the aspect of whether or not they are a national of a particular country. Legal challenges to enforcing the Act remain The Alien and Enemies Act is the last of the four Alien and Sedition acts, the other three which have been repealed or expired. It allows the president to detain, relocate or deport non-citizens from a foreign nation or government considered an enemy during wartime. The last time the act was invoked was WWII, during which 31,000 suspected enemy aliens of mostly Japanese, Italian and German descent were placed in internment camps and military facilities. The law requires war to be formally declared — which only Congress has the authority to do. George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the conservative Center of Immigration Studies and former deputy general counsel at Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, has been a strong proponent of the act. Still, he has acknowledged the legal challenges in defining illegal immigration as an invasion and labeling gangs as foreign nations. It'll be an uphill struggle to get the federal court to sign off on its use, Fishman said. Federal courts have never up until now bought off en masse illegal immigration as getting the definition of invasion under the US Constitution's use of the term. But he said that the question of invasion and predatory incursion could still be reasonably argued in court. Immigrant rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, are already fighting the effort and have urged local governments to put in place measures that limit the use of local resources to assist with immigration enforcement. Legal experts also say there is legal precedent that may make this difficult as well. Ebright said that historical efforts to make wartime powers into peacetime immigration enforcement have never succeeded in the courts. Challenges will come from the nonprofit sector, advocacy space as well as from states…and very well could result in the courts striking down an effort to use the Alien Enemies Act, Ebright said. But it is not completely clear what the courts will do. Copyright 2025 NPR|2025-03-16|https://www.kjzz.org/politics/2025-03-15/federal-judge-blocks-trumps-plan-to-target-alien-enemies-for-deportation
The early 2000s were a different time. A wild time, even. The music ranged from incredible to downright terrible. The trends in music back then were very different from what they are today. Quite a few songs from that era have aged really badly, too. I doubt that these three 2000s songs would do anything other than flop (or cause a lot of online discourse) if they were released today. Let's take a look! Videos by American Songwriter 1. Ur So Gay by Katy Perry Ur So Gay by Katy Perry isn't the pop star's only offensive song, but it's loaded with a lot of questionable lyrics. This 2007 pop song opens up with the line I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf while j*rking off listening to Mozart . And it only gets worse from there. The whole theme of this song is about Perry being hurt that a man wasn't romantically interested in her, and she deduces that he absolutely must be homosexual. Why else wouldn't he be interested in her?! 2. This Is Why I'm Hot by MIMS This example of 2000s songs that would probably flop today isn't horrible, controversial, or crude. Rather, it's just too cringey to survive the 2020s social media critical landscape. The whole of the 2006 hip hop song This Is Why I'm Hot by MIMS is just about MIMS hyping himself up. Lines like I'm hot cause I'm fly / You ain't cause you not would have landed MIMS in eternal cringe memedom forever. The irony of this track is that MIMS breaks down, quite repetitively, why he's an amazing musician; and yet, he never went on to make another true hit after this song. 3. Don't Trust Me by 3OH!3 A very obvious entry on our list of 2000s songs that would flop today comes from early crunkcore outfit 3OH!3. Don't Trust Me was a club favorite in 2008, but its lyrics are… interesting. In a morbid way. I don't even feel comfortable including any lines from this song, considering it's quite misogynistic. It even features a sexualizing line about Helen Keller. Yes, you read that correctly. This song would likely flop today because of its subject matter, as well as the fact that crunkcore died off for a reason.|2025-03-16|https://americansongwriter.com/3-hit-songs-from-the-2000s-that-would-flop-today/
The Girl Scouts of the USA organization is named in a lawsuit that claims the iconic fundraising Girl Scout cookies contain elevated amounts of heavy metals and pesticides. The Girl Scouts have countered that the cookies are safe and pose no health concerns. USA Today reports the federal class action lawsuit was filed by a New York woman who cites results of a commissioned study of the cookies that indicated 100% of those tested contained heavy metals, toxins, and pesticides. The study was commissioned by Moms Across America and GMO Science. Read more at Newsmax© 2025 Newsmax.

X-Men just made. a major revelation on the status of Omega-level mutants in X-Men #13 from Ryan Stegman and Marte Gracia. Not only does it bring back the concept for some more fleshing out after its expansion with the Krakoa Era of Marvel's mutants, but has also changed who we previously thought of as Omega-level as well. For readers, this is a big deal. The origin of the term stretches back to Chris Claremont's legendary original run on The Uncanny X-Men back in the '70s and '80s. After some dormancy, he brought the term back in the 2000s, planting seeds for the current era and the recent revival of the X-Men animated series. At the close of the Krakoan age in the Fall of X, two Omega-level mutants save the day, with Cyclops holding off Nimrod, who recognizes the mutant's potential, while Storm puts in the finishing touches. Ororo Munroe has since become an Avenger and a greater part of the Marvel Universe as a whole, possibly setting up an impressive future in the MCU. Videos by ComicBook.com But with those current events and the new details revealed in the current X-Men run, what is an Omega-level mutant exactly? What distinguishes them from the other mutants we see running around the 616-universe? For many, the belief has been that Omega designates the most powerful mutants in the world, but it turns out this isn't exactly the final fact on the topic. What Exactly Was an Omega-Level Mutant Previously? Marvel The first Omega-level mutant classified in the X-Men comics was Rachel Summers during the Days of Future Past storyline in August 1986. Much like his modern version, Nimrod is the catalyst who determines the status and notes that Summers' upper limit hasn't been determined, which is a key aspect of the definition. This means that the power level for an Omega-level mutant is high but does have a limit. Claremont brought the concept back in 2001 during his X-Men Forever but never fully fleshed it out to be more than a device for the writers to use to denote characters that were important or major threats. As for who all was on that list of powerful mutants, there was no official list of mutants for years until Jonathan Hickman decided to bring it back during the Krakoan/House of X era and give it a bit of definition, listing fourteen Omegas with their demonstrated powers. [RELATED 5 X-Men Stories X-Men '97 Fans Need to Read ] Who Are The Omega-Level Mutants As We Know Them? Before the Krakoan Age, there were many X-Men characters hinted to be Omega, including favorites like Cable, Psylocke, and the White Queen/Emma Frost. But it wasn't until 2001 that the term took more concrete form, labeling Iceman (Bobby Drake) and Jean Grey as Omega-level in X-Men Forever #3. Through 2012's Avengers Vs. X-Men event, eight other names were hinted to be Omega. This includes current member Kid Omega, Cyclops' brother Vulcan, Storm, Professor Xavier's son Legion, and Hope Summers. Once the House of X rolled around, Magneto, Jamie Braddock, Proteus, and Exodus all joined the official list. There was also some controversy over Franklin Richards, classified as Powerhouse and possibly the strongest Omega in the Marvel Universe. Who can forget when the Fantastic Four's kid created an entire pocket universe to save his family and friends from Charles Xavier's evil side, Onslaught? It would also explain how he was able to usurp Galactus in the Earth X timeline, taking the mantle himself and fighting the Celestials. The addition of Arrako to the X-Men lore expanding things even further. More Omega mutants were discovered as part of the island Arrako, later traveling to Mars to make it the first mutant planet in the Marvel universe. Lodus Logos, Ora Serrta, Sobunar of the Depths, Tarn the Uncaring and several others were all added to the mix to expand the Omega ranks. We also saw Forge and the horsemen of Apocalypse earning the title, but not Apocalypse himself. Pretty odd, in retrospect. Now, Charles Xavier has joined the Omega ranks in X-Men #13 and turned it all on its head. True Nature of Omega-Level, Redefined This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is jean-grey-phoenix.jpg / Marvel X-Men #13 sees Xavier declare himself to be Omega-level and reveal that in addition to being powerful, there really is no actual limit to their power levels. Gone is the cap to how powerful an Omega-level mutant can be. However, even with the idea that Omega-level mutants have limitless power that doesn't mean they are invincible. In the issue, Xavier also explains that when two Omega-level mutants come into conflict, the deciding factor for a victor would be based on other variables — such as experience. It's complicated, and it's clearly going to come into play in future stories. A perfect example is the way Cyclops has used his powers over the years, particularly in the refurbished animated series, where he is reintroduced using his optic beams to safely fall from a plane. He also demonstrates top skill in battle, using his optic beams to move around while fighting. Magneto and Jean Grey are also no-brainers, given their incredible demonstrations of power over the years. We've seen the master of magnetism lift Asteroid M, reconfigure an entire army of Sentinels, and even shift the magnetic poles of Earth. Grey, on the other hand, is always seemingly at war with her true potential within and the Phoenix Force that chose her initially. As Dark Phoenix, she was able to destroy an entire solar system by consuming its sun. So, What's Next? With Xavier joining the ranks (albeit self-appointed) there are probably questions over the concept continuing on. What Xavier seems to imply is that all mutants have the potential to be Omega-level, with training and lessons on properly using their powers. If that's the case and it's no longer a matter simply of natural gifts, it could shift the focus for how various characters move forward. It could also create big challenges for mutants with humans and how everyone is perceived, as if that hasn't already been an issue over the years. Outside of comics, this new definition could come into play as well. We've also already had the concept introduced in the MCU with Cassandra Nova. She is labeled an Omega-level mutant by the TVA in Deadpool and Wolverine. So the concept is ready to take off when the X-Men are officially added to the mix and take the lead in the coming phases. Give us a film version of the Krakoan Era and it might be the perfect vehicle for the X-Men going forward, complete with an evolving idea of what it means to be truly Omega-level. Where do you think we'll get to with the X-Men as they enter the MCU fray?

In late January, we profiled a report by Boston University and the U.S. Conference of Mayors that shows Louisville is often named by mayors of other cities as a source of policy inspiration. Louisville was cited as a source of inspiration at the same rate of high-profile cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and Portland, Ore. 01-louisville-gives-inspiration / Mayor Fischer cited initiatives like Resurfaced have other cities asking questions about Louisville. (Courtesy Resurfaced) To get a better understanding of what other cities like about Louisville, we asked Mayor Greg Fischer what his administration is hearing from other mayors around the country. What is Louisville doing so well that others are taking notice? Mayor Fischer got back to us over email to share his thoughts on what makes Louisville a great city. And what other cities his administration looks to for ideas. Broken Sidewalk: A new report from Boston University and the U.S. Conference of Mayors says that a lot of other cities are looking at Louisville for inspiration. Have you heard from other mayors that they like what they see in Louisville? What are they telling you they like about the city? Mayor Greg Fischer: Our city has become a source of inspiration for other cities. The common theme behind most of the inquiries we receive is innovation, whether it is social innovation like compassion, education innovation like Cradle to Career, performance innovation like LouieStat, or our built environment innovation like Resurfaced. Mayor Fischer cited initiatives like Resurfaced have other cities asking questions about Louisville. (Courtesy Resurfaced) / A screen capture of the LouieStat website. Most of the principles behind our innovation work derive from my private sector experience. For example, I believe we were the first city in the country to create the position of Chief for Civic Innovation, and to establish an initiative like LouieStat, which added private sector improvement techniques, such as Lean and Six Sigma, to traditional government stat programs. People are increasingly interested in our efforts around compassion, which I consider social innovation. More and more cities are adopting compassion charters. When I was first elected and made compassion one of three guiding pillars for my administration, some people warned it would make me—and our city—look weak. In fact, it has made us stronger—when social challenges arise, we've got the social muscle to power us through. And other cities are taking note, recognizing in part that compassion is also good for business. I asked the CEO of Computershare what made the difference between his company choosing us or the other finalist city when deciding where to locate his business and 250 jobs. He said one reason they chose Louisville is that they liked our city's focus on compassion. A screen capture of the LouieStat website. / Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) Specifically (policies, initiatives, or otherwise), what are the kinds of things other cities are coming to Louisville for advice or inspiration on? What are you hearing from other mayors? Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) / Mayor Fischer and community members load water to be shipped to Flint, Michigan. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) There is a range of initiatives, from our focus on data, as evidenced by the LouieStat initiative and our Office for Performance Improvement, to our inclusion of compassion as a guiding pillar. Our work around performance improvement and innovation was highlighted when Governing magazine and my administration co-hosted the first ever Summit on Performance Improvement & Innovation in 2015, with a follow-up seminar scheduled for later this year. Our Open Data Policy has received national attention—including from the White House—and is being modeled elsewhere. Our policy includes a strong open by default provision, which means that all information that is legally accessible is proactively disclosed online. That includes data on police/citizen interactions. Other cities also are looking at how we use data to tackle big challenges of a community like air quality and city heat differentials. For example, we were among the first cities in the nation to do a heat island study and a tree canopy study. These studies are turning into real long-term solutions—this year, we will be announcing tree planting goals, for example, which will impact Louisville for generations to come. Mayor Fischer and community members load water to be shipped to Flint, Michigan. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) Our involvement in Asthmapolis is another good example of where we smartly use data and innovative technology to improve people's lives. More than 100,000 people in the Louisville area suffer from asthma. Ted Smith, our Chief of Civic Innovation, got us involved in the Asthmapolis research on smart inhalers—every time a participant uses their inhaler, a sensor sends information to researchers and records the information for the patient and his or her doctor. That helps the doctor identify patients who need more help controlling the disease, and helps us identify community-wide asthma triggers that can be improved or eliminated. Other initiatives getting notice include Code Louisville, an innovative public-private partnership that teaches citizens of all ages the software coding skills essential to high-tech jobs. That's an area our business community highlighted as an urgent need. Our work around black male achievement is significantly ahead of many cities, as we started in May 2012 with work that culminated in creation of our Office for Safe and Healthy Neighborhoods. Many cities have just started focusing on this in the past year. Other areas of interest include how we're rebuilding our Downtown and surrounding neighborhoods with infill developments, and our Cradle to Career program. And of course, there's our partnership with Google Fiber, which other cities would love to have. 02-louisville-gives-inspiration What does it mean that Louisville is listed as a source of inspiration at the same level as other cities like Seattle, San Francisco, or Portland, Ore.? Is Louisville being discovered or has this been going on behind the scenes a while? We are a city in transformation with tremendous momentum, and the way people view Louisville is definitely changing. My main focus when I took office was to create a sense of entrepreneurism and can-do into our city. I felt we had work to do to make our city more compelling and forward-looking. Our city has great bones with our neighborhoods and built environment. Today, our downtown is surging with a score of new hotels, a soon-to-be expanded convention center, and many new residential options. Our music and arts scene is booming. We have created our city's first ever 365-day-a-year tourism experience around bourbon and local food tourism, also known as Bourbonism. The IdeaFestival and the Festival of Faiths now have a global reputation. Move over, Portland. America has new hipster capital – Louisville. So says today's London Times (yep, as in England) pic.twitter.com/fNDvZTxaN4 — Greg Fischer (@GregFischerLou) February 1, 2015 Look at the national rankings from 2015 alone: No. 2 on the USA Today list of Best Local Food Scenes. We're on Time magazine's list of America's Best Music Scenes. We are the New Hipster Capital, according to the London Times. Our transformation into one of the world's great travel destinations has been trumpeted in Time magazine, USA Today, Travel + Leisure, and many, many others. That kind of publicity helps us compete for global business and talent. And that, in turn, prompted Site Selection Magazineto list us among Top 10 cities for Economic Development. If you're trying to draw in a young, educated workforce—and we are—it's a very good thing to be mentioned in the same breath as Seattle, San Francisco, and Portland. The knowledge workers who power the new economy, and the companies that employ them, want a city with a great quality of life, signature arts and cultural events, diverse food and music, multi-modal transportation options, and one-of-a-kind parks. This shows we compete well in these areas. Food trucks in front of the Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts. (jpellgen / Flickr) / Flickr / A ribbon cutting ceremony for a new bus stop in the SoBro neighborhood. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) What does it mean for Louisville that it's being held up as a model for others? What responsibility does that give us? What do we need to do to stay in front as a point of inspiration for years to come? My team's responsibility is to maximize the potential of our city. If other cities are modeling us, that's great. But we are not content with measuring progress against ourselves. We want to be recognized as one of the great cities in the world. To do this, we will continue to innovate around and leverage our authenticity and our competitive advantages; that's how we grow jobs, boost our economy and create a healthier city of lifelong learning and increased compassion. The biggest issue that will determine the future of Louisville is how well we do around our city value of lifelong learning. If we have a creative workforce ready for a rapidly changing global economy, our population will grow and opportunities will proliferate. It is a virtuous cycle. A ribbon cutting ceremony for a new bus stop in the SoBro neighborhood. (Courtesy Office of the Mayor) Advances in lifelong learning, guided by our Cradle to Career mission, will lead to advances in our other two guiding city values – health (physical, mental, environmental), and compassion (respect for all of our citizens so that their human potential is flourishing). It is important to me and my team that all citizens have an opportunity to benefit in our city's successes, and programs like Cradle to Career help ensure that by creating pathways to skill building and workforce development. And of course, we will continue working to increase our international presence and attract more skilled immigrant workers. For Louisville to prosper and maximize opportunities for all citizens, we must do more than keep up with global change – we need to leap ahead. And foreign-born citizens will help make that leap. What three cities are you looking at for inspiration? What are they doing right that you think Louisville can learn from? San Francisco is doing some great work around innovation. We are benchmarking our summer youth employment progress against Boston. Nashville has done a great job creating a can-do, positive creative vibe for their city.|2025-03-16|https://brokensidewalk.com/2016/greg-fischer-interview/
President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday began making deep cuts to Voice of America and other government-run, pro-democracy programming, with a press advocacy group saying all VOA employees have been put on leave. On Friday night, shortly after Congress passed its latest funding bill, Trump directed his administration to reduce the functions of several agencies to the minimum required by law. That included the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which houses Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and Asia and Radio Marti, which beams Spanish-language news into Cuba. On Saturday morning, Kari Lake, the failed Arizona gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidate whom Trump named a senior adviser to the agency, posted on X that employees should check their email. That coincided with notices going out placing Voice of America staff on paid administrative leave. Later, Reporters Without Borders said the notices extended to everyone who works for VOA. The advocacy group said it condemns this decision as a departure from the U.S.'s historic role as a defender of free information and calls on the U.S. government to restore VOA and urges Congress and the international community to take action against this unprecedented move. The Agency for Global Media also sent notices terminating grants to Radio Free Asia and other programming run by the agency. Voice of America transmits United States domestic news into other countries, often translated into local languages. Radio Free Asia, Europe and Marti beam news into countries with authoritarian regimes in those regions like China, North Korea and Russia. Combined, the networks reach an estimated 427 million people. They date back to the Cold War and are part of a network of government-funded organizations trying to extend U.S. power and combat authoritarianism that includes USAID, another agency targeted by Trump. The latest reductions are especially provocative because the Agency for Global Media is an independent agency chartered by Congress, which passed a law in 2020 limiting the power of the agency's presidentially appointed executives. Trump has already taken several moves to gut congressionally-mandated programs, setting up a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of presidential power. Trump's order requiring reductions also includes several other, lesser-known government agencies such as the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan think tank, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The Trump administration has already made several controversial moves regarding Voice of America, including suspending a respected journalist who noted criticism of Trump and canceling contracts that allowed VOA to use material from independent news organizations, such as The Associated Press. Associated Press writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.

The 18th series of the popular ITV talent show began late last month (February). Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and Bruno Tonioli are back again as judges on the show, joined this season by internet personality, boxer and rapper KSI (guest judge). Ant and Dec have also returned as BGT hosts. How much is Ant and Dec's net worth? Why is Britain's Got Talent not on this weekend? BGT was removed from ITV's Saturday night schedule this weekend (March 15), replaced by the final match of the 2025 Guinness Six Nations tournament between France and Scotland. Kick off for the Six Nations clash was at 8pm and so ITV coverage was scheduled for 7.15pm to 10.35pm meaning there was no room for BGT which usually airs at 7pm. Coverage of the France v Scotland match also meant popular ITV quiz show The 1% Club, hosted by Lee Mack, was also bumped from the Saturday night schedule. 'Absolute joke': Fans fuming as BGT pulled from ITV schedule In the absence of BGT, fans took to social media instead on Saturday night to vent their frustration at the silly decision to pull the show from the weekend schedule.

(KPEL-FM) - Hopefully at some point in your life, you'll be ready (mentally and financially) to clock out one last time and enjoy your golden years. From Shreveport to New Orleans, Baskin to Baton Rouge, Louisiana residents are taking their first steps as retirees. K945, The Hit Music Channel logo / Canva Get our free mobile app There are plenty of factors that are involved in the decision to retire. Some are voluntary, including making the call based on your financial ability and the mindset of 'I've completed everything I've set out to do at my job'. Some are involuntary, like health concerns, aging out of your chosen industry, and family influences. Deciding when to retire is also influenced by the changes in Social Security in their (feels very arbitrary) changes to the official retirement age in relation to the amount of money you will receive in retirement. Sometimes, people have to work past their official retirement age for financial reasons which is pretty sad. All that being said, retirees will often times make a change in location as part of their last chapter. Some will decide to move to a destination they've always wanted to visit but never had the opportunity. Others may move closer to family members who have moved away. Even more end up settling where they are instead of going through the hassles of a change of address. Retirement is not always an easy decision, and some retirees had regrets. Here are the top 5 regrets for older retirees In Louisiana, we have a diverse selection of parishes across the state that offer unique opportunities to residents. Parishes differ in their cost of living, access to affordable health care, activities and even the weather. It was along these lines that Niche dug into the numbers and ranked Louisiana's parishes according to these metrics. Below are the results, which show the rankings of Louisiana parishes including the top 25 destinations that are best for retirees.

Nikola Jokic tormented the Washington Wizards three months ago and his impressive effort didn't even result in a victory. Because his career-high 56 points ended in defeat, Jokic figures to pack plenty of motivation when the Denver Nuggets host the Wizards on Saturday night. Jokic made 22 of 39 field-goal attempts and collected 16 rebounds and eight assists but his one-man domination ended with a 122-113 setback on Dec. 7. Jokic's scoring effort was the second best in Nuggets history behind David Thompson's memorable 73-point outing on the final day of the 1977-78 season. Thompson was bidding for the scoring title but finished second because George Gervin scored 63 for the San Antonio Spurs later that day. Nothing major like that was at stake but lowly Washington was thrilled with the outcome. Jordan Poole made a career-best nine 3-pointers and scored 39 points in the contest as the Wizards snapped a six-game skid in the series. Nuggets coach Michael Malone hasn't forgotten what happened in D.C. They already beat us, Malone said after Friday's victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. Even if we won by 40 or lost by 40, Washington already beat us. If there's any, 'Oh, we got these guys,' – that's what we thought last time and they beat us. When you're playing against a team that has already beaten you, that should be all the attention you need going into the game, in my opinion. Washington rested Friday night in Denver while the Nuggets (43-24) were fighting off the Lakers for a 131-126 home victory. The score was tied at 126 when Jamal Murray buried a 3-pointer with 5.6 seconds left. Murray had 26 points. Jokic scored 28 points and Christian Braun added 22. Malone was displeased with the contest against a shorthanded Los Angeles team missing LeBron James and Luka Doncic, among others. This isn't a beauty pageant, Malone said. We don't get rated on our wins. It's a win. One thing that bothered Malone was that Jokic and Murray only took 16 shots apiece. I got to get those two guys 20 to 25 shots per game, easy, Malone said. That's no disrespect to anybody else. We need those guys to carry the offensive load. Saturday's contest will be Denver's fifth in seven nights. League-worst Washington (14-51) has played well lately by going 5-4 over its last nine games. The Wizards split a two-game series in Detroit, taking the latter one 129-125 on Thursday. Washington outscored the Pistons 33-24 in the final quarter. Guys just stepped up, Washington coach Brian Keefe said. Everybody was supporting each other. Whoever is out there, got it done. … Guys stepped up when their opportunity was there. It's great. Seven Wizards scored between 14 and 19 points in a truly balanced effort. Alex Sarr had team highs of 19 points and four blocked shots and he also scored the go-ahead dunk with 53.6 seconds to play. Poole and Justin Champagnie scored 17 points apiece and Khris Middleton and Bub Carrington each added 16. Marcus Smart had 15 points and Corey Kispert added 14. Carrington said Tuesday's 123-103 loss to the Pistons was a motivating factor. It's a mix of discipline and individual pride, Carrington said. We knew we had to keep our intensity.|2025-03-16|https://www.wjoxam.com/news/nikola-jokic-nuggets-have-motivation-against-lowly-wizards/
FLORIDA — US President Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he has ordered decisive military action against Houthis in Yemen, escalating efforts against the group that has targeted shipping lanes in the Red Sea. Trump stated that the U.S. will deploy overwhelming lethal force against the Houthis until we have achieved our objective. They have waged an unrelenting campaign of piracy, violence, and terrorism against American and other ships, aircraft, and drones, Trump wrote on Truth Social. He confirmed that U.S. forces are carrying out aerial strikes on Houthi bases, leadership, and missile defenses to protect American shipping and restore navigational freedom in international waters. No terrorist force will stop American commercial and naval vessels from freely sailing the waterways of the world, he declared. Trump had approved the strike plan several weeks ago, with the final order given on Saturday. U.S. officials described the military operation as a sustained attack on Houthi positions in Yemen, with further actions in the coming weeks based on battle damage assessments. The Houthis have repeatedly targeted international shipping in the Red Sea, claiming their attacks are in retaliation for Israel's military campaign in Gaza. The group has launched drones, missiles, and small boat strikes against more than 100 vessels in the past year. The Biden administration had previously conducted targeted strikes on Houthi positions, including weapons storage facilities, but failed to deter further attacks. The Houthis had previously stated they would cease attacks on Red Sea ships if Israel maintained a ceasefire with Hamas. This is not a one-off. This is the beginning of an ongoing series of events that will last days, if not weeks, a source familiar with the military strategy told CNN. There is not and will not be an invasion or troops on the ground. But there will be a series of ongoing strategic targeted attacks. Earlier this year, Trump signed an order designating the Houthis as a foreign terrorist organization. In his statement, Trump also issued a strong warning to Iran, which provides financial and military support to the Houthis. To Iran: Support for the Houthi terrorists must end IMMEDIATELY! Do NOT threaten the American people, their President, or worldwide shipping lanes, he wrote. If you do, BEWARE, because America will hold you fully accountable, and we won't be nice about it! At least nine people were killed and nine others injured in the attacks on the Yemeni capital, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. Trump criticized the Biden administration's approach, calling it pathetically weak, and said Houthi attacks had cost the U.S. and the global economy billions of dollars while endangering innocent lives. To all Houthi terrorists, YOUR TIME IS UP, AND YOUR ATTACKS MUST STOP, STARTING TODAY. IF THEY DON'T, HELL WILL RAIN DOWN UPON YOU LIKE NOTHING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN BEFORE! Trump warned. — CNN|2025-03-16|https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/650164/World/Trump-orders-decisive-military-action-against-Houthis-in-Yemen
topic can be read here and here. Born in Springfield, Illinois in 1902, Louise Leland was the daughter of Jerome and Gertrude Akin Leland. Jerome was a descendant of the Lelands connected with some of the country's earliest examples of fine hotels (examples include: Metropolitan Hotel and Sturtevant House, New York City; Grand Union Hotel, Saratoga Springs; Occidental Hotel, San Francisco and Leland Hotel, Springfield). He was himself employed in both farming and real estate. Gertrude was the daughter of ex-Attorney General Akin. The couple was divorced by 1909; Jerome stayed in Springfield, while Gertrude moved north to Chicago with their children, Edward and Louise. Gertrude worked as a social worker and she later traveled abroad in March of 1918 to both France and England in order to aid in the war effort, specifically YMCA's Canteen Service.

She continued to practice until her death on September 9, 1956. (Courtesy Kentucky State Board of Architects) Louise was educated at Chicago Latin School for Girls, as well as Cottage School in Riverside, Illinois and Kemper Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1919 she enrolled at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. While at Smith she experienced the death of both her mother and her brother (more on her brother's death can be found here). Despite these heartbreaks, Louise maintained decent grades and an active schedule while at Smith. She was involved in numerous activities, perhaps most regularly with the All-Smith Baseball Team, of which she captained all four years. Louise Leland was awarded license number 183 on January 4, 1938. She continued to become registered in Kentucky from 1938 (the date of her successful test completion) until 1975. So what brought Louise to Kentucky? The same things that bring many of us (or at least me!) here—love and work. While at Cambridge Louise met Anne Bruce Haldeman and the two moved to Kentucky in order to live and work together. You can read more about their work in a post I wrote earlier this year.

She graduated in 1933 and one year later sat for the board exams required of all would-be architects. It is worth noting that Louise was the only Kentucky candidate to sit for the 1934 exams and the first (and only) woman to become registered in Kentucky from 1938 (the date of her successful test completion)|2025-03-16|https://brokensidewalk.com/2015/louise-leland/
- Advertisement - The Commonwealth Secretary-General, the Rt Hon Patricia Scotland KC, addressed leaders from 121 Non-Aligned Movement countries, calling for greater cooperation to protect all humanity from overlapping economic, environmental and security challenges. She was speaking at the 19th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement in Kampala, Uganda, on 20 January 2024. Addressing leaders, foreign affairs ministers and strategic partners as an official observer, the Secretary-General said: Our world is tightly bound by a tangled knot of crises spanning global economic, environmental and security systems. These crises are serious, complex and increasingly entrenched. Overcoming them will require a level of international political and economic cooperation, which is unprecedented in this century. While acknowledging the immense pressure on the multilateral system, she remained optimistic, adding: Together, we have the power to shift the balance of our fracturing world from mistrust and confrontation to dialogue and collaboration. Your perspectives are essential, and your action is imperative. Touching on the disproportionate impacts of the climate crisis on people, communities and economies across the Commonwealth, the Secretary-General recounted the recent devastation in Vanuatu – a member of both the Commonwealth and the Non-Aligned Movement. She said: The beautiful island nation of Vanuatu was devastated by category five Cyclone Lola last year, which hit seven months after the twin cyclones Judy and Kevin wiped out 50 per cent of the country's GDP, with rebuilding efforts now estimated at 80 per cent of GDP. Expressing concern over the absence of adequate international support for climate-vulnerable developing countries, the Secretary-General stressed that the limitations of the global financial system are letting many countries down. With no alternative, she added, many developing countries are forced to borrow loans for rebuilding on unfavourable terms, resulting in a vicious cycle of unsustainable debt . Research reveals that many climate-vulnerable developing countries spend more on external debt payments than on projects to protect people from the impacts of climate change. In response, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland repeated her call for the reform of the global financial system, adding: We need to rewire the entire system, with action rooted in the sharpest honesty about where we are, driven by evidence, and flowing through every sector: from finance, energy and trade to health, education, and digitalisation. In all of this, we must work and act together. Without meaningful reform, she warned of setbacks in the fulfilment of human rights, basic needs, and the Sustainable Development Goals. The Secretary-General further pledged her commitment to the reform process, stating: The Commonwealth will not rest until all countries, from the largest to the smallest, have an equal say in decisions affecting them. In closing, Secretary-General Scotland thanked the Non-Aligned Movement, which shares 44 of its 121 members with the Commonwealth, for its longstanding engagement with the Commonwealth. She congratulated President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda on his chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement and promised the Commonwealth's full support during his term. The Secretary-General also thanked Azerbaijan, the outgoing chair of the Non-Aligned Movement, adding: I pay tribute to His Excellency President Aliyev of Azerbaijan for his stewardship of the Non-Aligned Movement over the last four difficult years and commend his government for stepping forward to host the next United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku later this year. During the summit, the Secretary-General also met with leaders from Commonwealth countries to discuss shared interests and opportunities for further collaboration.|2025-03-16|https://antiguaobserver.com/cooperation-only-path-to-protecting-humanity-from-ongoing-crises-commonwealth-secretary-general-tells-non-aligned-movement-summit/
SANAA, Yemen At least nine people were killed and another nine were injured in US-UK airstrikes targeting Yemen's capital Sanaa, the Houthis said on Saturday, as President Donald Trump announced major air raids against the group. Nine civilians were martyred and nine others injured, most in critical condition, in an initial toll of the US-UK aggression airstrikes targeting civilian sites in the capital, Sanaa, the Health Ministry told Houthi-affiliated SABA news agency. Earlier, the Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah television channel also reported that Sanaa was targeted. It said the strikes struck residential neighborhoods in Shu'aub district, north of the capital. Trump on Truth Social said he ordered the military to launch powerful and decisive action against the Houthis. Your time is up, and your attacks must stop, starting today. If they don't, hell will rain down upon you like nothing you have ever seen before, Trump said. Witnesses told Anadolu that airstrikes also hit the Geraf neighborhood in northern Sanaa, resulting in powerful explosions. In solidarity with Gaza, Houthis had attacked Israeli-linked ships in the Red Sea with missiles and drones since late 2023, disrupting global trade. The group halted its attacks when the Gaza ceasefire was declared in January. But it threatened to resume the attacks when Israel blocked all aid into Gaza after the end of the first phase of the ceasefire on March 2.|2025-03-16|https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/houthis-say-9-killed-in-us-uk-airstrikes-on-yemen-s-capital-sanaa/3510748
